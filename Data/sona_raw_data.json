{"delivered": "1937-10-18 11:53:02+00:00", "author": "Manuel L. Quezon", "text": "[Delivered at the Opening of the Second Session of the National Assembly, in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on October 18, 1937]\r\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nAt no time in ancient or contemporary history has Almighty God showered His blessings upon our beloved country as generously as He has done during this year that is about to close. In a spirit of humility and thankfulness to Him, I come to report to you that the finances of the Government are sounder than they have ever been, that our foreign and internal trade has increased, that more school houses and roads have been built and opened to the people, that public health is in good condition, and that peace and order prevail in every province, city, municipality, and barrio of the Archipelago.\r\nIn this year too, as the highest representative of our people, I have taken a step that is of the greatest moment to the Fatherland. In my recent trip abroad I proposed to the President of the United States that he recommend to the Congress the granting of complete independence to the Philippines either on the 30\r\nof December 1938, or the 4\r\nof July, 1939.\r\nI feel certain that in making this petition I have expressed the views of the immense majority of our people and that it is better for us to be independent now, that is to say, as soon as the necessary steps could be taken for the orderly process of erecting an independent Republic, rather than in 1946.\r\nI can see no valid reason why, if the Philippines can be given independence in 1946, she may not have it in 1938 or 1939. In the short span of seven years the Filipino people can hardly do anything that would substantially change their present situation. Any obstacle which would vitally affect the chances of a successful and lasting independent nationhood in 1939 cannot be overcome by 1946.\r\nSo, if we want independence at any cost and are ready to take all the consequences \u2013the dangers as well as the advantages of independent national existence- let us have it no later than 1939. If, however, we are fearful of the possible threats that complete independence may offer to our national security, and we would rather remain under the protecting wing of the United States, then let us leave the final determination of our future to come coming generations and not deceive ourselves with the groundless hope that by 1946 we shall have become politically and economically beyond any serious difficulty.\r\nWe cannot be hesitating indefinitely. The best interest, indeed the very life, of the nation is at stake. If it is our resolve to be an independent nation, this is the time, for every year lost is to our evident disadvantage.\r\nOur duty \u2013the duty of the Executive and Legislative branches of the government- is plain. Under the Independence Act and the Constitution, the Government of the Commonwealth has been established to prepare the country for complete independence. Our people alone, by their own choice and direction, can command us to take a different course.\r\nSince the news of my proposal to have the transition period shortened was published, voices in opposition to it have been heard both in public and in private. Let me say in all earnestness to those Filipinos who believe in good faith that the security, liberty, prosperity, and peace of our common country lie in some kind of political partnership with the United States rather than in complete independence, that they should say so frankly and come out courageously in the open with an alternative plan, instead of merely adopting dilatory tactics in the belief that when the fourth of July, 1946, shall have arrived, some unforeseen event will prevent the establishment of the Philippine Republic. They have nothing to fear: there is here freedom of thought and of speech, and one may be as much a patriot advocating some other political status for the Philippines as favoring complete independence so long as in advocating he is inspired not by selfish motives but by what he honestly believes is for the commonweal. As long as the essentials of freedom are not sacrificed \u2013and they must not be sacrified under any consideration- the formula for securing and enjoying it may well be debated upon.\r\nIt is true that from the point of view of a foreigner who does not intend to remain in the Philippines after independence shall have been granted and who is contemplating to liquidate his interests in this country, the remaining seven years may, perhaps, give him the opportunity to withdraw his investments. But, is this a sufficient reason to postpone the grant of independence if, on the other hand, it would be to the best permanent interests of the Filipino people to accelerate its grant? Is the future well-being of a whole nation to be sacrificed for the benefit of a few foreigners? Do these foreigners have any right to a special consideration?\r\nFrom the very first day of America\u2019s occupation of the Philippines, she disclaimed any intention to permanently hold these Islands. Neither did she, in thus announcing to the whole world her intentions, ever give any promise either directly or by implication that she would not withdraw her sovereignty from her newly-occupied territory at a moment\u2019s notice. Therefore, foreigners who had investments in the Philippines when the United States took possession of the Islands, as well as those who came thereafter, knew full well that they were not placing themselves under the protection of the American flag except for as long a time only, and no longer, as the Government of the United States decided to retain the Philippines.\r\nWith more reason should these foreigners have known that the days of American sovereignty were numbered when, in 1916, the Jones Law was enacted, for it was solemnly and clearly declared in that law that the Philippines would be granted her independence as soon as a stable government could be established in this country. Since the question of the stability of a government is a matter of opinion, and in the case of the Government of the Philippines, the Congress alone has the right to determine the question, that pronouncement in the Jones Law was tantamount to a formal notice to all concerned that the United States might, at any time, leave the Islands to their own fate.\r\nIt is true that when the Independence Act was approved by the Congress in 1934, it was specifically provided therein that complete independence would be granted ten years following the inauguration of the Government of the Commonwealth; but the reports of the respective Committees and the speeches delivered upon the floor of both Houses of the Congress clearly show this was not a commitment addressed to foreigners having investments in the Philippines, but only to the Filipino people who, in the opinion of the Congress, might be seriously injured economically if their trade relations with the United States were abruptly terminated. If the Filipino people themselves are willing to have the date for the granting of independence advanced, there is nothing, expressed or implied, in the Independence Law that denies them the right to ask the Congress to shorten the transition period.\r\nMy main reason for asking that the independence of the Philippines be granted not later than the 4\r\nof July, 1939, is that I am sincerely of the opinion that it will be to our best interests to secure independence during and under the administration of President Roosevelt. I know the President, his progressive and liberal ideas, his very deep sense of justice, and his friendship for and good will towards the Filipino people. I have no doubt that under his leadership we will receive from the Government of the United States the fairest treatment that we may ever expect to receive under the leadership of his successors. And if the Philippines were to become independent not later than the fourth of July, 1939, President Roosevelt would still have more than one full year to extend his helping hand to the new Philippine Republic in the early stages of its dealings as an independent nation both with the United States and the rest of the world. We could, indeed, find no better sponsor than President Roosevelt to usher the Philippines into the family of free nations.\r\nMoreover, the experience of the last two years has shown that, although the avowed purpose of the ten-year transition period is to stabilize the trade relations between the United States and the Philippines, as provided in the Independence Act, so as to give the Filipino people a basis for making readjustments in their national economy preparatory to the change that complete independence would bring with it, there were tendencies in Congress to disregard the terms and conditions governing said trade relations even against the will of the Filipino people.\r\nIn proposing to President Roosevelt that he recommend to the Congress the shortening of the period for the grant of independence, I also asked that the present trade relations between the United States and the Philippines be continued for at least ten years after independence. If this were done and made a part of a treaty between the Government of the United States and the Philippine Republic the trade relations between the two countries would have been placed on a stable basis during the life of the treaty.\r\nI know that there are people who believe that these trade relations only benefit the Philippines at the expense of the American people. As far as I am concerned, I would never ask from the United States anything that we could not reciprocate in kind. If U advocate the temporary continuance of the present trade relations between America and the Philippines it is because I am convinced that these trade relations are mutually beneficial to both countries.\r\nThere is another vital reason why the date for the granting of independence should be advanced. The present political set-up is untenable in that while America retains her sovereign authority over the Philippines, she, at the same time, has placed in the hands of the Filipino people the responsibility for laying down the foundations and erecting the structure of the Philippine Republic. The continuation of her sovereignty over the Philippines imposes upon America obligations she cannot shirk, and, correspondingly, it gives her rights that are incompatible with the free exercise of our judgment as to the best means that we should adopt to prepare ourselves for an independent national existence. Conflicts of views, and perhaps of interests, may arise during the coming next eight years that may create misunderstanding and ill-feelings between the American and Filipino peoples and mar the unprecedented record of perfect cooperation and goodwill between two dissimilar races which Fate has thrown together temporarily. As long as America was the sovereign authority and reserved for herself and exercised full power over, and assumed exclusive responsibility for, the Government of the Philippines, there was no occasion for conflict. Her word was then final in all matters of public policy, and our duty was merely to cooperate with her, as we did cooperate under her authority and direction.\r\nUpon the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth, however, the situation has changed materially. By an Act of Congress, we were given power to create our own government, controlled and managed by us, under a Constitution of our own making. It was the plain purpose of the Congressional enactment that the Filipino people, who were to become automatically independent in 1946, would, during the Commonwealth period, take such steps, as in their opinion would best ensure the stability and success of the Philippine Republic. Yet, the powers granted to the Government of the Commonwealth in the most important and essential functions of government, such as those affecting trarrif, currency, finance, immigration, or those which in any way might involve the international obligations of the United States, etc., were subject to the ultimate approval of, or revocation by, the President of the United States.\r\nIt must be recognized, on the one hand, that America cannot, in fairness to herself, concede more governmental powers to the Commonwealth than she has granted without endangering her own interest and peace, nor on the other hand, can the Filipino people assume responsibility for their due preparation for independence with only such limited powers as have been vested in the Commonwealth Government. In this predicament, it were better for America and the Philippines to be independent of each other so that each may be free to act in the furtherance of her own national objectives and interests.\r\nWe have been fortunate indeed that so far the representatives of the President of the United States in the Philippines have been men of the highest character and integrity, of broad statesmanship, and of a clear vision of the task entrusted to them. You all know former High Commissioner Frank Murphy. His relations with us, not only as High Commissioner but also as Governor-General, have been very close and most cordial. In both capacities he has rendered permanent service to our people. In my last trip to America he has proven to me that his interest in our liberty and well-being is abiding.\r\nThe present United States High Commissioner has been but a few months in our midst. Some of his early acts were misrepresented or misunderstood. For a time there were some misgivings on the part of our people as to his attitude towards them and this Government. But nothing can dispel misunderstandings quicker than personal contact.\r\nIt is my pleasure and my duty to report to you \u2013and what I am going to say is no mere gesture of official courtesy, but an honest and straight talk- that I could wish for no better United States High Commissioner in the Philippines than His Excellency, Paul V. McNutt. He measures up to his exalted position, both as an official and as a man. Indeed, it is a very difficult choice to make between Mr. McNutt, the man, and His Excellency, the High Commissioner.\r\nSince my return, we have had some difficult problems to settle and I had occasion to appraise the true measure of him who now represents the President of the United States in the Philippines. He deserves our respect and affection. The best spirit of mutual cooperation characterizes our official association, and we have also become good friends. I feel confident that in serving his government and his country, High Commissioner McNutt will be of invaluable help to the Filipino people.\r\nHappy and fruitful as our association with the American High Commissioner has been, I must state in all candor that these two short years of the life of the Commonwealth have already revealed some signs of the possibility of a serious conflict between the High Commissioner and the President of the Philippines in the performance of their respective duties even if each were desirous of avoiding such conflict. Perhaps there will always be found a way to arrive at some reasonable compromise as long as President Roosevelt is at the head of the American Government, and if his representative in our country were of the caliber of the two High Commissioners we have had until now; especially if the President of the Philippines understood American psychology and realized America\u2019s difficult situation during this twilight period of our nationhood. But who can foretell what will happen if another President should be in the White House, or a less sympathetic man should represent the President of the United States in the Philippines, or a Filipino President should be one entirely foreign to American ways or one-sided in his views of American-Filipino relations? The only sure remedy to this dangerous situation is to terminate it with the least possible delay.\r\nNo better evidence could have been given by President Roosevelt of his deep concern for the future welfare of our people than by the appointment of the Joint Preparatory Committee which is now sitting in conference in our country.\r\nThe following statement given out jointly by Mr. Sayre, Assistant Secretary of State, as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, and myself on March 18, 1937, gives a complete idea of the reason for, and the object of, the creation of this Committee:\r\n\u201cArrangements are being made for the appointment shortly of a joint preparatory committee of American and Philippine experts. The committee is to study trade relations between the United States and the Philippines and to recommend a program for the adjustment of Philippine national economy. This announcement followed conferences between President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth and the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, which is acting on behalf of President Roosevelt in the preliminary discussions. Assistant Secretary of State Francis B. Sayre is Chairman of this Committee.\r\n\u201cInasmuch as the Independence Act provides that complete political independence of the Philippines shall become effective on July 4, 1946, and inasmuch as President Quezon has suggested that the date of independence might be advanced to 1938 or 1939, it was agreed that the joint committee of experts would be expected in making its recommendations to consider the bearing which an advancement in the date of independence would have on facilitating or retarding the execution of a program of economic adjustment in the Philippines. It was further agreed that the preferential trade relations between the United States and the Philippines are to be terminated at the earliest practicable date consistent with affording the Philippines a reasonable opportunity to adjust their national economy. Thereafter, it is contemplated that trade relations between the two countries will be regulated in accordance with a reciprocal trade agreement on a non-preferential basis.\u201d\r\nThe members of the Joint Committee appointed by the Inter-Departmental Committee with the approval of President Roosevelt and by me are the following:\r\nHis Excellency, the United States Ambassador to Turkey, Hon. John Van A. MacMurray, Chairman of the Committee.\r\nBen Dorfman of the United States Tariff Commission and Benito Razon, Economic Adviser to the President, were later on appointed to the Committee as alternates.\r\nThis Committee held hearings in Washington, San Francisco, and Manila; and it also visited most of the provinces of the Philippines to secure first-hand information that would be valuable to the members of the Committee in making their report and final recommendation on the task entrusted to them.\r\nAfter this Committee shall have submitted its report, it is my purpose to reiterate my petition that the granting of complete independence to the Philippines be advanced either to the 30\r\nof December, 1938, or to the 4\r\nof July, 1939, unless the National Assembly, during its present session, should express a contrary opinion.\r\nLet me now turn your attention to our most immediate economic and social problems. The Philippines has undoubtedly made great strides both in the field of politics and of economics during the last three decades. Politically, we have reached the point where we are \u2013having an almost entirely autonomous government and the assurance of complete independence. Economically, we have become an important factor in American commerce; our foreign and domestic trade has multiplied \u2013in a word, the national wealth has greatly increased. We have accomplished, too, considerable progress in sanitation, in education, in the construction of roads and all kinds of communications, and we have acquired the modern conveniences of life. But the main beneficiaries of this most remarkable progress are the rich and the middle class. The rich can live in extravagant luxury. Some of their offspring grow up in an atmosphere of ease, with an outlook on life which gives paramount important to society affairs, vanities, trivialities and material possessions, devoid of discipline, love for work or human sympathy. The middle class have attained a higher standard of living as compared with that prevailing during the Spanish regime. The comforts of present-day civilization are within their reach and they are enjoying them. Their sons and daughters are better-fed, better clothed, better educated \u2013thousands upon thousands of them are now receiving the benefits of higher instruction.\r\nSad to tell, but it is none the less true, the same cannot be said of our laboring population. The men and women who till the soil or work in the factories are hardly better off now than they were during the Spanish regime. Of course, wages are higher than in any other Oriental country, with the possible exception of Japan. But it should be remembered that money could buy more in those Spanish days than it can now; and furthermore in the relationship between employer and employee in the days of old there was a consideration of higher value to the employee than the monetary compensation itself. Of yore employers and employees lived in personal contact and association resembling that which exists amongst members of the same family so that ties of affection bound them together much more than material considerations. Now this no longer obtains for their relationship is almost as impersonal and detached as that existing between employers and employees in highly industrialized countries. Again, our ancestors, because of their greater ignorance, knew no better and were resigned to their hard life, believing that it was a part of the world order as decreed by Divine Will, so that the unfortunate sufferer may meet with a greater reward in Heaven.\r\nNow the Filipino workingman, however illiterate, refuses to believe that the Creator of the Universe could have ordained that some of His creatures should live in luxury and plenty, while others, in destitution and misery. The Filipino laborer now knows that the Father of mankind loves him as much as every other human being, and, therefore, that the world has not been made for the benefit of a few, but for the happiness of all.\r\nStill more: The Filipino workingman has heard, if he is not able to read, of the equality before the law of the poor and the rich. He has heard of democracy, liberty, and justice, since every candidate for an elective office discourses on these topics, painting to him in glowing terms the meaning of these words.\r\nAnd yet, what does he actually see? How do these doctrines that he has heard propounded from the platforms affect his everyday life? His hopes have been raised, his vision has been broadened, and his outlook has been painted in bright colors. But thirty-five years of American regime has brought him only disappointments and, sometimes, despair.\r\nHas the progress then made by the Philippines benefited our poorer population? Rhe poor still has to drink the same polluted water that his ancestors drank for ages. Malaria, dysentery, and tuberculosis still threaten him and his family at every turn. His children cannot all go to school, or if they do, they cannot even finish the whole primary instruction for one reason or another.\r\nRoads from his barrio or his little farm to the town there are none. Only trails are within his reach \u2013trails that have been formed by the daily pressure of his bare feet and not because they have been constructed. As he works from sunrise to sundown, his employer gets richer while he remains poor. He is the easy prey of the heartless usurer because usury is still rampant everywhere despite legislative enactments intended to suppress it.\r\nThat is, concisely speaking, the lot of the common man in our midst, after America\u2019s long endeavor to give to all fair opportunity in the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of life.\r\nIt was, of course, impossible for American administrators to see and reach the lowest strata of our population. But now that the reins of government are in our hands in so far as our own domestic affairs are concerned, what excuse, what reasonable justification can there be in allowing such a social and economic order to continue?\r\nIt is high time that all the branches of this Government cooperate with one another, and with them the whole community and every good-hearted man and woman, so that at last in this dear land of ours social justice \u2013real justice- in the relations of man to man, may reign supreme.\r\nOur people are patient and law-abiding. They love peace. They have not lost their faith either in the executive, the legislative, or the judicial branch of the Government. As the Government is now in the hands of their own countrymen, they have become hopeful and are placing the realization of their dream for a better day in our clearer understanding of their lot, our better knowledge of conditions prevailing in the country, and in what should be the natural craving of our hearts to serve them with all the power at our command \u2013they who are flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood.\r\nThe promotion of social justice by the State is a clear and categorical mandate of our Constitution. Our platform, the platform upon which you and I have been elected, imposes upon us the high duty of enacting measures that will improve the living conditions of the laborer and of carrying these measures into effect. We must see that laws are enacted which will not permit the exploitation of the employee by his employer and which will leave no loopholes that may be used to defeat the ends of justice. We must rely for the security of this new nation, not so much upon the might of brute force, but upon the undivided loyalty of every citizen to the Government \u2013a loyalty founded upon individual consciousness that this Government is his, and that it exists only for his protection, for his liberty, and for his happiness.\r\nBoth the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor are ready to help you in the preparation of the measures that are required to fill the gap that may be found in our existing legislation, for the purpose of correcting prevailing social evils and of carrying into effect the provisions of the Constitution as well as the commitments in our platform.\r\nFortunately for us a new source of income has come to our hands that will facilitate the carrying out of our program of social justice and economic readjustment. From the proceeds of the excise tax on oil there has been accumulated up to the end of June, 1937, the sum of P96,507,227.30 in the Federal Treasury, the transfer of which amount to the Treasury of the Philippines I had secured before I left America on my last trip. This sum is now available for appropriation, the understanding with the Treasury Department of the United States being that out of that fund, P10,000,000 will be available upon thirty days\u2019 notice and the balance upon ninety days\u2019 notice.\r\nThe final decision as to how this fund shall be spent is, of course, yours. But in the exercise of my constitutional prerogative I shall take the liberty of making some suggestions regarding the purposes for which this money should be spent.\r\nThe first thing that we must bear in mind is that this fund does not constitute an ordinary income of the Government upon which we may depend for recurring obligations. When independence shall have been granted, this source of our income will cease. Were we to defray from this fund services that we cannot maintain once this income is terminated, we would have thrown away the money thus spent. We must, therefore, limit the use of this fund for national objectives, for purposes where the greater good may be derived by the Filipino people.\r\nConcretely, I recommend that this fund be devoted to the following purposes:\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 To improve sanitary conditions of centers of population by constructing water systems or artesian wells.\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 For combating malaria where there is assurance that it can be done at a reasonable expense.\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 For the prevention of tuberculosis and the establishment of more sanitoriums, as it is well known that the white plague is the worst scourge afflicting our race.\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 For the building of new leprosariums which will permit lepers in the early stage of the disease to be treated where they may be easily reached by their families, thus making their isolation less tragic.\r\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 For extending free dispensary service to the poor not only in centers of population but also in outlying barrios and communities.\r\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 For building public schools in every barrio where there is a sufficient number of children justifying the opening of the school.\r\nIn this connection, I desire to state that it was with great reluctance that I vetoed the bill passed in your last sessions appropriating funds for school buildings. A subcommittee of the Committee on Public Instruction came to see me to secure my approval to a measure that would appropriate P5,000,000 for school buildings even before approving the regular budget of the Government. The Department of Public Instruction is now ready to furnish you with all the necessary information.\r\nThe Constitution imposes upon the Government of the Philippines the duty to give every boy and girl of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction. As soon as there are sufficient school buildings to accommodate all the school-age population of the Philippines and permanent means for supporting the schools have been created, there should be implanted here, in my opinion, compulsory universal primary instruction. In the meantime we should make it compulsory for every boy and girl who is now in our public schools, and those who may be admitted next year and thereafter to remain in school during the period required for the entire primary instruction. Means should be immediately provided to carry this policy into effect.\r\nOne of the discoveries which we have made since the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth is that, despite the large number of children that have gone through our public schools, as shown in the reports of the Bureau of Education, the literacy of the Islands has not increased proportionally, and the knowledge of those rudimentary subjects which the citizen of a democracy should have, has not been acquired by a population corresponding to the number of children that appear to have entered the public schools. The reason for this is simple. A large proprtion of the boys and girls who have been admitted to the schools have not remained long enough to acquire any kind of useful knowledge.\r\n7.\u00a0\u00a0 For opening national highways and helping in the construction of provincial and even barrio roads whenever the respective provinces and municipalities pledge themselves to maintain the roads thus constructed, and in the case of barrio roads, where the volume of traffic on said roads also justifies their construction.\r\n8.\u00a0\u00a0 For the construction of office buildings for the National Government so as to reduce, if not eliminate, the continuous expense in rents.\r\n9.\u00a0\u00a0 For the purchase of large landed estates and their resale in small lots to the actual occupants thereof.\r\nWe are committed to the policy of acquiring the haciendas which, in the opinion of the Government, should be subdivided in small lots and resold to the tenants actually working on said lots. In a message to the National Assembly in its first regular session, I stated that we were not in a position to redeem this pledge, not only because we had no funds with which to purchase these estates, but also because I feared that we would only be transferring the trouble faced by the owners of these estates to the Government itself. Since then we have come into this fund accruing to the Commonwealth from the processing tax on oil, and I deem it proper and wise to use a part of it for the acquisition of these haciendas. In order that the Government may accomplish its objective more completely this time than when it brought the Friar lands, I have appointed a committee to study the whole question in its varied aspects with instructions to submit it recommendations not later than November 15, 1937. As soon as the committee submits its report, I shall refer the same to the National Assembly for such action as you may deem proper and expedient in the light of the recommendations therein contained.\r\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the development of water power, the reforestation of denuded areas, the colonization and development of Mindanao; and\r\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the financing of a long range program of economic adjustments necessary to prepare the country for the new situation attending the grant of our independence, including the establishment of new industries which at the same time will give work to the unemployed.\r\nIt is expected that the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs will include in its report a well considered program of economic adjustments to supplement its recommendation on future American-Philippine trade relations. As soon as this report has been received by me it will be immediately submitted to you for your consideration.\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, before closing, allow me to emphasize the need to of giving the common man in the Philippines the benefits that the citizenry of every progressive democracy is entitled to receive. I am sure that every one of you will give to this noble task the best that is in him. An opportunity has been offered us that no past or coming generation has had or will ever have \u2013that of creating a nation where there will be no privileged class, where poverty will be unknown, where every citizen will be duly equipped with the knowledge that will enable him to perform his duties and to exercise his rights properly and conscientiously, and where every man, woman, and child his fireside will be thankful to God for living in this beautiful and blessed land.", "title": "Improvement of Philippine Conditions, Philippine Independence, and Relations with American High Commissioner"},

Quezon", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on June 16, 1936]\r\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nSeven months ago this Commonwealth was inaugurated amidst the general rejoicing of our people, and with misgivings on the part of some timorous individuals. Today the Government of the Commonwealth counts with the confidence and respect of all. True, there are still a few prophets of disaster, but these need not seriously disturb us, for it is evident that it is only their wish that is father to their forebodings.\r\nUnder the provisions of the Independence Act incorporated into our Constitution, the Government of the United States retains direct control and supervision over our foreign affairs, as well as certain specific powers in a few cases of domestic character. These powers are vested in the President of the United States whose representative in the Islands is the United States High Commissioner. My personal and official relations with High Commissioner Frank Murphy have been most cordial, and the highest spirit of cooperation has characterized the transactions of our Government with the Washington Administration.\r\nIt was with a deep sense of loss that our people saw High Commissioner Murphy depart for the United States and it is their hope that he will soon return to the Philippines.\r\nIt is with regret that I have to inform you that the Senate of the United States has passed a bill repealing the Act recognizing the equity of the Philippine Government on the sum of P47,000,000 arising from the devaluation of the dollar as a reimbursement for the depreciation of our reserves deposited in the United States. Were this bill to pass Congress, our Government would be made to incur a loss or that American officials have done contrary to the recommendation of Filipino representatives. I have not, however, given up the hope that the House of Representatives will not follow the action of the Senate, for I cannot conceive that America, which in this case acted as the guardian of Filipino interests, should want to profit from the losses of her ward. I know that High Commissioner Murphy has done and is doing everything he can to secure this fund for the Philippines.\r\nAgain there are attempts to enact legislation reverting to the Treasury of the United States the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil imported from the Philippines. The amount of collections is now around P56,000,000 and is deposited in the United States Treasury. Payment to the Government of the Philippines in accordance with the law has been suspended in view of cases pending in the courts contesting the validity of the law. It is my earnest belief that Congress will not approve the proposed legislation above referred to. Heretofore, whenever the Congress of the United States has taxed goods or products imported into the United States from the Philippines, invariably it has provided the payment of all collections to our Government. It is, therefore, beyond my comprehension that at this stage of our relations with America that record of fair dealing and justice should be reversed. We are also counting upon the help of Commissioner Murphy and other friends in Congress to prevent the enactment of the said law.\r\nI am happy to be able to inform the Assembly that the foreign population of the Islands has, since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, shown a genuine desire to cooperate with our people to make this government a signal success.\r\nMuch has been printed in the local and foreign papers regarding the ownership of large tracts of land by Japanese subjects in Davao. There is an impression that Davao is actually owned by the Japanese. Such is not the case.\r\nThe total area owned, leased and/or cultivated by the Japanese in Davao is about 60,000 hectares out of almost two million hectares that constitute the total area of the public domain in that province. It is true that Japanese investments in Davao are considerable, and that there are doubts expressed as to the legality of some of the transactions entered into between Filipinos and Japanese regarding the public domain leased to Filipinos by the Government. In these cases the Government will act in accordance with law and equity. Before any course of action is finally decided upon by the Administration, I shall advise with the Assembly and take no step without your previous knowledge. There is nothing in the so-called Davao problem that should cause serious concern.\r\nThe country has never been entirely free from armed bandits or outlaws as it has been during the last four months. At the beginning of the present administration there were two armed bands which had been marauding in the Provinces of Laguna and Tayabas for some time, and there was at large one notorious bandit in the Province of Lanao who for many years had been terrorizing that district with murders and robberies. Two hours after my inauguration as Chief Executive I had a conference with the governors of Laguna and Tayabas and the Chief of Constabulary, and I instructed them to spare no effort in the capture or extermination of these outlaws. Soon thereafter the Lanao bandit having resisted arrest was killed by the Constabulary and within two months every members of the armed bands in Laguna and Tayabas had been either captured or killed. However, there is still the danger of possible sporadic public disturbances like the uprising of the Sakdalistas which took place a year ago last May. Professional demagogues who make their living by exploiting the patriotism of the uninformed or the real or fancied grievances of the discontented, are exciting the masses with incendiary speeches and literature. Communism has also been active during the last few years and while its propaganda has not been particularly effective the forces of law and order have to be constantly on guard. There is not, of course, the slightest danger of any general uprising, but we cannot allow any serious disturbance of the public order to take place. One of the few cases which may give occasion for American intervention is the failure of the Government to preserve order and to protect life, property, and individual liberty. The world is watching this experiment in Filipino self-government, and the confidence and respect which in the future the nations may have in the Philippine Republic will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain peace and order and to extend effective protection to all the residents of the Islands during the transition period. Knowing as I do the great superiority of the forces of the Government over any misguided group that may be induced to armed revolt, it causes me anguish to think that under my administration the armed forces of the government may be compelled to take such drastic measure as would exact a greater toll of life than during the Sakdalista uprising. From every point of view, therefore, it is better that preventive measures be taken, and it is my earnest hope that the National Assembly will not delay the enactment of appropriate legislation to this end.\r\nWhile the Government cannot compromise with public disorder, it is equally its duty to right social injustices. That our laborers in the farm as well as in the factories still suffer from long-standing unfair practices, no one can successfully deny. These injustices, however, cannot be remedied by merely applying here legislation in force in other countries. For such legislation would not take into account local conditions, nor the incipient stage of our industrial life and the almost primitive state of our agriculture. Government administration is a practical question and statesmanship consists in the wise application of sound doctrines bearing in mind the actual conditions that have to be met with in each case. Even the most up-to-date progressive labor legislation, if not in keeping with the prevailing conditions here, may easily upset our existing industries, preventing the establishment of new ones, and retard the advance of our agriculture. I, therefore, advocate a policy of progressive conservatism based upon the recognition of the essential and fundamental rights of labor.\r\nThe Philippine Legislature has in the past enacted several measures for the protection of labor, but while they have improved somewhat the lot of the workingman to the extent that the Filipino laborer enjoys more rights and privileges than his brother in other Oriental countries, it is necessary that we should go further and give better and more effective protection to the rights and interests of our wage-earners. I would, therefore, urge the enactment of a law authorizing the creation of boards of arbitration to settle questions of labor, minimum wages, working conditions, and other matters affecting their relations.\r\nWith the passage of the Tenancy Law, it was believed that the relationship between the landowner and tenant could be maintained on a fair and satisfactory basis. Although the legislation has been in the statute book for several years, I do not know of a single locality which has put it into effect, as its enforcement in any province was made dependent on an affirmative resolution of the majority of the municipal councils of that province. There is now more discontent and social unrest among the farm laborers than among the industrial workers. I believe this situation will be materially improved by the enactment of the Arbitration Board Law to which I have referred.\r\nThe large landed estates or \u201chaciendas\u201d offer a different problem. This administration, by the Coalition platform, is committed to the policy favoring the acquisition of these estates at a fair and just price, so they may be sold in small lots to the tenants. I regret to state that after a careful study of this question, I have reached the conclusion that such a step would not remedy the situation nor could it be carried out without exposing the country to great financial losses.\r\nImmediately after assuming office, I instructed the Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to give me the necessary information so that I might recommend to the National Assembly at this regular session the purchase of these landed estates or \u201chaciendas\u201d and their subsequent sale to the tenants. Both Secretaries of said Departments have personally investigated some of the outstanding controversies between some of the \u201chaciendas\u201d and their tenants, and I have also taken part in one of those investigations. I have likewise studied the effects of the purchase of the so-called friar lands.\r\nIt is now my earnest conviction that the purchase of these \u201chaciendas\u201d by the Government will not solve the agrarian and social problems existing therein, but will only transfer to the Government the difficulties which the tenants now have with the present landowners.\r\nThe friar lands were acquired by the Government for the purpose of reselling them in small parcels to the men who were working on these lands; but, for several causes, the result has been that a large area of these \u201chaciendas\u201d is now in the hands of other people. The lot of the former tillers of these lands has not in the least improved. The investment, therefore, of several millions of pesos by the Government in the purchase of the friar lands has only been, with few exceptions, for the benefit of people not contemplated by the Government. The latest report I have is that in this transaction the Government lost heavily. If the Philippine Government lost then when the price paid for the friar lands was relatively low, it is evident that now, that the price asked for these \u201chaciendas\u201d is very much higher, the Government is bound to suffer a greater loss. There might be some justification in exposing the country to this financial loss if, through such purchase, the majority of the people working on them were to become the owners of the land which they are now cultivating. I am positive, however, that such will not be the case, any more than it was in the case of the friar lands, and I, for one, despite the commitment in the Coalition platform, do not wish to impose upon our people the burden of a national debt which our children will have to bear merely to give a few individuals the opportunity to acquire these particular areas at the expense of the people when there is so much available fertile and untouched public land in many regions of our country, particularly in Mindanao.\r\nI realize the difficulty of convincing the men and their families who are now living in these \u201chaciendas\u201d to move out from their places of birth in order to settle in other provinces or islands, knowing as I do the attachment of the Filipino to his hometown. We must encourage our people to have a national outlook so that they may feel at home in whatever corner of the Philippines they may find themselves. We thus have an opportunity to induce the settlement of our sparsely populated areas by the tenants of these \u201chaciendas,\u201d and the money that the Government would surely lose with their purchase could be invested to better advantage in the construction of roads and improvement of health conditions in said uninhabited but rich sections of the Philippines.\r\nIn the meantime, I recommend the adoption of measures similar to those which were adopted in Ireland to solve agrarian problems there which have been existing from time immemorial. I also recommend the immediate passage of a law authorizing the expropriation of those portions of the large \u201chaciendas\u201d which are urban in character and are occupied by the houses of the tenants. With the opportunity to own their own homes thus assured, the settlement of the present difficulties of the tenants relative to their farm lands might no longer be of urgent necessity.\r\nIn your inaugural session, which lasted barely thirty days, you enacted the most important legislation pledged in the Coalition platform and urgently required by the nature of the new responsibilities of the present government. The record you have made has earned for you just commendation and constitutes the main reason for the prevailing confidence in our future. I now beg leave to report what has been done by Executive in compliance with your legislative enactments.\r\n\u2013Conscious of the fact that the prime duty of every government is to provide for national defense, the first measure you have enacted is the \u201cNational Defense Act\u201d (Commonwealth Act No. 1).\r\nThis Act provides for the reorganization of a defensive system composed of the Regular Force and a trained citizen army, and contemplates a yearly appropriation of P16,000,000 for ten years, at the end of which the nation will be placed in a position of serene dignity amongst the powers of the world.\r\nA comprehensive report of the steps taken in pursuance of the provisions of the National Defense Act has been submitted to be by the Military Adviser and it will be my pleasure to transmit it to you in a separate message. Suffice it for me to say now that the response of the country to the call of the Assembly has exceeded our fondest expectations. The number of Filipinos who enrolled on the date fixed for registration in accordance with the provisions of the National Defense Act was greatly in excess of what had been anticipated; in fact it was almost double our estimates. The school teachers who were given instructions in training camps to equip them with the knowledge necessary to carry out the work assigned to them in the schools under the provisions of the National Defense Act, conducted themselves so well and their training was so successful that they deserve from me a well-merited public recognition. It has been plainly demonstrated that our people are ready for the supreme sacrifice in defense of their motherland and their liberty.\r\nI order to expedite the organization of the new Army, I made ad interim appointments to the positions of Chief and Deputy Chief of Staff, the Provost Marshal, and other high ranking officers. These appointments were made after a careful and impartial study of the record of every man and were made upon the recommendation of the Military Adviser of this Government.\r\nNo one better than I knows how essential it is to entirely disassociate the Army from politics and, as scrupulously in the rank and file as in the high command, to make merit as the one and only basis of promotion. The Army is a double-edged sword. It is the arm of the Government which is the last resort for the enforcement of the laws and so compel obedience to constituted authority, for the maintenance of peace and order, and for the defense of the national integrity and liberty. But as contemporary history proves to us, the army can also be a disturber of peace and the enemy of law and established government, and in many instances it has been the instrument for the overthrow of constitutional regime. In building up our national defense, and in organizing the regular armed forces of the Islands, these tragic lessons of history must be constantly borne in mind, and it behooves us, who are for the time being entrusted with the responsibility of leadership over our nation, to be forever watchful and vigilant lest we sow the seeds of a possible future misuse of our armed forces. A just and fair treatment for the Army and its rank and file, the upholding of civil authority over the military, insistence upon strict discipline within the organization, non-interference by outsiders, political or otherwise, and a rigid prohibition against the use of the organization or its members for political purposes \u2013these are the basic principles that must be faithfully adhered to in order to make the Philippine Army the safeguard of our liberties and constitutional government, as well as the bulwark of our national integrity and independence.\r\nDuring the brief period that I have been at the head of the Government, I have inspected most of the garrisons of the Philippine Army and Constabulary. I know and have known for years many of the officers of the organization and have had intimate relations with the high command. The discipline, the gentlemanly conduct, the devotion to duty, the patriotism and courage of the officers and men make me feel proud as a Filipino and as the Commander-in-Chief of these armed forces of the Commonwealth.\r\n\u2013Another important legislation which you passed in your inaugural session is that which creates the National Economic Council to advise the Government on economic and financial questions, including the improvement and promotion of industries, diversification of crops and production, tariffs, taxation, and such other matters as may from time to time be submitted so its consideration by the President, and to formulate an economic program based on national independence.\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I have appointed the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Philippine National Bank, the President of the National Development Company, the President of the Manila Railroad Company, Mr. Joaquin M. Elizalde, Hon. R.J. Fernandez, Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad, Mr. Vicente Madrigal, Hon. Francisco Varona, Mr. Ramon Soriano, Hon. Vicente Singson Encarnacion, Hon. Rafael R. Alunan and Dr. Manuel L. Roxas, as members of the National Economic Council and designated as Chairman thereof the Secretary of Finance. The Council was organized on February 14, 1936, and it commenced to function immediately thereafter.\r\nAs may be expected, considering the complex and highly technical character of the task entrusted to it, the National Economic Council has not so far submitted to the Government any economic program, nor has the Government sought the advice of the Council except on one question: namely, the advisability of creating the National Rice and Corn Corporation for the purpose of bringing about the stabilization of the price of rice, the most important staple food of our people, by protecting equally the producer and the consumer, and also to serve as an agency of the Government to meet local or national emergencies in cases of shortage of rice. It should be stated in all candor that it was only after a long debate inspired by honest differences of opinion that the National Economic Council gave its approval to this venture. Despite certain doubts expressed by some members of the Council, however, I am confident that the National Rice and Corn Corporation will ultimately solve the rice problem, one of the most serious national problems which for years has been confronting our country and which demanded immediate attention on account of its very serious implications.\r\nThe situation may be summarized as follows: The main food supply of the Filipinos, like that of most Orientals, is rice. For many years the country did not produce a sufficient quantity of rice for its consumption and the Government deemed it necessary even to borrow money for the purpose of establishing irrigation systems in order that the country may be self-sufficient in rice supply. Our yearly importation of this article amounted to many millions of pesos, reaching over P25,000,000 in one year. During the last two years we were able to produce practically all the rice needed for our consumption. But no sooner did we reach this stage than the price of rice went down, in fact so low that the rice farmer not only made no profit, but actually suffered considerable losses. As a consequence, there has been a growing discontent on the part of the rice growers, especially the tenants or\r\n, who are earning less than is required for the bare necessities of life. On the other hand, whenever, due to typhoons, drought, or floods there was a shortage of rice and prices reached high levels, either through the manipulations of a few conscienceless rice merchants or merely because of scarcity of supply, the consumer, especially the poor, became a victim of speculatory activities. To save them the Government had to intervene and take drastic measures at times in order to alleviate the crisis.\r\nIn spite of such a situation nothing has been attempted so far to remedy it, and this Administration felt that it was its duty, especially in view of the shortage of the last crop due to repeated typhoons and floods, to face the issue immediately and strive to solve the problem once and for all.\r\nIt is only natural that there should be some doubt or fear, and even resentment from some quarters, over the action of the Government; hence criticisms are being made in public and in private, and those who expected to make unreasonable profits from the rice crisis and were foiled in their anticipations, went so far as to see dishonest purposes in the creation of the Rice and Corn Corporation. All such doubts and criticisms, whether honest or malicious, did not deter the Administration from carrying out the plan that has been adopted, especially because no alternative had been suggested.\r\nTo meet the national emergency caused by the shortage of rice, I have designated the National Rice and Corn Corpation to act as the relief agency for the Government in place of the Bureau of Commerce which was in charge of this activity in the past. When the corporation started importing rice, the Collector of Customs, believing that the rice so imported must pay duties in view of the fact that it was being sold at some profit, informed the Secretary of Finance of his intention to collect such duties, and in fact did demand payment thereof by the Rice and Corn Corporation. After securing the legal opinion of the Secretary of Justice, I advised the Collector of Customs to desist from collecting any duties from the Rice and Corn Corporation on the rice imported so long as it was acting as the agent of the Government in meeting the emergency resulting from the rice shortage.\r\nHeretofore, Government agencies disagreeing on the interpretation of the laws affecting their powers and rights, have been allowed to bring the case before the courts for adjudication. Such a policy, I think, is wrong, and in fact in one instance it has merited the criticism of our own Supreme Court. It makes both government agencies incur in unjustified expense and unnecessarily take up the time of the courts. Considered in its practical aspect, it only means taking money from one agency of the Government and giving it to another. If it had been a question of the Government on the one hand as against a purely private enterprise on the other, then it would have been not only proper but also necessary for the courts to have intervened.\r\n\u2013Commonwealth Act No. 3, enacted also during the inaugural session of the Assembly, created the Court of Appeals in order to expedite and improve the administration of justice.\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I appointed the members of the Court who forthwith proceeded with its organization. These appointments were made after full information and careful consideration, with an eye single to the best interests of the administration of justice.\r\nAs soon as funds are available for the purpose, I shall recommend to the Assembly that the necessary appropriation be made for the creation of another division of the Court of Appeals to sit in one of the southern provinces and to authorize the various divisions of the Court of Appeals to sit in any of the provinces within their jurisdiction, to hear cases pending before the Court for decision. Such procedure would not only expedite but would also greatly reduce the cost of appeals to litigants, thus making this appellate Court more accessible to the poor.\r\n\u2013A very important measure approved by the National Assembly is Commonwealth Act No. 4 providing funds to be loaned to the Manila Railroad Company for the purchase, before maturity, of certain outstanding bonds of the said Company. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, I directed the Insular Treasurer to loan to the Manila Railroad Company P9,900,000, and authorized the Philippine National Bank to use P3,360,000 of its funds in the purchase of said bonds.\r\nOn January 29, 1936, upon payment to the Manila Railway Company (1906) Ltd., through the Chase National Bank, New York City, of the sum of $6,698,631.41 covering the principal, interest and exchange premium, all of the Souther Lines 4 per cent gold bonds maturing May 1, 1939, held by the English Company, with par value of P16,340,000, were delivered to the order of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, Washington, D.C., acting as representative of the Commonwealth Government and the Manila Railroad Company.\r\nThe successful culmination of this exceedingly important transaction resulted in great financial advantages to the direct benefit of the Manila Railroad Company and indirectly of the Commonwealth Government, which is the sole owner of the property. The following estimates indicate in round figures the savings that will be effected between now and the maturity of the bonds:\r\nThe above savings on the English Company holdings are based on the principal of the bonds being redeemed at maturity at their face value. However, both the principal and interest are subject, at the holders\u2019 option, to payment in certain European currencies at the former gold equivalent, and if this option should be exercised covering the principal at the time of maturity, the amount necessary to redeem the bonds being held by the English Company would, on the present basis of exchange, represent a total sum of approximately P27,287,800. The purchase of these new bonds at this time for the sum of P13,072,000, therefore, means a saving in interest and principal of about P14,200,000 besides a savings in interest and premium amounting to about P2,900,000 after allowing for the two per cent interest on the loan from the Government, or a total saving of about P17,100,000.\r\nThe investment of the Government in the Manila Railroad Company including bonded indebtedness of the Company all told amounts to approximately P28,000,000. This is a respectable sum for any Government and doubly so for a Government whose yearly revenue at present is around P78,000,000 and at its highest peak only reached the total of P92,783,173.70.\r\nBus and truck transportation due to improved roads in the northern and central provinces of Luzon have caused a large decline in the income of the Manila Railroad Company. We cannot afford to allow this situation to continue and permit the Government to suffer tremendous losses in railroad operation, for the time might come when the Government would either be compelled to suspend the operation of the Railway or carry a yearly financial burden that sooner or later would bankrupt the National Treasury.\r\nThe Manila Railroad was acquired by the Insular Government in 1917 in order partly to withdraw from foreign hands the control of our most important means of transportation at that time. Soon after the Government assumed the administration of this property, the railroad began paying interest on the bonds from its revenue, and even extended some of its lines with its own resources. Only during the last two or three years has the income of the railroad begun to decline due, as already stated, to bus and truck competition. If it should be found advisable, I am prepared to authorize the Manila Railroad Company to purchase some of these competing bus transportation companies or else to have the Government establish and operate its own bus and truck services. The Constitution expressly authorizes the Government to establish and operate means of transportation and communication, and, upon payment of just compensation, transfer to public ownership utilities held by private individuals to be operated by the Government.\r\nAnother step that must be taken at once is the completion of the railroad line to the Bicol provinces. This, I am informed, will make the southern lines a paying enterprise. In pursuance of the authority vested in me by law, I have directed the Secretary of Finance to purchase P3,000,000 worth of stocks of the Manila Railroad to finance the completion of the Aloneros-Ragay line. It is my understanding that to complete the road the Government will have to invest only P700,000 more in addition to the P3,000,000 referred to above.\r\nBut this amount will have to be greatly increased if the Manila Railroad Company is not given permission to abandon the Legaspi-Tabaco, Las Pinas-Naic, Rosario-Montalban and Batangas-Bauan lines which are absolutely unnecessary from the point of view of public convenience and which, consequently, are causing an annual loss of about P100,000 to the Railroad Company. Once these lines are abandoned their materials and equipment will be used in the construction of the Aloneros-Ragay line.\r\nI, therefore, earnestly recommend that a law be enacted authorizing the Manila Railroad Company to abandon the lines above mentioned.\r\n\u2013In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 5, I appointed Hon. Miguel Unson, as Chairman, and Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad and Mr. Jose Paez, as members of the Government Survey Board on February 14, 1936. The Board has been devoting considerable time to the investigation of the Government bureaus and their activities and to the formulation of a plan whereby the Government may be simplified and made more economical as well as more efficient. The most important recommendation of this Board is the creation of the Budget Office, which I have approved, and in accordance therewith I have appointed the Auditor General and the Director of Civil Service, as members of the Commission and the Honorable Serafin Marabut, former Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the National Assembly, as Undersecretary of Finance and Director of the Budget. The budget which I will soon submit to the Assembly has already been prepared by the Commission and approved by the Cabinet. The only other case in which I have exercised the authority granted me by Commonwealth Act No. 5, also upon the recommendation of the Survey Board, is the transfer of the coastguard and lighthouse service from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to the Bureau of Customs.\r\nAt this time the Board is conducting a careful investigation and study of the activities of the Bureau of Lands, General Land Registration Office, Bureaus of Public Works, Science, Animal Industry, Plant Industry and Health, and of the University of the Philippines, with the end in view of avoiding duplication and simplifying procedure. Special attention is being given by the Board to the matter of cadastral surveys, homesteads, a general registration office, a central statistics office, and proper allocation on centralization of laboratories with the purpose of recommending the intensification of industrial researches, so essential to the economic development of our country. Preliminary survey of the provincial and municipal services is likewise under way.\r\n\u2013In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 6, the Philippine National Bank has written up certain assets, heretofore considered as losses, at their actual value. On January 17, 1936, the sum of P3,940,000 was thus written up and paid to the Government, and on May 18, 1936, the sum of P2,944,997 was also written up to be paid to the Government in due course.\r\n\u2013The National Loan and Investment Board created by Commonwealth Act No. 7 has been constituted by the appointment of Mr. Salvador Lagdameo, as chairman, and of Dr. Luther B. Bewley, Mr. Jose Bernardo, and Mr. Pedro M. Moncayo, as members.\r\nThe Board began functioning on February 29, 1936, by adopting measures to organize its office and at the same time granting loans from the different funds placed under its control and administration. Due to the natural delay encountered in making the delimitation of the powers of the National Loan and Investment Board and those of the different boards and offices originally controlling the several investible funds transferred to the former, as well as in transferring the personnel and appointing the necessary new employees, the Board has not as yet been able to completely organize its office and to function as properly as it should. The amount of investible funds, the investment of which has been placed under the administration of the National Loan and Investment Board, aggregates P45,000,000 as of December 31, 1935. The actual transfer of these funds to the National Loan and Investment Board has not yet been completed. It is, however, hoped that such transfer will soon be effected.\r\nIt has been found that certain amendments to Commonwealth Act No. 7 are immediately needed in order to clarify some of its provisions.\r\n\u2013In the exercise of the powers vested in me by Commonwealth Act No. 18, I authorized the expenditure of P820,000 for the completion of the road connecting the Provinces of Lanao, Cotabato and Davao on the Island of Mindanao. As an initial step in the program of giving new impetus to the development of Mindanao, this work will be of incalculable value to the country, since it will not only provide an overland outlet for Davao but will also open to settlement immense unoccupied areas of that island.\r\nThe time has come when we should systematically proceed with and bring about the colonization and economic development of Mindanao. A vast and rich territory with its untapped natural resources is a temptation to enterprising nations that are looking for an outlet for their excess population. While no nation has the right to violate the territorial integrity of another nation, people that lack the energy, ability, or desire to make use of the resources which Divine Providence has placed in their hands, afford an excuse for a more energetic and willful people to deprive them of their lawful heritage. If, therefore, we are resolved to conserve Mindanao for ourselves and our posterity, we must bend all our efforts to occupy and develop it and guard against avarice and greed. Its colonization and development will require no little capital. But every cent spent for this purpose will mean increased national wealth and greater national security. The present income of the government is quite insufficient to even attempt to do more than carry on its present activities. Were there no other reasons for the creation of new sources of revenue, the need of developing Mindanao alone would make it an unavoidable duty for this Assembly, especially those who visited Mindanao recently with me, are conscious, I feel sure, of our grave responsibility to encourage settlement and develop Mindanao. There are provinces in Luzon and the Visayas that are already overpopulated. There are localities in some of those provinces where the people live on large estates without opportunity to earn a livelihood sufficient to meet the necessities of civilized life, much less to own the land wherein they live and which they cultivate. It is inconceivable that such a situation should exist in a country with extensive areas of fertile uncultivated lands. I invite you, therefore, to give this matter preferential consideration.\r\nThe so-called Moro problem is a thing of the past. We are giving our Mohammedan brethren the best government they have ever had and we are showing them our devoted interest in their welfare and advancement. In turn they are giving us their full cooperation. Let us reserve for them in their respective localities such land of the public domain as they may need for their well-being. Let us, at the same time, place in the unoccupied lands of that region industrious Filipinos from other provinces of the Archipelago, so that they may live together in perfect harmony and brotherhood.\r\nIn order to comply with the provisions of the Constitution concerning public education I feel it my duty to see to it that a careful study be made of the fundamental problems brought about by the conditions now obtaining so that our educational policies and objectives may be re-defined. Our system of public education must be inspired in Filipino patriotism and consecrated to the formation of citizens of high moral character and civic virtues. It must equip our citizens with social and vocational efficiency not only for their own benefit but also so that they may the better serve the State. We must provide every child of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction.\r\nSo that the Government may be advised as to the best method and the necessary means to carry out the reorganization and proper orientation of our public school system, I have created, by executive order, the Council of Education, composed of professional educators drawn from our own Bureau of Education and the Government University as well as from some of the best accredited private institutions of learning. Dr. Rafael Palma, former President of the University of the Philippines, is at the head of the Council. The members are: Hon. Gabriel Manalac, Dr. Francisco Benitez, Dr. Jorge Bocobo, Dr. Luther Bewley, Hon. Norberto Romualdez, Mrs. Sofia R. de Veyra, Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Dr. Manuel L. Carreon, and Mr. Segundo Infantado. I hope that during the present sessions some recommendations of the Council may be submitted to you for appropriate action.\r\nDuring the last especial session I recommended the enactment of legislation that will make our Civil Service Law conform to the provisions of the Constitution. Lack of time prevented you from taking affirmative action on this subject, and I hereby renew my former recommendation.\r\nWhile it is my hope and conviction that the English language will remain one of the most generally spoken languages in the Philippines even after independence, nevertheless, we cannot ignore the injunction of the Constitution that we take steps for the formation of a national language based on one of the existing native languages. It is difficult to determine what practical measures may be adopted at this time to bring this about, but I wish to lay the problem before you so that you may give it your early and deliberate consideration. Perhaps a committee may be created to study the question and make recommendations.\r\nIn view of the new and greater responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the necessity of having at our disposal funds with which to carry out a comprehensive program for the economic development of the country, it will be necessary to create new taxes. The following are some of the tax measures which I recommend for your approval:\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment of the Income Tax Law by reducing the personal tax exemption and increasing the rate of the tax on excess personal income and of the tax on corporate profits.\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment of the Inheritance Tax Law by increasing the rate of the tax, particularly in the case of estates of decedents not leaving any forced heirs.\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 The increase of the tax on mines.\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Taxes on luxuries and amusements.\r\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 The creation of a school tax in an amount equal to the present cedula tax, which should be abolished.\r\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 A tax on transportation and travel in an amount sufficient to take care of the maintenance and improvement of roads.\r\n7.\u00a0\u00a0 A modification of the Land Tax Law, so as to provide for a progressively increasing rate of taxation based upon the area of the landholdings.\r\n8.\u00a0\u00a0 Modifications of present tax laws to enable the Government to collect taxes more effectively.\r\nThe taxes I am recommending place the burden upon shoulders that can well afford to bear them and, if levied, the Commonwealth Government will be able to render our people new services so urgently needed for their welfare and progress. I feel confident that those who are called upon to pay these taxes will not grudge their added contribution to the public weal.\r\nUntil the National Assembly enacts the measure above referred to, it will be futile for me to present for your consideration a program of government activities or industrial development which the Government may initiate or help in part, for there will be no means with which to carry it out.\r\nFrom time to time, during your present session, I shall have occasion to present for your study and consideration matters that, in my opinion, deserve your attention. Meanwhile, may I express the hope that the cordial cooperation which as existed in the last session between the Executive and the Legislative Departments will continue to be keynote of our relations? The success of the Commonwealth will depend upon the ability of the executive and legislative departments to cooperate with each other.\r\nIn our day and generation democracy, as an effective system of government, is being challenged. Let this new democracy of ours show to the world that democracy can be as efficient as a dictatorship, without trespassing upon individual liberty and the sacred rights of the people.", "title": "On the Country\u2019s Conditions and Problems"},

SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:\r\nWe are at the half-way mark of our tenure. It is time, I believe, to restate the basic philosophy of our Administration.\r\nWhen our term began, I announced that the happiness and security of the common man would be foremost among our goals. With material help we would enable him to achieve self-competence, prosperity, and contentment. With spiritual guidance we would foster in him a wholesome attitude toward work, toward his Government, and toward his fellowmen.\r\nLet me emphasize at this point that my concern for the common man is not merely sentimental or emotional. It is a hard fact that a nation cannot survive without the safe foundation of a prosperous and contented majority of its citizens.\r\nWe believe that what is good for the common man is good for the whole country. Every policy of our Administration has therefore been directed to his welfare. We have anchored our national destiny to the common man.\r\nIn this endeavor we have addressed ourselves, first of all, to the task of rural development. In the rural areas lies the bulk of our natural and human resources, the real wealth of our nation. We must gear them to each other and spark the latter into action so as to achieve expanding production to meet the requirements of national prosperity and security.\r\nOur accomplishments in the rural areas constitute, I believe, the most concrete achievement of this Administration. We have gone a long way in giving our rural inhabitants the material means to prosperity and improvement.\r\nForemost of these is land.\r\nDuring the last special session you enacted Republic Act No. 1400, known as the Land Tenure Reform Law. The Administration established by this law has taken the first steps to acquire landed estates for redistribution.\r\nThe NARRA continued to do a commendable job of resettling families in public lands. During the year 1955 it distributed homesteads to eight thousand eight hundred families in 22 settlement projects.\r\nIt is prepared henceforth to resettle at lest twelve thousand families a year. The flow of voluntary settlers in public lands also increased last year as a result of the accelerated surveys being undertaken by the Bureau of Lands.\r\nBut land alone is not enough. We are also building barrio roads\r\nand irrigation systems\r\nand placing agricultural experts at the service of our farmers and settlers. In this way they learn scientific agriculture, obtain indispensable water to expand the productivity of the land, and gain easy access to markets for their produce. At the same time new areas are opened up for cultivation.\r\nThe fast spreading ACCFA movement has continued to free more and more of our small farmers from exploitation.\r\nACCFA loans, which last year amounted to thirty-eight million four hundred thousand pesos,\r\nhave enabled FACOMA members to buy and own their carabaos\r\nas well as farm equipment and supplies. Through the extension of FACOMA marketing facilities, small farmers are receiving more money for their products. The increase in the total income of farmers-members last year alone is estimated at more than eighty million pesos.\r\nDefinitely, the ACCFA points the way to rural stability and progress. We must continue to give it determined support.\r\nThe credit needs of our small farmers are being met from others sources.\r\nLast year the Philippine National Bank, the RFC, and the rural banks extended loans to more farmer borrowers. It is, however, necessary to continue expanding credit for rural development.\r\nThe improvement of health in the rural areas is another tangible achievement. Many more towns and barrios are now assured of potable water from artesian wells\r\nand water systems.\r\nMobile health units, now numbering over one thousand, performed more than ten million work units\r\nin a three-month period of operation alone during 1955, providing medical services varying from simple consultations to child delivery and reaching places where no medical service had ever been available before. The complete eradication of malaria within the next three years is now within sight.\r\nComprehensive as are the material services and benefits extended to our rural inhabitants, this Administration has paralleled them with mental and spiritual stimulation. In this work we have made full use of education in all its aspects.\r\nBarrio schools are increasing.\r\nIn them children are acquiring not only the basic tools of knowledge but also the skills of hand that can lead to a more abundant life.\r\nMainly to benefit rural children, who can afford no more than a few years of schooling, a revolutionary experiment is being introduced. Instead of English, the local dialects are now being used in the first two years of the elementary in many school divisions. Further result will, however, bear careful evaluation before the change may be universally adopted.\r\nWith encouragement from the Government, civic-spirited private organizations are helping to educate our people. Among these are the agricultural councils. The barrio assemblies, the 4-H clubs, and the\r\nassociations.\r\nThe establishment of barrio councils pursuant to Republic Act No. 1408 is another stride toward the strengthening of democracy at the grassroots. It is a good beginning but needs additional means of implementation to give it substance and practical effect. With these new organs of self-expression and self-government, our barrio people will display more initiative in improving their respective communities.\r\nBut unless Godliness and morality suffuse the outlook of our people, no objective achieved will be truly satisfying and enduring. We have therefore continued to emphasize the development of these attributes in the character of our youth as one of the fundamental objectives of our educational system.\r\nWhile we have concentrated on rural development as our first and most important task, we have also endeavored to help the common man along other lines.\r\nUnder the Administration, labor has gained in stature with its greater participation in public affairs. In matters affecting labor itself, we have not hesitated to seek directly the counsel of its spokesmen, and its representatives now sit in the National Economic Council. The National Board of Education, the boards of various government corporations, and the Labor-Management Advisory Council of the Department of Labor.\r\nThe healthy growth of trade unions continues, while the workers\u2019 increasing awareness of their rights and responsibilities is being matched by an expanding labor service on the part of the Government.\r\nThe time has arrived for us to make a start on extending to labor the benefits of a social security system. However, we have had to delay the implementation of the Social Security Act because of our desire to assure the success of such a system by building it on a stable foundation rather than risk failure through a hasty start.\r\nI recommend that the Congress give careful consideration to the review of the law, so that we may soon begin to establish a sound security system.\r\nWe have always recognized the necessity of providing low-cost housing for our working people. While financial difficulties have retarded our efforts to this end, we have embarked on various housing programs. The People\u2019s Homesite and Housing Corporation is expanding low-rental housing for urban workers and the Home Financing Commission is ready to undertake aided self-help housing in the small communities, as well as private housing under a system of insured mortgages.\r\nAcknowledging their invaluable services to our people, we have provided for the adjustment of the salaries of the thousands of teachers who are themselves part of the low income group we seek to help, as well as active participants in the work of that group\u2019s uplift.\r\nOur Government\u2019s deep concern for the common man is the logical first step toward imbuing the Filipino way of life with the true substance of democracy. Our people must be assisted to the richer rewards of effort but, at the same time, shown that those rewards are won through hard work and integrity. We must nurture in them self-respect, self-reliance, competence, and an ever awake social conscience-qualities that we must develop first of all at the base, as the foundation of the solidarity and greatness of our nation. In our striving for fulfillment as a people, we believe in working from the ground up\u2014in the factories, in the\r\n, in the\r\n, in the towns of our rural areas\u2014in the conviction that genuine democracy moves upward and not downward.\r\nOn the overall level, the national welfare has also advanced.\r\nWe have strengthened our friendship with other free countries. In the Bandung Conference, we forged closer ties with Asian and African nations and effectively collaborated with them in achieving unity. In the United Nations we secured Asian representation and membership in the Security Council, although incompletely, by splitting a two-year term with Yugoslovia. We have continued to promote international understanding through various international conferences, some of which were held in our country.\r\nContinuing our fruitful collaboration with the United States, we have made good use of American economic aid in developing some of the activities I have already described. Under our mutual defense treaty with the United States and the Manila Pact, we have further strengthened the national security.\r\nOn the domestic front, peace and order are at their highest peak in postwar years. All but a few areas have been liberated from the terror of banditry and the Communist-led uprising.\r\nHowever, against the backdrop of the new Communist diplomatic and economic offensive that has brought the \u201ccold war\u201d to a new crisis. Alien agents and saboteurs have attempted new and direct penetration and subversion. But, alert to their inroads, we have swiftly tracked them down and are prepared to meet every further outbreak of this new peril with vigor and firmness.\r\nThe year\u2019s end witnessed an important turning point in our national economy. The era of free trade with the United States came to a close, and new graduated tariff duties were imposed on American imports. With this and other basic changes in our trade relations with the United States we can now lay the basis for a stable economy. It is now up to us to build that economy with determination and dedication.\r\nThe national production, estimated at eight billion eight hundred million pesos, increased by nearly four percent over that of last year. This was due to some progress in industrialization and a slight increase in agricultural production.\r\nLarge outlays for public works and development projects and additional public investments through government-owned corporations\r\nmade some contribution to the increase. Significant production gains have been made in some manufacturing lines.\r\nI must state, however, that this increase in national production hardly evinces a balanced growth pattern. There is imperative need for the coordination and more vigorous implementation of the Government\u2019s policies and the intensification of our efforts to stimulate production.\r\nAn integrated credit pattern is shaping up. The public and private banking institutions are gradually developing a balanced pattern of commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans. A good start has been made in giving special credit support to long-range development projects. The flow of credit should, however, be channeled so as to follow still more closely the main direction of our economic plans.\r\nWe have effected field surveys and investigation of our mineral deposits, the location of underground waters for both irrigation and potable water supply, and the survey and delineation of additional fishery areas and forest lands that may be made available for commercial exploitation. All these are intended to expand the utilization of our abundant natural resources. It is our hope that these resources surveys and investigations will make private enterprises fully aware of our potentialities and induce them to participate in our country\u2019s development.\r\nDuring the first ten months of the year 1955, rising local production, coupled with controls over non-essential imports, brought prices and the cost of living to record low levels since 1952.\r\nHowever, mainly because of speculation in anticipation of new tariffs on American imports as well as the new tariff schedules and the expecting tightening of exchange controls, prices began to rise toward the end of the year and the trend still continues. The hoarding of imported stocks has become evident. It is equally evident that the rise in the prices of many articles of commerce, including basic necessities, not affected or only slightly affected by the new tariffs, is artificial and unjustified.\r\nI recommend that the Congress consider means to prevent the spiraling of prices of essential commodities, either by a well-studied price control system or other effective measures. In the meanwhile, the Executive Department will use all the means at its command, including NAMARCO\u2019s merchandising operations, to hold prices in line.\r\nI would like to express here our appreciation of the cooperation that civic-spirited business organizations and individuals have preferred to the Government in this endeavor.\r\nAnother problem that looms large in our mind is unemployment. Its causes are numerous and complex, but this is not the occasion to consider them in detail.\r\nNevertheless, I take note of this serious problem to underscore its urgency and to emphasize upon all our people, particularly those in business and in the Government, the need for devoting all our energies, all our intelligence, all our zeal to the task of providing and creating opportunities for our people to make a decent living. The guideposts which I shall presently outline contain specific measures to meet this difficulty.\r\nIn brief outline, this is the record of the year past. It tells us that while something has been done. Our responsibility is not yet fully fulfilled. But this I know: We have hit our stride. We can and will succeed.\r\nOur people have begun the peaceful revolution of uprooting age-old injustices and social evils and of elevating themselves to their true worth and dignity.\r\nWe must preserve and consolidate our gains and accelerate our forward pace.\r\nI wish to emphasize that there is no change in our approach to the country\u2019s problems. There is no departure from our basic economic objectives and policies which in past year I outlined to you.\r\nSo that our partnership in national duty and responsibility may produce increasing results, I invite you, as you perform your important share of our common task, to keep the following guideposts in view:\r\nBlessed with vast expanses of fertile land, we have the basic means to stop the recurring food shortages. We must attain self-sufficiency at least in the basic food.\r\nFortunately, we have succeeded in developing some effective incentives to production, such as the maintenance of floor prices in rice and corn and the expansion of credit and marketing facilities. We should now consider the feasibility of extending these incentives to other essential foods.\r\nTo sustain our gains, I have directed the NARIC, the ACCFA, and other agencies concerned to coordinate their efforts with the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources toward the early attainment of self-sufficiency in food.\r\nBecause land ownership remains the greatest incentive to productivity and contentment among our masses, we are speeding up land distribution. The salutary impact of the Land Tenure Reform Act will soon be added to the efforts of the NARRA, the ACCFA, and the Bureau of Lands.\r\nI invite the Congress to continue its interest in land reform and devise other means of further intensifying our efforts along this line.\r\nAs we diversify our efforts to stimulate community development, the establishment of a coordinating and implementing machinery becomes more urgent. I recommend that the Congress consider the creation of such an instrumentality to undertake this task.\r\nI suggest that the Congress consider measures to make the local governments financially self-sufficient and more effective in community development. If deemed necessary, an organization should be created to undertake studies on this matter.\r\nOur main hope of providing more employment to our people lies in the fuller utilization of our abundant natural resources. It is essential that existing as well as new industries make greater use of our available raw materials and develop those that can be produced locally. We should, therefore, give continued emphasis to industries and enterprises that will utilize more of our available materials and resources, as against those which are largely dependent on imported raw materials. Unless this is done, it will be well nigh impossible to build a sound economy.\r\nTo promote this objective, I recommend that the Congress provide funds for the continuance and expansion of our resources surveys and investigations.\r\nThe expansion of credit facilities coupled with the proper allocation of foreign exchange is an effective stimulus to agricultural and industrial production. There should now be developed an integrated system of economic priorities to govern the extension of credit and the allocation of dollars. I have, therefore, directed the National Economic Council to develop such a system in concert with the Central Bank, giving preference to projects and enterprises which will make greater use of our available resources and which have high-income and employment potential.\r\nI have directed the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation and the Central Bank to coordinate their activities and expedite the granting of loans and foreign exchange allocations to qualified agricultural and industrial enterprises.\r\nI have also directed the Philippine National bank and, through the Central Bank, the rural banks all over the country to re-examine their lending operations with a view to giving greater support to small merchants and producers.\r\nWe must revitalize our educational system with emphasize on general, scientific, and vocational education.\r\nThe proposal to have an undersecretary for vocational education merits careful study. We should give full support to the improvement of instruction and facilities in public agricultural, trade, and technical schools.\r\nThe decreasing emphasis on the natural and physical sciences runs counter to the rapidly developing era of electronics and atomics. If we are to participate fully in the blessings of science, we must recast our educational system tot rain more engineers and scientists. As a beginning, mathematics and physics should again be taught as compulsory in high schools.\r\nFundamental and applied research has long been neglected. In science and scholarship we have largely depended on progress abroad. It is time that we participate seriously in this enterprise, paying particular attention to our needs.\r\nAs one of the first steps, I have created a Science Advisory Committee composed of representatives of the principal scientific organizations.\r\nI urge the Congress to provide more funds for scientific research and investigation. I suggest that an appropriation be set aside for this purpose.\r\nIt would also be desirable to establish an Institute of Economic Development and Research in the University of the Philippines to provide not only our students but also those neighboring Asian countries with the advanced training essential to accelerated development.\r\nWe should provide inducements for private philanthropy for the benefit of scientific research. One way of doing this is to adopt a far-sighted tax policy in donations and grants for scientific research and investigation.\r\nThe insufficiency and timidity of capital, domestic and foreign, has been one of the principal reasons for the delay in our economic development. We should now dissipate the uncertainty in our investment atmosphere and, consistent with the national interest, give to investors the necessary incentives and guarantees.\r\nI trust that the Congress will enact in this session legislation fully meeting this problem.\r\nIt is part of our efforts to clarify the goals of our economic growth and the means with which we seek to attain them. Among them ate the economic controls. While we are for their gradual removal, they remain necessary at this stage of our economic development. They must be utilized to assure the most advantageous allocation of our limited resources and thus maintain monetary and price stability.\r\nImprovements must be effected in the implementation of controls. But sudden policy changes which tend to dislocate business should be avoided.\r\nI urge the Congress to consider amendments to the Central Bank Charter which would render the Monetary Board more effective in the administration of exchange and the management of money and credit.\r\nIn this connection, I would urge that at least three of the members of the Monetary Board serve on a full time basis.\r\nThe Central Bank Charter should be amended further to provide for a more liberal rediscounting system so as to enlarge the lending operations of our banks.\r\nWe should re-examine the no-dollar import law, define its objectives and scope, and examine its performance in the light of experience to date.\r\nOur tariff structure should be further studied to give full protection to our vital industries. It would also be advisable to renew the authority granted to the President under Republic Act No. 1196 to increase or reduce tariff rates for at least two more years.\r\nAt the bottom of our slow progress in some areas of public service is the insufficiency of public revenues. I therefore urge the Congress to study the following aspects of our fiscal organization with a view to increasing government revenues:\r\nFirst, the necessity of setting up a tax commission to undertake technical studies of our tax system and recommend improvements;\r\nSecond, the further raising of the efficiency of our revenue collecting agencies; and,\r\nThird, the revision of our tax laws where such revisions are deemed urgent, pending the studies by the tax commission.\r\nI shall presently submit to you a report which the Tax Advisory Board has just completed for your consideration.\r\nThe implementation of sound and well-planned projects often bogs down owing to inefficiency in public administration. We must, therefore, continue to buttress our administrative units, especially those directly concerned with economic development.\r\nWe have completed the wage and position classification survey and a project on the improvement of budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures in the Government. We should now apply the results of these studies to effect economy and efficiency.\r\nOur initial experience in performance budgeting in twelve government bureaus has produced beneficial results. We should now extend it to more government agencies.\r\nThe most inspiring laws and the best-conceived plans of implementing them are often frustrated by administrative inertia and incompetence.\r\nRealizing this I have created a Presidential Performance Commission and entrusted it with the duty of keeping close watch on performance and result in the executive agencies and instrumentalities of the Government. Energetic, intelligent, and dedicated service at every level is indispensable to the success of Government.\r\nI commend these guideposts to your thoughtful consideration in the full confidence that they will give our joint efforts a common unswerving direction.\r\nIn our task, I call upon our people to continue giving us their earnest support. This is their share of responsibility implicit in their twice-entrusted mandate under which we assumed the nation\u2019s leadership.\r\nOur times demand selflessness and self-sacrifice. The insincere, the dishonest, the selfish, the greedy, the laggard have no place.\r\nWith God continuing His kind blessings upon us, we shall not be found wanting.\r\nIn 1955, the NARRA also facilitated the issuance of 3,600 land titles to its settlers.\r\nThe number of patents approved by the Bureau of Lands reached 33,075 in 1955 as against 28,409 in 1954 and 15,063 in 1952. The number of agricultural lots distributed to landless applicants in 1955 was 23,578 as against 18,842 in 1954. There were also 401, 425 hectares of land surveyed in 1955 as against 456,000 hectares in 1954.\r\nIn 1955, 565 kilometers of new roads were opened to traffic as against 252 kilometers in 1954. The length of roads improved and paved reached 1,194 kilometers in 1955 as compared to 485 kilometers in 1954, while the length of 83 bridge projects completed in 1955 reached 2,890 lineal meters as against 23 bridge projects completed in 1954 with a total length of 1,223 lineal meters.\r\nThe number of national and communal irrigation projects completed reached 143. Forty are under construction, out of a total of 183 planned in 1955, serving an irrigable area of 60, 114 hectares, as against nine projects completed in 1954, serving a total area of 16,200 hectares. There were also 30 irrigation pumps installed in 1955 covering as area of 7,386 hectares.\r\nIn 1955, 90 additional cooperative marketing associations were organized, with a total membership of 85,000 farmers and total paid-up capitalization of P1.6 million. By December 31, 1955, a total of 319 FACOMAs were operating, with a total membership of 188,000 farmers located in 7,759 barrios scattered over 42 provinces with a total paid-up capital of nearly P3 million.\r\nTotal loans to the farmer-members through their FACOMAs amounted to P15.6 million in the previous year. By the end of 1955, total loans to the co-ops and their members reached P56.8 million P8.8 million of which enabled 33,368 farmers to purchase their own carabaos, farm tools, and equipment and supplies.\r\nThe number of carabaos has increased by about 340,000 from 1954 to 1955.\r\nTotal loans granted by the banking system in 1955 amounted to P436.4 million for all types of loans, showing an increase of 8.7 per cent over those granted in 1954. Loans granted for commercial purposes increased by 10.7 per cent.; those for industrial purposes, by 4.7 per cent; while for agricultural purposes dropped by 8.3 per cent.\r\nIn 1955, 1,610 artesian wells were completed as against 1,216 in 1954, making a total of 2,826 wells in the last two years.\r\nThere were 150 spring development projects completed and 51 new waterworks installed in 1955 as against 25 and seven, respectively, in 1954.\r\nHealth work unit refers to work load or service performed by personnel or Rural Health Units, each of which is composed of a physician, a nurse, a midwife, and a sanitary inspector, consisting of consultation, examination, treatment, immunization, inspection, health education, deliveries, operations, etc.\r\nIn 1195, there were 4,676 school buildings in various stages of completion, including 1,390 pre-fabricated school houses.\r\nDuring the year, 25,613\r\norganizations were formed, bringing the total to 70,743, with a total of membership of about five million members.\r\nTen regional offices were established to meet the need for more efficient labor services in the provinces.\r\nConstruction of low-cost housing by the People\u2019s Homesite and Housing Corporation was continued in Quezon City. Plans have been prepared to construct low-cost housing unit in other areas like Tondo, Sta. Ana. Tagaytay, Baguio, Tacloban, Iloilo, Cebu and Davao.\r\nCommanders Sol and Villapando were killed; Kamlon surrendered.\r\nTotal agricultural production in 1955 increased by 57,400 metric tons over that of 1954, with rice production increasing by less than one percent. Export crop production dropped by 0.2 percent, with copra production increasing by 2.3 percent and sugar production decreasing by 2.6 percent.\r\nThe government-owned corporations increased their investment in productive enterprises by P28.4 million in 1955 over that of the previous year.\r\nThe consumers price index of the Central Bank (1949 = 100) continued to drop from an average of 104.4 in 1952 to 100.9 in 1953, 99.4 in 1954, and 98.1 for the first nine months of 1955.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},

There was bitter dissension and defeatism.\u00a0 Our people had lost faith in their institutions and in themselves.\r\nToday, there is a new spirit of confidence in our land.\r\nIf this Administration can claim any outstanding achievement during the past year, it is the restoration of national self-respect and the revival of the people\u2019s faith in the democratic way of life. Our people and their Government are now as one, jointly engaged in the grand enterprise of securing for this country the fullness of freedom and prosperity.\r\nIn this vital transformation, the role of this Administration has been a modest one.\u00a0 We have done no more than to activate the resurgence of national self-confidence and to establish the essential conditions for its constructive expression.\u00a0 If achievements there have been, they have been possible because our people wanted them and worked to bring them about.\r\nIn the world at large, the collective strength of the free nations increased sufficiently to deter overt acts of aggression.\u00a0 Thanks to the free\u00a0 world\u2019s\u00a0 readiness to defend the peace, the danger of an atomic war is now less imminent.\r\nBut grave dangers still remain.\u00a0 Communist imperialism has not renounced its objective of world domination.\u00a0 It is still actively promoting subversion within the free nations.\r\nEven as we meet here, the Tachen islands, only a few hundred miles to the north of us, are aflame under new Communist attacks.\u00a0 We must remain on guard.\r\nIt is against this background that I should like to consider with you today the state of the nation.\r\nWe have made positive in the strengthening of the national security.\r\nIn the discharge of this basic responsibility, we have sought, first of all the effective implementation by the United States of her commitments under the Philippine-American Mutual Defense Treaty, upon which we must rely principally for our external defense.\u00a0 America has responded with a categorical commitment of immediate assistance to our country in case of attack; and a permanent Philippine-American Council has been created for the effective implementation of the treaty.\r\nActually, the United States military bases we now have here are America\u2019s earnest to us of automatic retaliation to aggression.\r\nOur participation in the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, now know as the Manila Pact, has further enhanced our nation\u2019s security.\u00a0 As the first regional collective defense agreement in our part of the world, this Pact extends the collective security system envisaged by the United Nations Charter.\r\nThus, by every possible defense arrangement\u2014bilateral, regional, and international\u2014we have strengthened our external defense.\r\nOur internal security has improved.\u00a0\u00a0 The alertness of the Armed Forces brought about the surrender of Luis Taruc and the death of Mariano Balgos, two of the top Communists in the Philippines.\u00a0 Still other Huk leaders and followers have surrendered or have been either killed or captured.\u00a0 Many Huk-infested areas have been cleared and put back to productive use.\r\nI must say here that these successes in the restoration of public order would not have been possible without the loyal support and cooperation of the civilian population.\r\nAll this notwithstanding, I must repeat my warning against complacency.\u00a0 We must continue to be alert to the dangers of Communist aggression and subversion.\u00a0 Our gains in the restoration of peace in our countrysides must be consolidated.\u00a0 Our armed forces must continue to protect our farmers and their homes.\u00a0 We cannot as yet afford to lessen either our vigilance or our armed strength.\r\nBut there is more to national security than simply maintaining territorial integrity and public order.\u00a0 To be really secure, a country must assure for its citizens the social and economic conditions that would enable them to live in decency, free from ignorance, disease, and want.\r\nToday, a concerted effort is being exerted to bring about these conditions in our rural areas.\u00a0 Varied elements of our society\u2014the Government, the youth, civic-spirited individuals and organizations, the rural people themselves\u2014all are engaged in the great undertaking of bringing freedom and progress to our barrios.\r\nWe are approaching the problem along three main lines:\r\nFirst, improvement of our land tenure system, supplemented by land resettlement:\r\nSecond, more effective aid to tenants and small farmers in the form of (a) credit on easy terms; (b) essential facilities, such as water and roads; and (c) technical advice on how to improve farm operations; and\r\nThird, more intensive community development with emphasis on self-help.\r\nThe first approach, land reform, gained headway with the approval of the Agricultural Tenancy Act last year.\u00a0 This law extends greater protection to tenants.\u00a0 More important still, it grants them the option to choose the system of tenancy under which they would prefer to work.\u00a0 By choosing the leasehold system, a tenant, of his own free will, takes an important step towards economic independence.\r\nTo implement the Act, we have established the Agricultural Tenancy Commission.\u00a0 In the short time that it has functioned, this Commission has already proved effective in assisting tenants in the exercise of their rights.\u00a0\u00a0 I would recommend, therefore that Congress provide it with needed funds.\r\nHowever, it is not enough to provide tenants with this type of assistance.\u00a0 It is equally necessary that tenancy disputes be settled with dispatch.\u00a0 Hence, I would reiterate my recommendation for the creation of a Court of Agrarian Relations.\r\nAnother essential measure in land reform is the purchase or expropriation of large estates and their distribution to their occupants and to landless workers.\u00a0 Mainly owing to lack of funds, we have been unable to implement this measure to any large extent.\u00a0 I would urge Congress to consider anew ways and means to carry out the redistribution of large estates.\r\nWe have however, distributed public lands to landless workers at a fast rate.\u00a0 Last year, the Bureau of Lands issued to qualified settlers 28,000 land patents, covering 241,000 hectares.\u00a0 Compared to the 10,000 land patents issued in 1953 and the 3,000 issued in 1952, last year\u2019s total constitutes a record.\r\nNevertheless we must accelerate our pace.\u00a0 Our people, on their own initiative, are moving to public lands opened and subsided for settlement.\u00a0 This is indicated by the fact that during the last year 33,000 applications for agricultural lands were filed by independent settlers.\r\nFor others who, due to poverty, are unable to proceed to settlement areas by themselves, the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) has opened several settlement projects. NARRA assists families to move from congested rural areas to these projects, providing them with farm implements, transportation, subsistence up to the first crop, and other forms of aid.\r\nUnder this Administration, NARRA moved 2,882 settler families from crowded rural areas to about 27,000 hectares of public land.\u00a0 In addition, it allocated 10,000 hectares of public land to 1,718 landless families who pioneered in the settlement areas, and helped them in the survey of their clearings and in the acquisition of land titles.\u00a0 NARRA spent during the year under review P1.3 million of which 77 per cent went as direct aid to the settlers.\u00a0 I would recommend that Congress appropriate the funds already authorized by it for NARRA.\r\nOur second approach consists in assisting the poor farmer get on his feet.\r\nIn most cases, the vicious circle of inadequate production and insufficient credit has kept him in dire property.\u00a0 The Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA) has begun to break that circle by making available to small farmers credit on easy terms.\r\nAt the same time, ACCFA helps them in setting up marketing and warehousing facilities, through their own cooperatives.\r\nDuring the last year, ACCFA greatly intensified its aid to farmers.\u00a0 As of December 31, 1954, it had released a total of 18.9 million pesos in loans of various types of farmers.\u00a0 It had organized 232 Farmers Cooperative Marketing Associations (FACOMAS) in Central and Northern Luzon and Cotabato, with a total membership of 105,943 farmers.\r\nACCFA\u2019s operations are still in their initial phase.\u00a0 They have covered only 2,375 of our 18,000 barrios.\u00a0 Yet, they already count with the enthusiastic support of our people.\r\nOne very encouraging aspect of ACCFA\u2019s operations is that the small farmers pay their crop loans on time.\u00a0 In the past, crop loans were seldom, if ever, paid.\u00a0 Under this Administration, there has been an important change of attitude on the part of our farmers.\u00a0 This healthy trend proves once more that it is sound business to invest in the people\u2019s welfare.\r\nClearly, ACCFA should expand its operations.\u00a0 I would recommend that Congress increase its capital.\r\nThe Farmer\u2019s pressing need for irrigation is gradually being met with our irrigation construction program, which we started to carry out vigorously during the past year.\r\nFour irrigation projects financed by public works funds, covering a total area of 9,000 hectares, have been completed or are nearing completion.\u00a0 PHILCUSA-FOA funds have financed one completed project in Nueva Ecija; another in Iloilo now nearing completion; and still another in Isabela to be completed before the end of this year\u2014covering a total area of 42,100 hectares.\r\nIn addition, we have started work on seven irrigation projects\u2014the Agno River project in Pangasinan; the Sta. Cruz and Mabacan River projects in Laguna; the Daet\u00a0 River project in Camarines Norte; the Agos River project in Quezon Province; the Pa\u00f1giplan River project in Negros Occidental; and the Suague River project in Iloilo.\u00a0 These projects covering about 40,000 hectares and estimated to cost P22 million, are being financed from bond issues.\r\nAnother essential feature of this program is the development of communal irrigation systems.\u00a0 An expenditure of P957,254.40 was incurred for the construction of 90 communal irrigation systems in 27 provinces.\r\nI have also earmarked one million pesos from the Contingent Fund for the purchase of cement which the Government will contribute for the construction of permanent communal irrigation systems to be built primarily by the barrio people themselves, who, for their part, will contribute labor, sand, and gravel.\u00a0 Farmers from Nueva Vizcaya and La Union were the first to avail themselves of this joint venture between the people and their Government.\r\nWherever feasible, the gravity irrigation systems are now being supplemented by pump irrigation facilities.\r\nTo speed up the implementation of our irrigation construction program, existing administrative and financing policies on water utilization and water rights should be re-examined.\r\nTo provide potable water, more than 1,300 artesian wells have been completed to date in the barrios at a cost of 3.5 million pesos.\u00a0 This means that we have installed an average of four artesian wells each working day.\u00a0 Compared with the total of 153 artesian wells installed in 1952 and 256 in 1953, this constitutes a great improvement.\u00a0 This year, as we get additional drilling equipment, we expect to better this record.\r\nWhile on this subject, I would like to commend the splendid cooperation of organizations and individuals, led by the Liberty Wells Association, in the Government\u2019s artesian wells program.\r\nFifteen waterworks projects costing 2.5 million pesos have been completed.\u00a0 Forty more, with an estimated total cost of 25.5 million pesos, will be constructed within the year.\u00a0 Work is now going on in over 80 spring development projects which will benefit about 90,000 people.\r\nNext to water, road facilities are essential in improving the farmer\u2019s lot.\u00a0 This brings us to the Administration\u2019s highway and feeder road program.\r\nDuring the past year, we have constructed about 430 kilometers of feeder roads serving about 80 communities and opening new areas.\u00a0 In Mindanao, we have started the construction of 235 kilometers of roads which, when completed, will open large areas of agricultural, forests, and mineral lands, and connect the coastal with the inland towns.\r\nAbout 479 kilometers of roads were also improved in various parts of the country, of which 82 kilometers of asphalt and concrete pavement were completed.\u00a0 The improvement of the interprovincial network was started on 90 projects covering a total of 385 kilometers of concrete paving and 182 kilometers of asphalt and 29 permanent bridges.\r\nAside from the foregoing, which were financed or are being financed from the Highway Fund, we have also started construction on 19 road projects and eight bridge projects, with an estimated cost of 20 million pesos, to be financed by funds from bond issues.\r\nDuring the first year of the program, much of the work consisted in developing practical and efficient operating methods better planning and allocation of funds, and the organization of equipment depots and maintenance crews.\u00a0 This year we expect the program to gain momentum.\r\nWe propose to concentrate our work primarily on feeder roads to reach our long-isolated barrios.\u00a0 Considering our lack of funds and the enthusiasm of our rural people, I would suggest that Congress approve the necessary legislation authorizing the construction of feeder roads on a self-help basis.\u00a0 The Government shall provide the funds, know-how and equipment; and the people, their labor and locally available materials.\r\nThe yield of our farming not enough to support our small farmers.\u00a0 They are eager to produce more, but they know only antiquated farming methods.\u00a0\u00a0 To help them, the Government is providing throughout the country technical advice on improved farming methods, through the agricultural extension service and other agencies.\u00a0 Better breeds of animals and high-yielding varieties of rice have been introduced.\u00a0 Soil classification and analysis have been extended to many areas, largely through the untiring efforts of the field men.\u00a0\u00a0 Special mention should be made of the Margate system of rice culture as a direct means for improving the rice yield.\u00a0\u00a0 It is now being introduced all over the country.\r\nAs we help our people become better farmers, we also encourage them to make their barrios better places to live in.\u00a0 We tell them that the Government cannot do everything for them, that they must also help themselves.\r\nTheir response has been most heartening.\u00a0 The spirit of self-help is sweeping our rural communities.\u00a0 Here again, the role of the Government is simply to tap the creative energies of our people and to provide the means by which their desire for improvement can be translated into permanent benefits.\r\nIt is for this purpose that our health, education, and social welfare programs are being re-oriented with emphasis on self-help.\r\nIn the campaign to control and eventually eliminate mass diseases, the active cooperation of our people is being enlisted.\u00a0 Our aim is to increase the effectiveness of the campaign and to make its effects more lasting.\u00a0 The approach has been especially useful in the successful BCG vaccination and malaria control campaigns.\u00a0 More than 1,000 rural health units have been established as a joint venture of the national and local governments, with FOA assistance.\r\nThe pre-fabricated schoolhouses now being mass produced will be set up in the barrios, also on a self-help basis, with the people providing the labor. We expect the steady flow of these schoolhouses to our barrios to start by next month.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the emphasis on vocational education is being increased and the community school movement, using the methods of grass-roots democracy, is being extended throughout the country.\r\nThe Social Welfare Administration has expanded its services to the rural areas and is taking an active part in community self-help projects. This is being done in accordance with a planned shift from relief to self-help activities.\u00a0 At the same time, it has carried on more effective disaster relief operations and maintained essential welfare and rehabilitation services.\r\nThese varied social measures\u2014for better health, wider opportunities for education, and more gainful employment-are now being carried out, with the use of more efficient techniques of community development. Coordination and integration on a national scale will be effected through the newly-created National Community Development Planning Council.\r\nAs a result of our combined efforts in agricultural extension work and community development through self-help, total production in agriculture increased appreciably last year.\u00a0 National production of the principal food items reached 7.2 million metric tons, showing a self-sufficiently ratio of 114.6 per cent.\u00a0 But this achievement is still short of consumption requirements in such critical items as meat and poultry, milk and dairy products, cacao and coffee.\r\nDespite vigorous measures, we have not as yet solved stubborn rice problem.\u00a0 Palay production was not enough for our people\u2019s needs.\u00a0 But deficiencies in marketing, warehousing, and financing prevented the rice from reaching the consumer at fair prices.\r\nThe NARIC should, therefore, be provided with enough funds for stabilization operations.\u00a0 The coordination of the activities of the NARIC and the FACOMAS must be improved.\r\nAs a further measure to increase rice production, the carabao, indispensable to most of our farmers, must continue to be protected from slaughter.\u00a0 To improve our nutrition, other livestock must be increased in number. We note that during the past year, the number of our carabaos rose to 2.7 million, showing an increase of about nine per cent.\u00a0 Because of this increase and the ban on their slaughter, the price of carabaos has gone down considerably, making it easier for the poor farmers to acquire them.\r\nAs we shift from deficiency to surplus production in the next two or three years, we must meet the problems of marketing and processing.\u00a0 Together with the farmer\u2019s cooperatives, private trade organizations will have to assume the brunt of responsibility for the efficient handling of our principal products.\u00a0 We should, therefore, encourage more of our people to go into these activities.\r\nAt the same time, the Government should continue its policy of maintaining the floor price for rice and other principal products as an incentive to real, substantial gains in production.\r\nWhen this Administration assumed office, we promised to encourage free unionism under responsible leadership.\u00a0 We have kept our pledge.\r\nThe number of workers organized into labor unions nearly doubled during the past year.\u00a0 This means that labor has improved its collective bargaining position for better wages and working conditions.\r\nThe Government\u2019s role in this growing movement has been, not to dominate as in the past, but to provide the necessary guidance so that will be free, democratic, and responsible.\u00a0 Among other activities to achieve this end, short-tern regional schools on responsible labor leadership have been conducted in different regions of the Philippines.\u00a0 This program, together with a similar training program for employer and management groups, will be expanded until we shall have brought about better understanding of labor and its problems.\r\nBy and large, labor-management relations improved. More collective bargaining agreements were signed.\u00a0 With further encouragement, many more will be signed this year.\r\nThe enforcement of laws and measures for the protection of workers was intensified.\u00a0 The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission finished twice as many cases as it did in 1953.\u00a0 The Wage Administration Service (WAS) secured for worker claimants a total of 1.5 million pesos in wage restitutions.\r\nOn the subject of wages, I would like to reiterate my conviction that only the most compelling reasons clearly related to the national interest could justify changes in the Minimum Wage Law.\u00a0 This Administration will not lightly regard any action that may adversely affect the workman\u2019s continuing struggle for a decent life.\r\nIn the field of industrial development, some progress has been achieved by private enterprise with government stimulus and encouragement.\u00a0 Induced by tax exemptions, 72 new industrial plants were established during the year.\u00a0 More processing industries are utilizing local raw materials.\r\nEncouraging results in manufacturing and processing are evident from the increase by 28.2 per cent in the output of reporting manufacturing establishments, which amounted to 752 million pesos in 1954, compared to 586.5 million pesos in 1953.\u00a0 Another index of the improving industrial situation is the increase by 24.5 per cent in capital-goods imports, amounting to 125.2 million pesos, for the first eight months of 1954, compared to the same period in 1953.\r\nTo supplement private enterprise, the Government has taken direct measures to promote certain industries.\u00a0 During the year under review, the cement plant at Bacnotan, La Union, was completed and the Insular Sugar Refining Company (INSUREFCO) reopened.\u00a0 The Government has organized the machinery to handle the promotion and development of the coconut and tobacco industries.\r\nOn the other hand, the Government has leased the Manila Hotel to private enterprise announced the sale to private operators of three ocean-going vessels owned by the National\u00a0 Development Company, and withdrawn from international airline operations.\u00a0 It is also considering other measures in this direction, in accordance with its policy of confining its investment activities to those phases of development essential to the public welfare.\r\nLikewise in line with the policy just stated, the Government has advanced the power development program, an essential pre-requisite to industrial growth.\u00a0 During the year, the Talomo No.2-B hydro-electric plant in Davao was completed.\u00a0 Work continued according to schedule on two big projects at Ambuklao and Cristina, with a combined capacity of 100,000 KW\u2014as well as on four smaller hydro-electric projects at Digos and Talomo, Davao; Balombong, Catanduanes; and Amburavan, La Union.\u00a0 Work has been started on four more small hydro-electric projects, with a total capacity of 4,500 KW located at Pe\u00f1aranda, Nueva Ecija;\u00a0 Loboc, Bohol;\u00a0 Barit, Camarines Sur;\u00a0 and Agusan River, Bukidnon.\r\nViewed against the immensity of our needs, these developments are modest, indeed.\u00a0 They do not measure up to our hopes of a greatly accelerated industrial pace that would provide work and abundance for our people.\r\nBut they do indicate the significant fact that we are steadily forging ahead.\u00a0 What is more, an atmosphere of optimism and enterprise has been gradually developing and is becoming manifest in the form of actual projects and those in prospect this year.\u00a0 This has been accompanied by a growing realization of the necessity of providing incentives for and promoting industrial growth.\r\nLast year, I recommend in my state-of-the-nation message that we support our own economic pioneers and set up a stable basis under which foreign investors can put their capital to work in this country.\r\nCongressional policy on these matters is as necessary as executive action.\u00a0 I, therefore, reiterate my previous recommendations.\u00a0 To particularize, I would urge the adoption of legislation embodying the following policies:\r\nOur Government should give full encouragement to the establishment by private enterprise of new industries which will advance economy.\r\nOur development program must be based, and should rely mainly, on internal financing.\u00a0\u00a0 We must promote the widest and most effective utilization of our resources.\r\nWe will welcome foreign capital.\u00a0 To encourage and facilitate its entry, we should specify the conditions governing the repatriation of capital, the remittance of profits and earnings, the protection of foreign investment, and other essential conditions.\r\nI cannot over-emphasize the urgent need for these measures.\u00a0 We are facing a tremendous unemployment problem.\u00a0 The direct, practical way of meeting it is to create jobs through the establishment of new industries.\r\nThe country\u2019s financial position is stronger today that it was a year ago.\r\nThe banking system is more sound.\u00a0 According to Central Bank data, as of October 31, 1954, total bank resources amounted to P1,335,000,000, showing an increase of P64,600,00 compared to those of the same period in 1953.\u00a0 Total deposits amounted to P964,300,000, increasing by about nine per cent.\u00a0 Saving and time deposits in all banks amounted to P414,800,000, showing an increase of P61,500,000.\r\nWhile the financial status of the banking system is sound, their lending operations need improvement.\r\nAs of September 30, 1954, the total loans granted by all banks amounted to P337,800,000, which sum is greater by P28,400,000 than that of the previous year.\u00a0 Of these total loans granted, those for commercial and real estate purposes increased considerably, while those for industry and agriculture decreased.\u00a0 This decline indicates that we have not as yet changed the customary pattern of bank lending in this country.\r\nI realize that complex forces make it difficult to bring about the desired shift which will give due emphasis to industrial and development loan financing.\u00a0 But this re-orientation in objectives is imperative.\r\nA re-examination should be made of our lending policies with a view of expanding development loans.\u00a0 I would urge Congress to examine the various proposals on this matter and enact implementing legislation either to extend the operations of our existing credit institutions or to establish new financing machinery for industrial and agricultural development.\r\nWe should also consider the extension of more substantial credit assistance to small enterprisers and producers.\u00a0 The recent credit assistance given by the Philippine National Bank and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation to small producers of rice, cassava, citrus, ramie, coffee, and livestock, is in the right direction.\r\nWe have maintained our international reserves at a satisfactory level through the exchange control measures of the Central Bank.\r\nThere have been, however, an unfavorable balance of trade amounting to 93.7 million pesos, and an adverse balance of international payments, amounting to 13.6 dollars, as of November 30, 1954.\u00a0 These are symptoms of fundamental defects in our economy.\u00a0 They must be remedied to attain internal stability.\r\nOne remedial measure is the conservation of our dollar reserves through the proper allocation of dollars among top-priority imports, giving special emphasis to capital-building items, raw materials, and basic necessities.\r\nA more permanent approach to this problem would be the adoption of program to promote foreign trade and to increase our exports.\r\nI would, therefore, ask Congress to consider the advisability of creating a Foreign Trade Commission to plan a foreign trade program and pursue its implementation; the establishment of Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce and Industry, to help standardize Philippine products, especially those for export; and the creation of a Maritime Commission that will undertake he promotion and development of adequate water transportation.\u00a0 Proper incentives for the increase of our exports should be seriously considered.\r\nIn connection with the foreign trade program, I wish to emphasize that the proposed revision of our trade agreement with the United States will require vital readjustments in our economy.\u00a0 We should anticipate and be prepared to meet the impact of the new situation.\r\nIn the first year of this Administration, Government finances improved.\r\nIn my state-of-the-nation message last year, I stated that the ordinary operational expenses should never exceed the total revenues in any fiscal year.\u00a0 This we have complied with.\r\nFor the first eleven months of last year, the General Fund income totaled P545,949,737.13, against total expenditures of P535,197,009.81, thus showing a surplus of P10,752,727.32.\r\nIn the same period of the preceding calendar year, the deficit amounted to P48,739,577.25\r\nThus, the practice of deficit spending for ordinary operating expenses has become a thing of the past.\r\nRevenue collections increase by P43,789.669.84.\u00a0 This is the result of greater effort in tax collection, as well as a manifestation of the new confidence in the Government.\r\nWe have succeeded in reducing the operating expenses of the Government by P37,967,112.26.\u00a0 Since December 31, 1953, we have succeeded in restoring to the various special funds a total of nine million pesos, out of 17 million pesos owed by the General Fund under the past administration.\r\nOn the other hand, we have increase capital expenditures for economic development by 22.3 million pesos during the past year.\u00a0 This is an investment in the economic stability and security of this country.\r\nOur public debt, as of December 31, 1954, was P1,168,000,000 of which 848 million pesos was incurred by the National Government; 253 million pesos by government corporations; and 67 million pesos by provincial, city, and municipal governments.\u00a0 The increase of 65.4 million pesos in the public debt outstanding by the end of 1954 was largely due to the Administration\u2019s policy of accelerating economic development.\u00a0 This is evidence by additional issues of Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) bonds aggregating P59,000,000, increased flotation of National Power Corporation (NPC) bonds amounting to P6,400,000,000 ACCFA obligations of P7,000,000, and the sale of new public works and economic development bonds totaling P11,900,000.\u00a0 However, budgetary debts contracted by previous administrations have been reduced by P18,900,000.\r\nThe improvement in government finances during the first year of this Administration does not mean, however, that we are anywhere near solution of the Government\u2019s financial problem.\u00a0 The General Fund deficit and the unrecorded obligations of the Government, amounting to P275,260,000 as of December 31, 1953, must still be settled.\u00a0 Outstanding budgetary loans amounting to P160,000,000, plus P550,000,000 in backpay obligations, must be paid.\r\nIt must be clear by now that even with he increase in revenue by P43,700,000, the ordinary income of the Government is not enough to provide for all essential services.\u00a0 Among these are the training of reserves for the citizens\u2019 army, the restoration of the seventh grade in the elementary schools, and the salary adjustments of teachers and other government employees, which have been deferred.\u00a0 Some important projects had to be curtailed.\u00a0 We are studying these problems very seriously, especially the salary adjustments of teachers.\u00a0 I will send you a special message on these matters in due time.\r\nOwing mainly to fund limitation, our program of capital expenditures fir top-priority public development projects and public works has not been fully implemented.\r\nThus, our principal difficulty today, as at the beginning of our Administration, is still lack of funds.\u00a0 I would urge Congress, therefore, to give full consideration to the need for additional appropriations to expand and improve the tax collecting agencies, particularly the Internal Revenue and the Customs bureaus.\r\nI must reiterate my previous recommendation for legislation imposing heavier penalties for tax evasion.\r\nRealizing that our current tax collection are not sufficient to provide for all essential public services, we must redouble our efforts to improve the tax collection machinery so that all the essential operating expenses of the public service could be met.\r\nThe financing of capital investments and permanent public improvements for economic development is another matter.\u00a0 We must be prepared to increase existing tax rates, levy new taxes, or resort to public borrowing for the purpose of accelerating or economic development.\r\nHowever, we must not countenance the use of this last-mentioned method of financing for operating expenses, except in very extreme cases involving national calamities.\r\nIn my state-of-the-nation message to Congress last year, I emphasized the need for a coordinated program of economic development.\r\nAt my behest, the staff of the National Economic Council drafted a five-year program, the general outlines of which I presented to the nation in an address at the Far Eastern University on March 20, 1954.\u00a0 The modest record which I have just reviewed, follows the general pattern and objectives of that program.\r\nOur five-year plan has never been intended to be the last word in economic planning.\u00a0 It is a continuing one.\u00a0 It is to be revised and updated each year, on the basis of past performance, changing conditions, and the prospects of further advance.\r\nIn this constant work of revision, constructive criticism is always welcome.\u00a0 I am happy to note the mounting interest in the first revision of the program now underway, which indicates popular support of this Administration\u2019s objective of coordinated and integrated economic development.\r\nI must reiterate, however, the recommendation made in my state-of-the-nation message last year for the revitalization of the National Economic Council (NEC) as a really effective agency to plan and put into effect the economic development program.\u00a0 I would also recommend other essential administrative and organizational reforms to fully implement the program, such as the establishment of a development financing agency to arrange for the financing requirements of the program.\r\nWe have found that fundamental weaknesses in the existing administrative machinery cannot be corrected by administrative action.\u00a0 These will continue to hamper our efforts, as they have in the past unless corrected by legislation.\r\nWhile we have devoted much or our energies to the problems at home, our international relations have not been neglected.\u00a0 Our foreign policy has served as an effective instrument in the promotion of the national interest.\r\nAs I have noted, we have strengthened our national security through various defense arrangements.\r\nSimilarly, we have made progress towards economic stability.\u00a0 The most important step in this direction was the conclusion of the negotiations for the revision of our trade relations with the United States.\u00a0 The Philippine Economic Mission headed by Senator Jose P. Laurel deserves the gratitude of our people.\r\nThe spirit of mutual respect and understanding in which the negotiations were conducted reflects credit equally on the Philippines and the United States.\u00a0 It is yet another manifestations of the desire of both countries to maintain their close and mutually beneficial relations.\r\nHere at home Philippine-American collaboration was closet in the joint undertaking to assist our country\u2019s economic development, through the PHILCUSA-FOA program.\u00a0 With the wholehearted cooperation of the FOA mission staff, we have succeeded in speeding up the various projects, many of which are now being transferred as regular operating units of the different agencies of our Government.\r\nI trust that Congress will continue to provide the necessary counterpart funds as well as the supplementary appropriations needed to operate the essential projects in this effective joint aid program.\r\nWe have also strengthened our ties with several Asian countries.\u00a0 Diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea have been established.\u00a0\u00a0 We have extended official recognition to the new sovereign states of Laos and Cambodia.\u00a0 We have reached agreement with the Republic of Indonesia on the problem of immigration.\r\nAt the Manila Conference held last September, we helped advance the cause of freedom and self-determination in Asia by our sponsorship of the Pacific Charter and its unanimous approval.\r\nIn the interest of peace and economic progress in this region, we joined the Colombo plan as a full-fledged member.\u00a0 We have continued to cooperate with the Arab-Asian members of the United Nations in matters of common concern.\r\nIn the United Nations, we have actively cooperated with like-minded states in strengthening the fabric of international peace and security.\u00a0 We shall continue to uphold the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe balance sheet of our international relations shows encouraging gains.\u00a0 But we still have before us a catalogue of unfinished business.\r\nThe reparations questions remains to be settled.\u00a0 There is urgent need for the full implementation of the United States military assistance.\u00a0 The system of joint military defense and economic collaboration envisaged in the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty is yet to be worked out.\u00a0 The signatories to this Treaty are due to meet soon in Bangkok.\u00a0 I hope that the Treaty may be ratified by the Senate before that meeting.\r\nThe proposed revision of our trade agreement with the United States will require action on your part.\u00a0 I shall address a special message to you on this matter at the appropriate time.\r\nThis Administration has made every effort to secure for our people the material benefits of democracy.\u00a0 It has worked equally hard to build up the spiritual strength of the nation.\r\nTo this end, we have insisted upon the strict observance of morality in the conduct of government business.\u00a0 We have moved swiftly and sternly against proven acts of abuse, injustice, and corruption.\u00a0 On the other hand, we have gone out of our way to commend worthy and civic-spirited acts.\r\nThe Government has looked promptly into reported irregularities.\u00a0 The Presidential Complaints and Action Committee has rendered valuable assistance in this regard.\u00a0 It has helped to make the Government truly a government of the people.\r\nIn the past, many of our people who had legitimate complaints did not air their grievances because of distrust or fear.\u00a0 Others thought it useless to go to a government deaf to their pleas.\u00a0 Under this Administration, the people in their simple faith have not hesitated to come forward for redress.\r\nOut of 59,144 complaints received by the PCAC up to the end of last year, 31876 cases were closed and 26,780 were being followed up in the different government offices.\u00a0 In the PCAC itself only 497 cases were still pending.\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 cannot be expressed by these or other statistics is the service agency has performed in demonstrating to our people that this is a Government truly responsive to their will and their needs.\u00a0 The PCAC has done a good job and should be given every facility to carry on its important task.\r\nI am aware of our people\u2019s desire to see quick results in punishing the guilty and ridding the Government of those who would pull it down by their greed and dishonesty.\u00a0 We are pledged to satisfy that desire by every legitimate means.\r\nHowever, we cannot, we must not ignore the democratic processes which it is our duty to uphold.\u00a0 I must state once more that under this Government, no one\u2014whether friend or foe, citizen or alien\u2014no one will be denied due process and the equal protection of the law.\u00a0 But, consistent with these principles consecrated by our free way of life we will continue to wage uncompromising war on corruption and abuse.\r\nRespect for basic human rights must continue to be one\u00a0 of our prime concerns.\u00a0 We must live up to our pledge to act as guardians of the dignity and worth of the individual.\r\nThese are the things that have been done and the things that still must be done.\u00a0 The past year has been, above all, a record of the achievements of the people themselves.\u00a0 It has also been witness to our honest endeavors in the task of enriching our people\u2019s.\r\nTo be sure, the high hopes of our people have not all been fulfilled.\u00a0 Some of the things expected of us have not been done\u2014or not done well enough\u2014perhaps because they simply could not be done; perhaps because we have not had time enough to do them; perhaps because we have been momentarily distracted from our task.\r\nLet us admit: among some of our people, there is impatience\u2014the impatience of great expectations born of the boundless faith reposed upon us by our people.\r\nFar from discouraging us, this should give us fresh inspiration to outdo ourselves, to live up to our people\u2019s faith, to spend ourselves to the limit to promote their happiness.\r\nFar from dividing us, it should bring us closer together.\u00a0 Our people have closed ranks; we can do no less.\u00a0 Nothing useful, nothing permanent, can be built on a foundation of disunity.\u00a0 More than ever before\u2014in all matters involving the common welfare\u2014we must provide a united leadership worthy of the confidence and support of all our people.\r\nIt is with this firm resolve that we should\u2014together\u2014look forward to the year before us.\r\nThe goal set is high.\u00a0 The accumulation of past and present problems, heavy.\u00a0 But you and I face them squarely\u2014not alone, but with our great people at our side, equally determined to achieve the impossible, equally eager to give their all, that our nation may live in dignity and freedom.\r\nMay God look upon us today and give us the strength and wisdom to serve our people devotedly and well.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},

SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:\r\nThree years ago, as partners under the Constitution, we started on our mission of serving the people. As we enter upon our fourth year, it is timely that we review the results of our endeavors. Thus we may gain the proper perspective from which to view the work still undone.\r\nWhen we started on this mission, we set for ourselves four main objectives:\r\n(1) To safeguard the security of the nation;\r\n(2) To promote the moral and material well-being of our masses;\r\n(3) To develop and stabilize the national economy; and\r\n(4) To improve the standards of public service.\r\nHow much has been done towards these objectives? How much more is to be done?\r\nOur first main objective has been the promotion of national security. This is in accordance with the constitutional mandate that the defense of the State is the prime duty of Government. To accomplish this end, we have proceeded on the basic premise that freedom is indivisible. We are secure in our freedom only as the world around is secure. Our efforts towards attaining our own security must, therefore, embrace the larger objective of contributing, however modestly, to the promotion of the peace and freedom of the world.\r\nAccordingly, next only to our faith in the justice and mercy of God, we have placed our primary hopes for the attainment of this objective in the United Nations. With our recent election to the Security Council of the United Nations, an aspiration of the Philippine Government since 1951, we have gained an opportunity to participate more fully in the task of preserving international tranquility.\r\nWithin the framework of the United Nations Charter, we have pressed for the self-determination of subject peoples. We were active in helping to bring about the approval of the cease-fire resolution in the Israel-Egyptian crisis. We aligned ourselves forthrightly with the countries that con\u00addemned Soviet aggression in Hungary.\r\nPursuant to the same Charter, we have entered into regional and bilateral arrangements for our defense. Developments indicate that the Manila Pact, which we signed in September, 1954, has been one of the effective factors in deterring Communist aggression in Southeast Asia. In keeping with our treaty obligations, we have intensified our participation in the planning and activities of SEATO. It is to the interest of national security that we insure our ability to participate even more actively in this organization.\r\nParallel to this multi-lateral agreement, we continue to bolster our external defense through our mutual security arrangements with the United States of America. Such close relations as those which have resulted from these arrangements have naturally produced varied problems, Some of these we have solved\u2014such as the question of the ownership of the base lands. Other problems, such as those discussed by our panel in the military bases talks, will require further negotiation. I am confident that the friendship which underlies the relations between our two countries will yield solutions consistent with our national dignity and security.\r\nIn a very real sense, international understanding strength\u00adens peace. With this objective in mind, we took steps to come closer to other countries of the free world, particularly those of Asia and Africa. To the allies that we had gained in SEATO, we added the new friends we made through participation in the Asian-African Conference of 1955. We resolved the Japanese reparations issue, ended the state of war with Japan, and established diplomatic relations with her.\r\nWe recognized and exchanged diplo\u00admatic representatives with various new Asian and African states and effected the long neglected diplomatic exchange with Burma.\r\nWe have also accredited a resident minister to the Federal Republic of Germany. Cultural and technical exchanges between the Philippines and other countries, especially in Asia, have never been as extensive as in the past three years.\r\nOur internal security has consistently improved. Our Armed Forces, having broken the back of the Communist armed rebellion, continue to seek out and destroy dissident remnants.\r\nHowever, our military success has caused the Communists, abetted by foreign agents, to concentrate on the subversive phase of their movement. Their objective to overthrow the Government remains. But they would now achieve this principally by means other than force\u2014by infiltrating the Government and private organizations, by seeking the legalization of their political activities, and by prostituting the democratic process\u2014although this new strategy could at any time shift once again to armed rebellion.\r\nTo check this subversion and prevent the resurgence of armed dissidence, as well as to enable the Armed Forces to discharge their responsibility in the maintenance of our external security, we must keep them in a state of adequacy and preparedness.\r\nThe House Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities has recently made public a timely report on how best to meet this new direction in Communist tactics. Two of its recommendations, namely, the outlawing of the Communist Party and the amendment of the law on treason so as to make it applicable even when actual international hostilities do not exist would require specific legislative measures for their implementation. It is well that a Committee of this Congress has recognized the need of giving the Government the legal strength with which to anticipate and frustrate the Communists in their new approach. I would ask your action on such legislation.\r\nThese policies to safeguard the security of the nation have brought about the necessary climate tranquility and order for the effective pursuit of our other objectives.\r\nWe have pressed our program of social justice.\r\nFrom the outset of our administration, we have emphasized the need for reforms and improvements in our land tenure system. Similarly, we have stressed the urgency of promoting the development of our rural communities.\r\nThrough tenancy and land reform measures, we have improved the living conditions of our tenants and farmers. More than that, these new measures have opened up the path to land ownership. But ownership alone will not ensure to the small farmer the full enjoyment of his land. For this, it is necessary that he should operate his farm efficiently. We have, therefore, redoubled our efforts in assisting him to become an efficient farmer.\r\nSince 1954, we have vigorously campaigned against the exploitation of tenants by their landlords. We are succeeding. We have helped the tenants secure a greater share of the fruits of their labors. Last year, the Court of Agrarian Relations was established. Within the brief period of its existence, this Court has shown its effectiveness in the settlement of tenancy disputes. This is a fresh advance towards agrarian peace.\r\nThe rate of land resettlement and land purchase for redistribution has not reached our expectations. It must be accelerated. But in another phase of land tenure improvement\u2014the issuance of land patents\u2014we have made unprecedented progress. The Bureau of Lands in the last three years granted a total of 124,200 land patents to qualified settlers.\r\nThis figure is more than five times the total number of land patents issued during the period from 946 to 1953. This fact not only reflects our intensified efforts in public land distribution but also attests to a significant advance in land reform. It means that we are setting up thousands of small independent farmers on land of their own, with the opportunity to work out a decent living for themselves and their families.\r\nTwo principal factors have contributed to the moral and material uplift of the people in our rural areas; namely, the rapid organization and dynamic operation of the farmers\u2019 cooperatives and the speedy implementation of the rural health program. ACCFA has organized a total of 416 farmers\u2019 cooperative marketing associations (FACOMAs) with paid-up capital of nearly P5 million. In 1953, marketing cooperatives with 6,643 members operated in 110 barrios. Today, these cooperatives exist in 10,314 barrios in 47 provinces, with a total membership pf 241,000.\r\nThese farmers\u2019 cooperatives, with the support of ACCFA, have granted their members loans amounting to P98 million. In addition, the 68 rural banks now in existence, under a liberal Government policy, have extended loans to small farmers and tenants amounting to P26 million. Never before have our small farmers and tenants been afforded so much cheap credit, freeing them from the evils of usury and helping them to improve their lot.\r\nWe should now extend the proven benefits of cooperative organization throughout the country. We should carry the cooperative spirit not only to all the barrios but also to the towns and cities, by stimulating the establishment of credit unions, consumers\u2019 cooperatives, and wholesale cooperative associations. In support of this program, we are giving earnest consideration to the advisability of establishing a bank for cooperatives.\r\nThe improvement in agricultural production\r\nand the general confidence among the rural people in the various measures introduced for their benefit are due in large measure to the agricultural extension workers and other technicians in the field. The teachers and school administrators connected with the community schools, the purok organizations, and the community development officers are equally effective in helping our communities make fuller use of their own capabilities and resources.\r\nThe people, whose welfare is the reason for the existence of the State, is also its most important resource. To promote this welfare and to sustain this resource, we have greatly expanded our health programs, especially where it is most needed\u2014in the rural areas.\r\nWhen we started in 1954, there were 81 rural health units. Today they number 1,100.\r\nIndicating its great expansion, the public health service now covers 1,280 of the 1,300 municipalities in the country.\r\nWe have greatly increased public medical and hospital facilities.\r\nYet, much more is needed to meet the increasing needs of our people. We must continue to prosecute our public health program with vigor.\r\nAs an added measure of social amelioration, we have pushed forward an extensive program for the construction of roads, irrigation systems, and artesian wells.\r\nDuring the last three years, we constructed and improved 5,273 kilometers of roads at a total cost of P153.5 million. We built 4,372 kilometers of graded roads for the small towns and barrios, at a total cost of P28.2 million. We completed five irrigation systems,\r\nservicing 25,400 hectares, at a cost of P11.2 million and 95 communal irrigation projects, serving 43,000 hectares, at a cost of P127 million. We installed 188 irrigation pumps servicing 31,000 hectares. We drilled 5,885 artesian wells and completed communal water systems and spring improvements.\r\nUnder construction starting last year are 33 gravity irrigation systems covering an irrigable area of 152,250 hectares of an estimated cost of P94,645,100. This irrigable area is greater than the area irrigated by all the irrigation systems constructed by the Government from 1907 to 1953.\r\nIn addition to this, the Bureau of Public Works has programmed for 1957 to 1960 the construction of irrigation systems covering 244,100 hectares at an estimated cost of P147,000,000. This will bring the total irrigation area to 556,939 hectares, which is about five times that irrigated by the systems constructed from 1907 to 1953.\r\nSubstantial gains have also been in the field of labor. We have encouraged the growth of strong and democratic unions. For every worker who held a union card at the beginning of our administration, there are now three. The number of registered labor unions reached a total of 2,216 in 1956, representing an increase of nearly 300 per cent over of that 1954.\r\nWe have given vitality to the Magna Charta of labor and other labor laws.\r\nCollective bargaining has gained general acceptance. The Government has promoted regional labor-management conferences that have strengthened the basis of individual peace. Today Philippine labor enjoys greater security ever before.\r\nThe advances made in public education are no less significant. We have continued to give support and encouragement to the education of our youth, particularly in the remote communities. The increase in the number of schools and school teachers during the last three years has been considerable. We now have 104,250 teachers, compared with 91,665 three years ago. From 23,600 public schools in 1953, the number has increased to 26,370 in 1956. Our pre-fabricated school building program has assisted in providing during the last two years additional schoolhouses for the barrios.\r\nThe promotion of the well-being of our masses, through the measures I have described, has given them opportunities for a richer and fuller life\r\nwhich they have never enjoyed in our history. It has restored their faith in Government as an instrument for the political, economic, and social advancement of all the people, not of just a privileged few. Today the common people know and feel that they have a Government they can depend upon to protect their rights and promote their interests. In this way they have acquired a real stake in the preservation of our democratic way of life, and will not be easy prey to the deceptive promises of a false ideology.\r\nAll the people are the richer because of this. It is error to think we can ever achieve economic development and progress as long as the majority of our people live in substandard conditions. They would always be a drag on the entire nation. Their well-being is the solid foundation for real progress in economic development.\r\nOur primary economic goal has been to strengthen and broaden the base of our economic activities. For unless a greater number of our people are engaged in productive enterprises sufficiently diversified to supply our basic necessities, increase the opportunities for employment, and raise the income of our workers, our economic structure will be weak and lopsided.\r\nWe will reach this goal by a balanced agricultural and industrial development. Thus we must continue to work towards reshaping our economic structure with the industrial side accounting for a rising proportion of our total output in the years ahead. We must foster an economy in which industrial expansion and agricultural progress are complementary. Industry can draw its raw materials from agriculture; in turn, as our farmers increase their income, the products of industry will have an expanding domestic market. In this way, there will be formed a partnership of enduring strength and a sound pattern for unlimited growth.\r\nWe are moving towards this goal.\r\nThe volume of national production has increased. In 1956, the total volume of farm, forest, mineral, and manufacturing production was higher by 30 per cent than that of 1953.\r\nFarm and forest production rose by 26 per cent; mineral production, by 11 \u00bd per cent. The output of our manufacturing industries registered a gain of 38 per cent, the highest made in any sector of the economy.\r\nThis rise in overall production is reflected in the national income. In 1953 the national income was 7 billion, 234 million pesos. In 1955, this went up to 7 billion, 804 million pesos, showing an increase of P570 million.\r\nAs I have stated, it was in the manufacturing sector of our economy where the greatest advance was attained. Thus, in 1956 alone, 175 manufacturing concerns qualified as new and necessary industries. We now have a total of 719 concerns which are engaged in new and essential industrial activities. Their total investment has now reached Php396 million.\r\nThe rapid progress attained in manufacturing may be gauged by considering the variety of consumer products which are now manufactured locally and are beginning to meet demands of domestic consumption. Such items as wearing apparel, footwear, cigarettes, school and office supplies, building and electrical materials, tires, and certain food products\u2014all of which we used to import\u2014are now being supplied from Philippine manufactures.\r\nThis growth in manufacturing production is partly due to the application of exchange and import controls. we have permitted the increased importation of machinery and raw materials for new essential industries without necessarily sacrificing the importation of an adequate amount of essential consumer items. It was due to this policy that our international reserves went down from $305 million in 1953 to $209 million in 1955. However, at the end of 1956, by the judicious application of exchange and import controls, our international reserves rose to $226 million.\r\nIt is recognized that power is a basic requirement for our industrialization. We have thus stepped up power development, the cheapest source of which in our country is water power. During the past three years, we continued the construction of the Ambuklao Hydro-electric Project on the Agno River, begun under the previous administration. The work was completed last month and the plant was put in service to furnish 75,000 kilowatts to the people of Northern and Central Luzon and Manila. We completed other projects started under our administration, with a total capacity of 26,200 kilowatts\u2014the Maria Cristina No.2 Unit in Lanao, the Amburayan Chute Project in La Union, the Pe\u00f1aranda Chute Project. in Nueva Ecija, the Digos River and Talomo No. 2-B projects in Davao, and the Balombong .River Project in Catanduanes.\r\nWe now have under construction, to be completed this year, the Loboc River Project in Bohol, the Agusan River Project in Bukidnon, and the Barit River Project in Camarines Sur, with a total capacity of 4,200 kilowatts. We have begun the construction of the. Bi\u00f1ga Project on the Agno River with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts.\r\nOther projects, principally the Marikina Mu1ti Purpose Project with 60.000 kilowatts, the Maria Cristina No.3 Unit with 50,000 kilowatts, and the Bubonawan Project with 10,000 kilowatts will be started this year. All these, together with thermal and diesel-electric plants installed by private utility operators, will provide our people with the necessary power to turn the wheels of industry .and :with conveniences to make their homes more livable.\r\nTo lay the basis for the development of a metallurgical industry, the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASSCO) is now establishing, the first pig-iron smelting plants in the country. These plants will process iron ore coming from our own mines into pig-iron which, in turn, will be used by existing steel mills. NASSCO will also establish rolling mills for steel plates and sheets which will be used in shipyards and other fabricating shops.\r\nWhen all these plants are in operation within approx\u00adimately two years, we shall have gone a long way towards supplying our needs for iron and steel from our own resources.\r\nComplementary to the steps towards the development of the metallurgical industry, the Government should give impetus to further mineral exploitation, particularly of iron and other base metals. The large nickel-iron reserves in Nonoc Island, Surigao, which is now within a government reservation, should be opened for development. I recommend that Congress enact appropriate legislation on the matter.\r\nThe expansion of the economy, particularly in the in\u00addustrial sector, results in the growth of urban communities and increases effective demand for domestic production. It also gives rise to a variety of new occupations, especially in supplementary industries and distributive trades. All this means increasing opportunities for employment of our labor force.\r\nWith respect to the Government\u2019s participation in business, I would like to state once more our policy . The Government should limit such participation only to cases where reasons of national interest require it, or when such participation is desirable in order to stimulate private investment in a particular field.\r\nIn line with this policy, the Government has disposed, is prepared to dispose, of its enterprises\r\nwhich do not fulfill either of the purposes stated, subject, of course, to proper safeguards for the public interest.\r\nIn the achievement of these results, our effort has been guided in the main by the economic plan adopted at the start of our administration, which I announced on March 20, 1954.\r\nAs I stated more than once, the plan was not inflexible but was to be updated periodically on the basis of past performance, changing, conditions, and prospects of further advance.\r\nIn my state-of-the-nation message in 1954, I stressed the necessity of revitalizing the National Economic Council. To this end, Government Reorganization Plan No. 10 was approved in July, 1955, thus creating the machinery for the revision of the 1954 economic plan.\r\nIn the meanwhile, the end of free trade with the United States in 1955 and the then impending reparations agreement with Japan made it imperative that the newly reorganized Council begin the task of revision. Consequently, in September, 1955, I requested the National Economic Council to undertake the task. It soon became evident, however, that there were trends in the Council not in harmony with our fiscal policies. I reiterated these policies in my budget message to the Congress on February 6, 1956, which contained a comprehensive fiscal plan embodying an investment program and priorities in consonance with the 1954 economic plan.\r\nDespite this, the trends continued. As a consequence, changes came about in the Council\u2019s membership in March, 1956. It was then that the NEC was able to proceed with its work consistently with our economic program.\r\nOn January 3, 1957, the National Economic Council submitted its recommendations for updating the 1954 economic development program. These recommendations included a system of industrial priorities to govern the allocation of foreign exchange, the administration of the Government\u2019s fiscal operations, and the extension of credit. We have adopted this industrial priority system as a guide in the implementation of projects which will make the maximum contribution to production, employment, and income.\r\nAs the implementing arm of the Government to carry out its part, pursuant to the economic program, a national, development authority charged with this function and with the supervision of government corporations is definitely needed. I, therefore, recommend the enactment of a law creating such an authority.\r\nFrom the beginning, we have adhered to the principle, of promoting economic development without impairing monetary stability. We have, therefore implemented and coordinated our fiscal, monetary, and exchange control policies as instruments of development in accordance with this principle.\r\nThe annual fiscal budgets of the Government have given emphasis to public spending for economic development\r\n. purposes. Total expenditures for economic development since 1954 have amounted to 1 billion, 39 million pesos, having risen from P151 million in 1953 to P440 million in 1956.\r\nThe significant record of production over the last few years was supported by a credit policy which continued to emphasize liberal assistance to projects whose contribution to the national income and to economic development was deemed high. More credits for socially desirable projects were made available by the increased number of branches and agencies of domestic financial institutions and the creation of more cooperatives and rural banks.\r\nThe total outstanding credit of all financial institutions reached 2 billion, 827 million pesos by the end of 1956, representing an increase of more than 1 billion, 58 million pesos since 1953.\r\nDuring the same period, the share of agri\u00adculture and manufacturing in total bank credits increased substantially and the share of commerce and real estate correspondingly declined. This favorable shift in the pat\u00adtern of distribution of bank credits indicates the effective\u00adness of our credit policies.\r\nThe high level of Government spending for development and the expansion of credit obviously carry with them inflationary tendencies which affect monetary stability. Rising prices and other inflationary pressures in the principal industrial countries have added to these tendencies. We have managed our fiscal and monetary policies in such a way as to minimize the adverse effects of these pressures on internal and external stability. These policies and the accompanying increase in local production have kept these inflationary trends under control.\r\nTo insure a more effective distribution of public funds among essential and strategic development projects, the Budget commission has prepared a five-year program of public investment. In coordination with this program, the Central Bank has formulated a five-year foreign exchange budget designed to meet the most important requirements of both private and public investments for foreign exchange\r\nThe close coordination now existing between the fiscal and the monetary authorities is an assurance that the five year fiscal budget and the five-year foreign exchange budget will be carefully and properly implemented.\r\nWe are still faced with the problem of avoiding, in the months ahead, any marked increase in prices and in the cost of living arising from Government spending for development, as well as from inflationary trends abroad and the consequent heavy pressure on our international reserves.\r\nTo meet this problem, we will continue to adjust our foreign exchange allocations to the demand for essential consumer goods without impairing the requirements of high priority project. We will also keep our public borrowing through bond issue under constant review in order that any undue pressure on the reserves may be avoided.\r\nI realize that the success of all these policies and the effective use of all these instruments will depend on the extent to which the Government can create a climate that will encourage private investments. An important element of this climate is the structure of tariff rates. Our present tariff rates, however, are not adequate to serve the purpose of economic development. I urge, therefore, that Congress give priority to this matter.\r\nThere is, finally, one aspect of our foreign exchange resources which requires our immediate attention\u2014the need for properly directing the distribution and utilization of the goods and services from Japanese reparations. As part of our foreign exchange resources, these reparations payments will have to be synchronized and integrated with the allocation of all available financial resources of our country. Legislative authority is also necessary for a permanent office which would budget our requirements, supervise deliveries, and oversee the proper utilization and distribution of reparations goods and services in accordance with definite criteria.\r\nWhile we are engaged in the vital tasks of economic development, the Government must avoid unsound and dangerous policies which would nullify our gains.\r\nThere has been some agitation for the immediate and total removal of economic controls. As an ideal goal, an economy free from Government control is of course to be desired. However, under prevailing world conditions and in our present state of economic growth, the continuation of economic controls is a necessity. I would like to reiterate the view which I expressed on March 11, 1956, before the first Trade National Convention\r\nthat a system of exchange and import controls is still a necessary instrument today if we are to meet the requirements of our development projects and at the same time maintain the inflow of essential consumer goods not locally available.\r\nOur recent experience has confirmed the correctness of this view. In 1955, our international trade was greatly unbalanced. But, by the improved application of import and exchange controls, coupled with the growth of new and essential industries, we were able to reduce our trade deficit and achieved a favorable balance of payments position at the end of 1956.\r\nThrough the same means, we have been able to provide for the increased importation of machinery and raw materials and for the increased inflow of essential consumer goods to prevent any disrupting rise in domestic prices. This was done, on the one hand, by reducing further our non-essential imports and, on the other, by permitting the importation of an adequate amount of essential consumer goods. In this way, through exchange and import controls, we have been able to meet both the requirements of our growing industry and the basic needs of our people without impairing the stability of our currency.\r\nIn connection with our policy on exchange control, there is one aspect which I believe we should immediately re-examine. I refer to Republic Act No. 1410, otherwise known as the no-dollar import law. I entertained some appre\u00adhension about the wisdom of this legislation at the time it was presented to me for approval. But I thought we should give it a trial and so allowed the \u00b7bill to become a law without my signature. However, the general effects of transactions authorized under this law have been found to be inconsistent with the objectives of exchange and im\u00adport controls and may endanger the stability of our currency. I, therefore, urge the Congress to give this matter its immediate consideration.\r\nWe must be wary of measures which would have disas\u00adtrous effects on our economy. I am particularly concerned about any move that would bring economic difficulties to our average citizen. In countries with which we trade, inflation and other economic problems are being aggravated by the situation in the Middle East. The impact of such developments on our economy is inevitable. We cannot afford to create more problems in our country. Progress is possible only in an environment of economic stability.\r\nThese are the steps which we have taken towards national security, rural uplift, and economic development. In the pursuit of these objectives, it is essential that the Government be so organized and operated that it may serve as an effective instrument for their attainment.\r\nThe prime function of government is service to the people. It exists to protect their rights. It has been our policy that the Government shall not only respect the people\u2019s right but shall actively encourage their exercise.\r\nTo give meaning and substance to this positive approach to human rights, we established in 1954 the Presidential Complaints and Action Committee (PCAC). The enthu\u00adsiasm which met the creation of this Committee continues undiminished. It is one more reason why the people feel so strongly that the Government is truly theirs.\r\nThere is still another beneficial result. Its creation has had a salutary influence on the public service. By acting as a readily accessible agency for receiving complaints, the PCAC has served to deter official wrongdoing. Thus, it has helped us to carry out our pledge of morality and honesty in the public service.\r\nWe have not relaxed vigilance against misconduct in office. Public office is a stern task-master, and among its exacting requirements is that a public servant must not only be blameless, but above suspicion. Accordingly, complaints against official wrongdoing have been promptly investigated and, where justifies, the respondents have been dealt with in accordance with due process of law. There shall be no compromise with this resolve to maintain the highest standards of honesty and morality in the Government.\r\nIn order to discharge its mission, the public service must be possessed of still another essential attribute-efficiency. To bring this about, we have found it necessary to con\u00adsider a general reorganization of the various agencies of the government. Our efforts in this direction have resulted in comprehensive, scientific, and functional reorganization plans, some of which have already been duly implemented.\r\nGovernment service is only as efficient as the individual public servant is efficient. The public servant must, therefore, be provided with the necessary incentives to work efficiently and with the recognition that his efforts deserve. One of these incentives is adequate compensation. It is our resolve that this demand be satisfied within the limits of our financial resources. To this end, we are now pre\u00adparing for partial implementation of the plans formulated by the Wage and Position Classification Office (WAP\u00adCO), which would standardize government positions and provide for equitable compensation for services rendered. The budget which I shall submit to you next month will include this proposal.\r\nTo give more appropriate expression to the popular will, we believe that we should give greater stress to local auto\u00adnomy. In the daily lives of our people, the provincial city, municipal, and barrio agencies are the effective contacts between the citizen and his government. Further\u00admore, they are relied upon for the dissemination and execution of national policies.\r\nIn order to enable us to pay closer attention to the needs of local governments, I recommend the restoration of the Department of Interior. We are now considering specific proposals on this subject for your future action.\r\nMembers of the Congress: thus far we have gone in the past three years. We have provided for the national security, both within and without. Our masses, the vital object of our joint concern, have received priority in our efforts. Their well-being is para\u00admount.\r\nWe have made progress in the economic sphere.\r\nWe have worked hard to assure that our Government continue to protect the liberty and dignity of the individual. We have discharged the positive duty incumbent on gov\u00adernment of insuring the enjoyment of social and economic rights under the more complex conditions of this age.\r\nYet, much remains to be done.\r\nWe must continue our vigilance. Communism, with its ever-shifting tactics, remains a threat.\r\nWe cannot afford to falter in our social justice program. The masses of our people, the base of our democracy, will continue to be the beneficiaries of our special concern.\r\nWe must accelerate the pace of economic progress. Mindful of our duty to our people and determined in our goals, we must surpass our accomplishments of the past three years with a renewed dedication to the public welfare.\r\nMay God continue to guide us in the service of our people.\r\nI thank you.\r\nOther important international agreements entered into besides the Manila Pact, the revision of the Bell Act, and the Japanese Reparations agreement were: (1) Protocol on Trade Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Egypt, signed at Washington, January 18, 1955 (2) Exchanges of Notes extending the barter agreement between the Philippines and Japan; (3) Agreement concerning Migration of Filipino Labor for Employment in British North Borneo, signed at Manila on August 30, 1956; (4) Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America concerning civil uses of atomic energy, signed at Washington on July 27, 1955.\r\nThe Philippines recognized the States of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1955, and Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan in 1956. This year we will exchange diplomatic representatives with Egypt, where we established a consulate last year. Likewise we will establish diplomatic relations with Israel and are now negotiating diplomatic exchanges with Ceylon and Iraq.\r\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs sponsored the organization of the Cultural Foundation of the Philippines which, with private support, has begun a program of cultural exchange, especially with Asian countries. The Foundation has brought to the Philippines cultural groups from India and Indonesia and has sponsored a Philippine cultural mission to Taipeh. This year it expects to send a Philippine cultural group to other parts of Southeast Asia.\r\nThe Philippines availed itself of over 80 scholarships offered by different Asian countries under various cultural exchange programs. On the other hand, there has been an increased number of scholars and students from Southeast Asia who have come to the Philippines. This program of cultural exchange is conducted under the Cultural Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs with the cooperation of other official and private agencies.\r\nThese cover 650,000 hectares of agricultural lands.\r\nTotal agricultural production increased from 8,150,800 metric tons in 1953 to 9,049,500 tons in 1956, or by 11 per cent. Food crops increased by 8.8 per cent, from 5,781,200 tons in 1953 to 6,289,000 tons in 1956. Commercial or export crops increased by 16.5 per cent, from 2,369,600 tons in 1953 to 2,760,500 tons in 1956.\r\nThis number includes 801 completely staffed units, 233 incomplete units, and 66 junior units. A complete unit consists of a health officer, a nurse, a midwife, and a sanitary inspector. A junior unit is composed of two persons.\r\nWe have increased the number of government hospital beds from 7,475 in 1954 to 10,050; the number of doctors in these hospitals, from 342 to 629; nurses, from 770 to 1,651; and those in the technical staffs, from 426 to 715. Likewise, the number of government physicians in the field has increased from 439 in 1953 to 1,134 in 1956.\r\nUnder construction are 23 gravity irrigation systems to irrigate a total area of 124,800 hectares.\r\nThrough the Department of Labor and its 52 regional offices, laborers\u2019 claims have been more effectively enforced. Over the last three years nearly P3,000,000 was collected in wage restitutions.\r\nOf the 3,720 room units completed in 1956 by the Armed Forces, 1,593 have been erected in the different barrios. The rest are either in transit or in the process of erection. The number of room units constructed this year is almost three times that in 1950.\r\nOn another front of socio-economic amelioration, low-cost housing, the People\u2019s Homesite and Housing Corporation last year neared completion of Project 6 and 7 and started Project 8 near Manila, and broke ground for low-cost housing projects in Tagaytay, Cebu, and Tacloban. We have also relaxed the terms for acquisition of PHHC low-cost houses to encourage home ownership by low-income groups\r\nIndex of Physical Volume of Production\r\n(1953=100)\r\nCombined Index Agricultural(a) Mining Manufacturing\r\n1953 100\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- 100 100 100\r\n1954 111\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 111 96 112\r\n1955 120\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 118 105 127\r\n1956\r\n130\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 126 126 138\r\nCrop year figures include forestry and fisheries.\r\nEstimates for this year are based on figures for the first two quarter.\r\nSOURCE: Department of Economic Research, Central Bank of the Philippines.\r\nThe Government has withdrawn from the international airline service, leased the Manila Hotel, and offered for sale, through public bidding, the Bacnotan cement plant.

Of the total credits outstanding on October 31, 1956, P339,7000,000 are of the Central Bank; P1,644,200,000 are of commercial banks; P788,900,000 are of selected financial institutions consisting of the RFC, GSIS, ACCFA, rural banks, pawnshops, and building and loan associations.\r\n\u201cWe cannot hope to diversify our production end industrialize our econ\u00adomy without providing an increased amount of foreign exchange with which to purchase essential producers goods from abroad for our economic development. In brief, to achieve our goal of greater self-sufficiency for home consumption and to minimize our present dependence on imports, we must purchase abroad the machinery, equipment, and materials which will permit us to activate new industries. In this process our foreign exchange control system is of vital importance.\r\n\u201cAs our industrialization efforts become successful in the next few years and as our economy develops sufficiently to supply the home markets, we will become less and less dependent on this type of control as an artificial method of achieving our goals. But at the present time the judicious and controlled use of our foreign exchange is essential in order to give us access abroad to producers goods for major economic development projects. Only\u201d when a natural balance of imports and exports is reached can. we abandon our present system, perhaps coming to rely then on tariff measures for controls still needed.\u201d\r\nSubstantial progress was made in spreading our foreign trade to other areas. Our total trade with Northwest Europe in the first eight months of last year was 42.3 per cent above the corresponding period the year previous, and our total trade with Asia was up 13.5 per cent. For the first time since 1919, the United States in the first eight months of 1956 accounted for less than 60 percent of our total trade.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1939-01-24 12:12:40+00:00", "author": "Manuel L. Quezon", "text": "[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1939]\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nI take pleasure in congratulating you upon your election to this Second National Assembly, and to you, Mr. Speaker, I wish publicly to express my deep feeling of satisfaction that your distinguished colleagues have elevated you to this position of great responsibility and honor.\r\nAs we enter upon the second and last period of my administration, we should once more make public avowal of our objectives and of our firm determination to achieve them.\r\nThe Philippines is our country, and we shall make it the home of a free people\u2014not alone politically, but economically as well. And this economic freedom must not be limited to the concept of national self-sufficiency, but must extend to every hamlet and hearth in this land. For of what practical value can the \u201cright to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d be to a person, if he does not actually enjoy it and his only freedom consists in the freedom to starve or die?\r\nThis then is our ultimate goal: That the political rights vouchsafed to all our people by the Constitution be made real and effective by affording to every person willing to work the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood.\r\nThe First National Assembly laid the foundations for the attainment of this goal. It made an enviable record worthy of emulation. Only a visionary could claim that this task can reach fruition during the life of one administration or of even a generation. We have to rebuild our national structure on the solid and permanent foundation of social justice. Laws alone will not do it. We have to fight against prejudices, wrong notions, and outworn customs and traditions. We have to preach the fundamental principles of Christianity, and make them the underlying philosophy of our political and social institutions.\r\nThe great work initiated by the First National Assembly with such signal success we have to continue and carry forward. This is the mandate we have received from our people and which we dare not disobey.\r\nNo party has ever received such a vote of confidence as the Nationalist Party did at the last general election. Not a single candidate from the minority parties has been elected to this body. The faith and trust which our people have placed in our party in this extraordinary manner demands, in turn, from each of us extreme fidelity and devotion to duty. Not only must we steadfastly forge ahead with our determination to elevate to the topmost the moral, cultural, political, economic, and social conditions of our people, that they may be free from every sort of bondage, but our official acts and deeds should be such as to convince our people of the earnestness and honesty of our aims.\r\nAs the head of the State and the leader of our party, I venture to express the hope that the National Assembly will resist every temptation to divide itself into groups or blocs that may tend to weaken our unity of purpose and action. One of the dangers of such division lies in the possibility that the general interests of the nation may be overlooked, at least temporarily, and sacrificed for the benefit of the particular interests represented in the group or bloc. Obviously, one of the reasons why our people did not elect to the Assembly members representing the opposition is because they realize the importance of avoiding waste of time in political bickering in the proceedings of this body in these anxious days when every single energy we can command should be devoted to the difficult task of preparing our nation for an independent existence in an international situation so fraught with danger. Moreover, organized groups or blocs within a party are inconsistent with party responsibility and majority rule.\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, with your permission, I shall now proceed to give you a report on the state of the nation and to submit my recommendations regarding measures of first importance which I consider deserving of your prompt attention. From time to time, I shall take the liberty of sending to this body other messages concerning matters which, in my opinion, should be acted upon at this session.\r\nDuring the past year the country enjoyed peace and order. There have been conflicts between capital and labor, but without serious consequences. Both the Department of Labor and the Court of Industrial Relations are entitled to commendation for the happy solution of such conflicts. However, we would be closing our eyes to the realities of the situation were we to believe that labor in our country is satisfied with its lot. There is growing unrest and discontent, specially among the farm laborers, not due entirely to the activities of professional agitators and irresponsible so-called labor leaders. Our laborers cannot be easily led astray by agitators when they have no real grievances. The Government is deeply concerned with the well-being of our masses, and it will not cease in its efforts to better their condition until ample justice is secured to them.\r\nNew public schools and classes have been opened and the enrollment in the public schools last year was increased by over 243,000. Approximately 18,500 kilometers of roads were in existence at the end of the year, and new wharves and other port facilities have been constructed. Public hospitals have been increased or enlarged, and clinics and dispensaries have been established in many localities. We are making progress in providing the remotest sections of the country with the services of doctors, dentists and nurses, and it is my earnest hope that during the next three years every town will be provided with these services. Sanitary conditions have been improved. We have not had any serious outbreak of epidemics and every threat or danger was effectively checked. An important housing project has been started in the vicinity of Manila to permit wage-earners and low-salaried employees to acquire or build their own homes. Should this project be successful, as I hope it will be, similar projects will be initiated in other communities.\r\nGenerally speaking, our national defense program has been carried out as planned, both as to cost and the number of men trained. Two full classes of trainees have now been processed through the instructional cadres and their organization into effective military unit\u2019s proceeds apace. Acquisition of arms, equipment and supplies is in approximate step with the production of tactical units. The Air Corps is steadily evolving into an effective fighting unit, both as to personnel and to equipment.\r\nDeserving of special mention is the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio and its progress toward the establishment of a training course calculated to produce a highly trained, loyal and efficient professional leadership for our Army.\r\nOne accomplishment of the year toward which effort had been long directed was the separation of the Constabulary from the Army. From the beginning it was realized that law enforcement is not properly a military responsibility. Yet the necessity for using the Constabulary, as it existed in 1935, as the nucleus out of which to establish the Army\u2019s foundation, and the paucity of trained men for key positions had been the causes of the temporary consolidation heretofore existing. In the hope of avoiding wholesale transfers from the Army for police work, the establishment of a State Police from civilian sources was attempted in 1936. When the lack of trained personnel demonstrated that this method could succeed only if large numbers of officers and enlisted men were made available, it was decided, to avoid administrative complications, to separate from the Army the necessary individuals and organize them into a Constabulary. This has been done, and there is every reason to believe that the reconstituted organization will quickly earn a popular respect and prestige equal, and even superior, to the reputation in this regard enjoyed by the organization that existed prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth.\r\nAs a final word respecting the Army, I want to urge you, once again, to give to all matters concerning our future security the earnest consideration their fundamental importance deserves. If eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, let us then be ceaselessly vigilant. Our defensive system requires no unusual sacrifice by any individual, but its success depends primarily and almost exclusively upon a unification of the efforts of all toward this common and vital purpose. To attain such unification in a democracy, the military plan must be supported by popular intelligence, confidence, and enthusiasm. It is a special function of Government to see that this confidence is fairly earned and assiduously sustained. To this end let us see to it that every law we pass and every military measure we adopt shall reflect an unselfish and national purpose, that it shall impose injustice on none, and that it shall promote the security and defend the peace, the possessions and the liberty of all.\r\nThe business enterprises of the Government, especially the Philippine National Bank and the Cebu Portland Cement Company, were operated at a profit during the past year. The Manila Railroad Company has at long last completed its southern line. The gap which existed for many years between Tayabas and Camarines Sur was connected at a cost of about P2,000,000. This was one of my dreams that have come true. The significance of this achievement will be readily seen when we consider the fact that a daily, comfortable, fast and inexpensive communication service has been established between Manila and the Bicol provinces. At the same time the completion of this southern line means increased earnings for the railroad. The National Rice and Corn Corporation stabilized palay and rice prices at levels which, under the circumstances, properly safeguarded the interests of consumers and producers alike. The National Development Company is completing the construction of certain factories and studying the organization of others, in line with our policy to promote industrial development and provide more opportunities for the employment of labor. It is our policy with regard to many of these new industries merely to do pioneering work and ultimately to transfer them to private ownership and management.\r\nOur foreign trade during 1938 suffered a slight reduction, mainly on account of low prices for our export products. It is to be noted, moreover, that our imports increased materially, while our exports decreased in value resulting in larger imports than exports decreased in value, resulting in larger imports than exports. This is an unhealthy condition for a country like the Philippines and every step should be taken to guard against the persistence of this adverse balance of trade. This situation may be due in part to increased purchasing power as a result of the expenditure by the Philippine Government of proceeds of the excise taxes on Philippine products collected in the United States. At the beginning, these remittances were made through the Dollar Exchange Standard Fund which resulted in an increase of circulation. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, the necessary measures have been adopted to effect the transfer of these funds through normal bank exchange transactions, without the necessity of releasing new currency by the National Treasury.\r\nTax receipts exceeded budget estimates during the last year. The income from taxation, however, for the year 1938 was P8,076,362.49 below the collections for the year 1937, exclusive of the proceeds of the excise taxes from the United States. This reduction in revenue may be attributed to three causes: (1) the low prices for our agricultural products both for domestic consumption and for export, (2) the stock market slump during the year 1938, and (3) the fact that in 1937 large amounts were collected for taxes due in preceding years. Despite the reduction in the public revenues the fiscal position of the Government remains sound and strong. As the budget which I shall present to the National Assembly will reveal, the expenditures of the Government during the year 1938 were well within the income for that year, with an excess in collections accruing to the general fund over the ordinary expenditures amounting to P12,410,420.21 at the close of the year.\r\nThe low prices for our export crops during the past year were a serious blow to a large portion of our population. This emphasizes the necessity that we should endeavor to establish our economy in an ever-growing proportion on the basis of our home market, because export crops must face conditions which are beyond the control of our Government.\r\nAs I have already reported to the last National Assembly, the President of the United States, in consultation with me, appointed the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs to study and make recommendations concerning future trade relations between the United States and the Philippines. The Committee has submitted its report and recommendations to the President of the United States and to the President of the Philippines. Copies of this report were furnished to the members of this body. The report will be officially transmitted to the Assembly tomorrow. I commend it to your careful and earnest consideration. President Roosevelt and I have both approved the report and recommendations of the said Committee and it is my understanding that the President will urge the Congress to enact appropriate legislation to carry into effect those recommendations. One of these recommendations is to do away with the restrictions on the expenditure of the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil, and another is to bind copra and abaca free of United States duty during the Commonwealth period. While it is not necessary for the National Assembly to pass any legislation effectuating such recommendations until the Congress of the United States has acted thereon, I earnestly recommend that you approve a resolution endorsing the recommendations of the report, so that the Congress of the United States may be informed that, if it should take favorable action on said recommendations, the National Assembly would do likewise. It is my hope that the Congress of the United States will approve legislation putting into effect the recommendations of the report at an early date, in order to place American-Philippine trade relations on a more fair and equitable basis, and to permit the Philippines properly and intelligently to plan its economic adjustment in preparation for independence.\r\nIn connection with this matter, I have sent as my special representative to Washington the Honorable Sergio Osme\u00f1a. Vice-President of the Philippines, to conduct, with the cooperation of the Resident Commissioner, the necessary negotiations with the Government of the United States. With the authority, they have enlisted the assistance of the Honorable Antonio de las Alas, formerly Secretary of Finance. I am in constant touch with the Vice-President who is keeping me advised of the progress of their work. So difficult and delicate a task could not have been entrusted to better hands.\r\nYielding to the wishes of the members of the last National Assembly and of the business community, I agreed to defer action upon my proposals for a tax revision and appointed a Tax Commission to study the matter. The Tax Commission has effected a revision of our internal taxation, taking into consideration the fiscal adequacy of our system of public revenue, a more fair and just allocation of the tax burden, and the need of insuring a more equitable and sound redistribution of wealth. I also instructed the Commission to revise the tax system of our local governments with a view to supplying them with definite sources of revenue and a sufficient income to meet their growing needs. The report of the Tax Commission will be transmitted to you at an early date and I trust that it will receive your favorable attention.\r\nI also desire to submit to your consideration the enactment of necessary legislation for the settlement of sparsely populated regions of the Philippines, specially in Mindanao. This is important not only for obvious political reasons and as a means to promote economic development, but also to relieve the acute congestion of population existing in certain agrarian areas. The National Economic Council has recommended a carefully prepared plan to carry out this objective. The plan contemplates a ten-year program aiming at the settlement in these vacant areas of about 500,000 people on selected lands adapted to subsistence farming and the production of certain money crops. This project will require an estimated total outlay of P20,000,000 which may be appropriated from the proceeds of the excise taxes. The report and recommendations of the National Economic Council on this matter will be transmitted to the National Assembly within a few days.\r\nAnother problem which demands immediate attention concerns banking and credit, the cost of credit, and credit facilities for commerce, agriculture, and industry. The only institution in the Philippines that grants agricultural credit is the Philippine National Bank, but the limit fixed by law on the amount of the capital and resources of the Bank which may be invested in such credits has already been reached and the Bank is unable to give any more agricultural loans. Credit for capital investment is not available. There is practically no market for industrial bonds. Prevailing rates of interest charged by banks and private money lenders are still high, which fact is a drag upon economic enterprise and business prosperity. The National Economic Council is recommending a reform of our banking structure in order to remedy these evils. The Council proposes the creation of an investment bank for agriculture and industry, to which shall be transferred all the activities of the Philippine National Bank except those exclusively pertaining to commercial banking. The Council also recommends the establishment of a reserve and rediscount institution which will operate precisely in the same manner as the Federal Reserve System in the United States. This will provide a reasonable degree of elasticity and control over the money market and should immediately result in releasing for investment many millions of idle cash now prudently held by the banks as reserves in excess of legal requirements. These proposals will not only insure sufficient credit facilities at reasonable cost, but will, in my opinion, afford credit to small farmers, either directly or through cooperatives, and likewise to large industrial enterprises. Upon the approval of these measures, the Assembly may also consider the wisdom of amending the Usury Law by reducing the maximum rates of interest that can be charged. Considering the importance of credit as an aid to economic enterprise, I request that these proposals, which will be transmitted to you shortly, be given early consideration.\r\nOne of the most pressing needs of the Philippines is develop men with the necessary technological training to supply the needs of modern industry and agriculture. There is likewise great need for men who may assume positions of responsibility in the management of business and industry. I believe that the institution which should be principally expected to supply these men is the University of the Philippines. Hence, I have urged the authorities of the University to propose plans for a reorganization of that institution with a view to raising its standards and placing it on the same level with the best institutions of its kind in the world. Pursuant to my request, the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents is the transfer of the University of the Philippines to a new site. This is considered essential in order that University students may be brought under a more strict and wholesome supervision and control, and the proper spirit and atmosphere may be created on the University campus. Moreover, the physical plant of the University must be enlarged and improved, and suitable laboratories provided, if it is to be enabled to grant adequate professional training, specially in science, demanded by present-day progress. Besides being inconveniently located, the actual site of the University is too small to permit of these improvements. The transfer of the College of Medicine will require the construction of a modern hospital on the new site. At any rate, the Philippine General Hospital is no longer adequate to supply the needs of the growing population of Manila, particularly for free patients, and a new hospital is instantly necessary. This transfer of the University will require a considerable outlay, but I believe that the expenditure will be more than justified if we succeed in our efforts to capacitate that institution to supply the Commonwealth with properly trained professional men, business executives, economists, and scientists. Once reorganized and its standards raised, the University of the Philippines would set a mark for private universities to emulate. Fortunately, the present physical plant of the University will not be wasted. The Government is in dire need of buildings to house several offices and the present buildings of the University can be made adequate for that purpose. It would be highly desirable for the National Assembly to act upon the proposed transfer of the University of the Philippines at this session, so that the Government may consider the availability of the buildings of the University in framing its program of construction for government offices.\r\nHeretofore, the municipal and city governments have had, by law, the responsibility of maintaining all elementary instruction. But in order that the purpose of the Constitution may be accomplished, it has been necessary for the National Government to assume the burden of supporting the primary schools, leaving to the local governments only the maintenance of intermediate instruction. As regards secondary instruction, I recommend that provincial governments be authorized to spend their funds only for vocational high schools and not for academic high schools, which, beginning with the school year 1940-1941, should be maintained on a self-supporting basis. Vocational high schools, however, should continue to receive adequate national aid.\r\nTo properly cope with the problem of public health and sanitation, I desire to recommend the establishment of a Department of Public Health. This is necessary for a more effective coordination of public health administration, the better to insure the protection and care of the health of our people, particularly those in early age. Furthermore, it is desirable that the Department of Public Instruction be placed in a position to devote itself exclusively to the far-reaching problems of education and to give greater impetus to the up building of the character and physique of our youth. The new Department of Public Health should be given administrative supervision over public sanitation, hospitals, asylums, clinics, dispensaries, and other institutions that minister to the health of the people.\r\nIn order to effect an orderly and scientific development of our agriculture and to permit the intelligent planning of agricultural production, it is essential that as soon as possible we undertake an agronomical survey of the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce has completed the soil survey of several provinces. This work should be supplemented and accelerated. This agronomical survey has been recommended by the National Economic Council and the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs. I request that sufficient funds be appropriated to carry out this survey, which should indicate to the Government and to the people the crops adapted to different sections of the country.\r\nAnother recommendation of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs is the establishment of agricultural experiment and extension stations. This is a project which should merit our immediate consideration, if we wish to stimulate agricultural enterprises and modernize agricultural methods. I recommend the repeal of the present law requiring a 5 per cent contribution by provinces and municipalities to the local agricultural fund. Better results could be obtained by a consolidation of these experiment and extension stations in typical areas than by dispersing them, as at present, and often duplicating the experiments, in each province. I recommend an appropriation from the proceeds of the excise taxes of a sufficient amount to cover the expenses for the establishment and operation of these situations in such localities as may be determined by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Another reason which induces me to make this recommendation is the fact that the finances of local governments are inadequate to support this service and that they cannot continue setting aside such a large portion of their revenues for these stations without jeopardizing other activities imperatively needed by local communities.\r\nModern industry and agriculture can not be efficiently operated without the aid of scientific research. This is particularly true in the Philippines where technological science of common knowledge is so far behind other countries. We have secured the advice of a renowned scientist to assist the Government in the establishment of an institution for scientific research. It should serve not only the Government but also private industry and agriculture. I shall submit to the National Assembly appropriate recommendations on this subject as soon as the studies of the National Economic Council and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce are completed.\r\nThe National Economic Council has recommended the establishment of an Institute of Nutrition. In order to protect the health and build up the physique of our masses such an institution is necessary. The people need to be educated on the nutritive value of different food products. There are many wholesome and nutritious articles that are consumed in some sections of the country which are unknown in others. It is also necessary t formulate dietary programs scientifically balanced which shall be within the reach of the people of the most modest means. Once the Institute completes its study of the different food products that could be produced abundantly and cheaply in the Philippines, the Department of Agriculture and Commerce could conduct a campaign for the production of national interests, has agreed with our Government that political refugees who desire to come to the Philippines shall not be given visas by American consuls without the previous approval of our Government. We owe it largely to His Excellency, the United States High Commissioner, that the State Department was fully appraised of the situation and that this administrative policy was adopted.\r\nAt the last session of the First National Assembly I had occasion to express publicly our indebtedness to High Commissioner McNutt for his unstinted cooperation with our Government. I reiterate those sentiments now. It is, therefore, with a sense of great loss for our people and for me that I have heard of his contemplated return to the United States. If he should find it necessary to resign his present post, we would be deprived of a true friend and a most able collaborator, one whom we need at this most critical period and who would be very hard to replace. But if he must leave us, we wish him to know that he takes with him our affection and gratitude, and our prayer that he may succeed in his future undertakings.\r\nTo protect the interests of our people and to repair an injustice done to certain races by existing legislation, we should enact a new immigration law. Under our present immigration law passed by the Congress of the United States, Chinese, Indians, and some other Orientals may not be admitted into the Philippines. Ours is an oriental country, and we are an oriental people. We belong to the same racial stock as some of those excluded by our laws. So long as other foreigners are allowed to immigrate to the Philippines, we should admit, under the same terms and conditions, those coming from oriental countries. To avoid, however, a large influx of immigrants from any one country, we should establish a quota that will be the same for all countries.\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, the world in which we live today is an entirely different world from that which we knew only a few years ago. Whereas before the World War, democracy was gaining ground everywhere, mankind is now divided into two great camps\u2014those who believe in democracy and those who feel contempt for it as a completely discredited system of government. By our political education, by our convictions and by our inclinations, we are a democracy. We have established a democratic system of government and the perpetuation of this system will depend upon our ability to convince our people that democracy can be freed from those vices which have destroyed it in some countries, and that it can be made as efficient as any other system of government known to man. It behooves us; therefore, to prove that through a wise use of democratic processes, the welfare and the safety of the people can be promoted, thus contributing our share to the preservation of democracy in the world.", "title": "The State of the Nation and Important Economic Problems"},

Quezon", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Third Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1938]\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nThe state of the nation remains practically the same as reported in my annual message to your Honorable Body at the beginning of your last regular session on the 16\r\nof October, 1937.\r\nWe are earnestly concerned with social justice. Without a strict application of social justice to all elements of the community, general satisfaction of the people with their government is impossible to achieve. Here, in the just and equitable solution of social problems, is the real test of the sufficiency of democracy to meet present-day conditions of society.\r\nSocial justice involves many and varied questions, such as taxation, wages, land ownership, insurance against accidents and old age, etc.\r\nI desire to direct your attention at this time to one subject only\u2014taxation\u2014which we are solemnly committed to revise in order to place the burden upon those who should and can best carry it.\r\nTaxation is imposed in the interest of the nation: to keep peace and maintain order; to repel invasion; to prove the living conditions of the people; to educate them; to promote agriculture, industry and trade.\r\nThe power to tax may also be used to prevent the accumulation of vast wealth in a few hands. This is not to deny the right of property of the individual, but it is to affirm that this right may be limited by the State when social well-being demands it. The root of the worldwide discontent among peoples, which gave birth to communism in Russia and which has been at the bottom of every revolution of the last forty years, has been the utter disregard by governments of the social purpose of property. Selfish interests have been allowed to dictate government policies affecting social and economic life.\r\nIn the past, taxation has not been concerned with principles of justice and rarely has it been concerned with bettering the people. Rather it has sought only to produce revenues and to place the burdens on the backs of those least able to remonstrate. It has done this by taxes on consumption, on sales, on licenses to engage in business, trade or profession, and by excessive charges on services which should be rendered by the Government and for which only a sufficient charge should be made to cover the cost. Those who rule have not paid their share. They have exempted the wealth they owned and the incomes they enjoyed almost wholly from taxation. This has been true throughout the world. It has been true of the Philippines as well.\r\nOur tax system, unlike our political system, is still a heritage of earlier centuries, out of harmony with those principles which should guide progressive nations today. The Filipino people have one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. That Constitution is built not only on the principle of political equality but also on the added principle of social justice.\r\nIt remains for us to parallel our achievement in the realm of political science by a similar achievement in the realm of economic and social justice.\r\nThe present system of taxation in the Philippines is a source of the greatest injustice from which our people suffer. It may properly be said that our burdens of taxation rest most heavily upon the masses, and very lightly upon the rich. Bearing in mind the income of the rich as compared to the earnings of the labouring class, it is a fact that the richer the taxpayer the less he contributes proportionately to the maintenance of the Government. The picture of the distribution of taxes in the Philippines is this: The wage earner and the small farmer as a class carry most of the burden, then comes the middle class, and lastly the upper class. This wealthy upper class constitutes a very small percentage of our population.\r\nIn your last session you have done away with the one direct tax which was imposed upon the poor in the same amount as upon the rich\u2014 the cedula tax. But even after the elimination of this odious tax which accrued exclusively to the provincial and municipal governments, it is still true that as far as the National Government is concerned, its income comes mostly from customs duties, the tax is ultimately paid by the consumer, and in the case of internal revenue taxes, with very few exceptions, the bulk of the tax is also paid by the consumer. Needless to say, if most of these taxes are paid by the consumer, it is the great mass of the people who are carrying the burden.\r\nThe extent to which the Commonwealth is supported by the great mass of the people through taxes on consumption is not generally realized. Taxes on consumption are of necessity taken almost entirely from the poor. These taxes are added to costs as are all other elements of the cost. Thus, in 1936 the total revenue of the National Government, including the customs, amounted to approximately P85,000,000. Of this sum less than P5,000,000 came from direct taxes on incomes while the total taxes paid by inheritances and wealth amounted to less than P1,000,000. Deducting incidental revenues and other earnings, there remained P52,500,000 in the form of indirect consumption taxes on the things the people used , and for the most part had to use. They were in the form of customs taxes, excise taxes, license taxes, sales taxes, and similar charges.\r\nThe revenues of the provinces and municipalities, excluding contributions from the National Government, amounted to P46,000,000. Except for such taxes on real estate as are ultimately borne by the owners of the real estate, the great bulk of these taxes were consumption taxes or charges on the living costs of the people.\r\nIn other words, approximately P100,000,000 have been taken from fifteen million people not according to their ability to pay but according to their need to exist. This burden is equivalent to possibly P40 per family. And this burden is borne by millions of our people whose total family income is between P100 and P200 a year. There is no escape from the fact that the Commonwealth is supported in large part by those who are already on a low margin of subsistence.\r\nIn forty years\u2019 time we have taken from these classes a sum which approximates the accumulated wealth of the entire Philippines, agricultural as well as industrial. Within the past generation these consumption taxes have rebuilt the Commonwealth. They gave us our docks and harbours, our streets and highways, our schools and public buildings. The taxes from the poor have in fact made possible the Commonwealth which we now enjoy. It is their contributions that have given us security. They have paid for our courts of justice. They have preserved our health. They are maintaining our military establishments. They have made the Philippines a safe and comfortable place in which to dwell. It is the centavos of the millions that have created the conditions which have made our industries possible. Almost alone the masses have built the Commonwealth by their sacrifices. This has been going on for more than three hundred years. It is a system which we inherited from Old Europe, in which a few enjoyed all the privileges while the people did the work and also paid for the support of the state.\r\nIt is not social justice alone, it is ordinary justice that demands correction of this age-long injustice.\r\nWhile in the case of the customs duties, we are not free at this time to introduce radical or even any important change in our laws, we are not placed in the same position with reference to the internal-revenue taxes. We must proceed at once to reduce and, whenever possible, to eliminate altogether, every internal-revenue tax which is passed on ultimately to the consumer, such for instance as the sales tax. The sales tax is not paid by the merchant but by the public who buys the articles for its consumption. The merchants, in paying the sales tax of 11 per cent for every sale that they make, no matter how many times, are only acting as collectors for the Government, and the real person who pays the tax is the last purchaser, the consumer. The sales tax, moreover, is not only unjust to the poor; it also is injurious to the healthy growth of business. There are historian-economists who attribute the ruin of Spanish industries in the sixteenth century to the sales tax. In the United States, the Federal Government imposes no sales tax, and only a certain number of States impose it. But regardless of how other governments secure their revenues, it remains true nevertheless that the sales tax is unfair to the poor and harmful to the business. I, therefore, recommend the amendment of the sales tax law so as to eliminate completely the sales tax on every article that is of prime necessity and leave it only for luxuries, in which case, the tax should be materially increased. However, in no case should the sales tax be cumulative, but rather it should be paid only once at the source.\r\nAnother advantage to the Government in the amendment of the sales tax law as suggested is that there can be no evasion of the payment of the tax as in the past. Nor will there be any need for a large number of internal-revenue collectors and inspectors who, in the performance of their duties, are unavoidably causing annoyance and irritation especially among the small merchants. Many small merchants, insufficiently trained to handle complicated accounts, waste time and energy in keeping their sales books in order. I am sure that the relief which thousands and thousands of small merchants all over the Philippines will receive from the abolition of the cumulative sales tax and of any tax on articles of prime necessity, will in itself compensate, in terms of satisfaction with their Government, for the loss, if any, that the treasury may suffer. I believe, too, that it is in part due to the difficulties that the average small Filipino merchant finds in keeping his books and paying his books and paying his sales tax that the retail trade is not largely in Filipino hands. It is my hope and belief that the abolition of the sales tax will encourage and facilitate the entry of more Filipinos with little capital into the retail business.\r\nThere are other internal-revenue taxes that should be abolished or amended, such for instance as the license fees on the various professions. It is evidently unfair that a new lawyer or anew doctor should be made to pay the same amount of license as those most experienced and accredited in the profession they are paying. If it is the preference to keep this tax, at least there should be an exemption for those who have not been in the profession more than five years. In order that the Government may have a record of these practicing professionals, they may be compelled to pay only what is necessary to defray the cost of keeping that record.\r\nThere are still other taxes on our cultural life that should be repealed or very materially reduced. One of these is the tax on radio sets which should not exceed P1 a year, except in the case of expensive sets which are luxuries. The radio should be available to every family. It is a means of political contact with their Government. It is a carrier of news, by which the people may be informed as to what is going on in the world. Through the radio adult education is possible. Through it, music and drama can be disseminated in every barrio. By means of the radio, police administration is made easier, and property and life made more secure. To tax such an instrument by an almost prohibitive charge to the poor is as indefensible as a prohibitive tax on the daily press.\r\nIn the case of the market licenses, I recommend that the National Assembly enact a law prohibiting the municipalities from collecting market and slaughterhouse fees in excess of what is necessary to pay for their maintenance and upkeep. If, however, the municipality is still in debt for the construction of its market, it may be permitted, if deemed necessary, to collect higher taxes only until such cost has been fully recovered.\r\nThe foregoing recommendations will mean a serious reduction in the income of the Government which we cannot afford to leave uncovered. Fortunately, there are many sources from which we can raise new taxes without causing any injustice to those who will have to pay, for we must see to it that these new taxes are just and fair, that they do not discourage initiative in sound business enterprises. Indeed, my very recommendation that the sales tax and licenses be done away with is in line with our purpose not to allow taxation to retard the proper economic development of the country nor to jeopardize the confidence of business in us.\r\nIn your first regular session, you passed an act increasing the rates of our income tax, but the most cursory examination of the income tax paid in the Philippines both by corporations and individuals as compared with the income tax paid in other countries shows that we are practically imposing a nominal income tax. The United States is not the country that imposes the highest income tax, yet as compared with America, the income tax in the Philippines is but a trifle. Following is a comparative statement of the rates of income tax levied in the United States and in the Philippines.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that besides the income tax which corporations and individuals in the United States pay to their Federal Government, they still have to pay income tax to their respective States. In the Philippines, however, the income tax is paid only to the National Government.\r\nI advise against raising the income tax in the Philippines to anything near what is being collected in the United States. We are in the formative period of our national economy and we should not discourage the investment of capital. But we must increase the income tax because it is inexcusably low. Moreover, this is the time to adopt the policy of avoiding the accumulation of enormous wealth in a few hands and to force the return of excessive income to the public through the medium of government services supported by these taxes. It is in the case of corporations. Inheritance and income taxes that the Government must bear in mind the need of reverting to the nation large amounts of wealth that may be accumulated in a few hands. From the increase collections accruing to the National Government from the additional income tax that we contemplate imposing, an adequate proportion should be set aside for the provincial and municipal governments.\r\nIt is my firm belief that if the recommendations made in this message are carried out by the National Assembly, we shall have gone far in our efforts to lay down the foundations of a nation wherein each citizen will contribute his part in the maintenance of the Government in proportion to his ability or resources. As we reduce the burden that is being unduly placed upon the masses of our people, on the one hand, and give them the wage that they are entitled to earn, on the other, we shall ultimately raise the standard of living as we reduce its cost, and thereby increase the purchasing power of the wage earner.\r\nWe are liable to forget the fact that the business of the country does not come from great incomes that a few individuals residing in that country make, but from the earning power of the masses.\r\nI hope that this Honorable Body will enact the laws herein recommended early in this session. We have talked enough of social justice. Even the walls have heard our speeches. We have made a good start. We have raised the wages of all government labourers. We have abolished the cedula tax. But we have not done enough. We have only begun. Now we are fully prepared to act and we must act at once, if our people are to continue placing their confidence for the remedy of the social evils which embitter their life entirely in our hands. The last general elections have proven beyond question that the people have wholeheartedly and enthusiastically approved of our avowed policies. The City of Manila, which, like every large city in the world, is usually in the opposition by large majorities, has voted practically for the whole Nacionalista ticket, the election of two councillors from the opposition being purely a vote for the individual rather than for the party to which each belongs. As for the rest of the country, all the newly elected governors are Nacionalistas; only one or two provincial board members and an occasional mayor belong to the opposition.\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly: The time to act is now. Deeds and not words is what our people want. We dare not disappoint them.", "title": "Revision of the System of Taxation"},

I am here today to start the job with you.\r\nWhat do our people want?\r\nWhen our people cast their ballots in the recent election, they voted primarily for a great, sweeping change. They voted to throw out dishonesty, inefficiency, and waste. And they voted for a government that would act boldly and effectively, to banish insecurity and fear, poverty and want.\r\nWe promised all these things. The people voted for them. Now we must keep faith.\r\nOur first step must be to take an inventory of the nation, to define our problems, and to set our goals.\r\nLet us turn first to the security of the nation, which must be our prime concern.\r\nI must warn against complacency. Communist imperialism still threatens us from without and from within.\r\n.\r\nExternally, the creeping advance of Communism continues in Southeast Asia despite the truce in Korea.\r\nWe must, therefore, move to strengthen our defenses.\u00a0 It is clearly in the national interest that we meet with the representatives of the United States Government to settle pending legal questions so that the bases we have granted to that. country can be immediately developed and fully activated.\r\nInternally, the absence of major armed conflicts in dissident areas does not necessarily mean that the Huks have ceased to be a threat. They are still trying to undermine the Government, not with as much open defiance as before, but slyly and secretly.\r\nAgainst this conspiracy we will continue our policy of \u201call-out friendship and all-out force.\u201d I say again what I have said many times before: we will give every dissident who surrenders new opportunities for decent livelihood, but we will smash those who would overthrow our independent democracy in order to hand it over to an alien dictatorship.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we will employ the manpower and resources of our .Armed Forces to combat not only dissidence but also the causes which breed dissidence. Troops and trainees of the Armed Forces will be mobilized for the construction of public works and economic development projects, as far as this may be compatible with their primary mission and with economy of operation. This will achieve a double purpose: to give these citizens training in useful and technical pursuits, and to help in the material progress of the nation.\r\nThe existing civilian agency charged with resettlement work, the Land Settlement Development Company (LASEDECO), is in such a state of disorganization and disorder, that it may be more convenient to liquidate and replace it than to reorganize it.\u00a0\u00a0 I am afraid, however, that it will take some time before we can set up a new and effective agency, and I would suggest that the Engineer Development Corps (EDCOR) be expanded and utilized to help not only surrendered Huks but also those landless Filipinos who have remained loyal.\r\nAs much as the finances of the Government will permit, we should also buy large estates for resale to small farmers on liberal terms.\r\nIn order to encourage agricultural production and eliminate in absentee-landlordism, I propose that Congress study the advisability of imposing special taxes on lands left uncultivated for an unreasonably long period and without justifiable cause.\r\nOur laws on land registration and the disposition of public lands should be revised.\u00a0 We should make it easier for our people to get land of their own, free from any nagging technical doubts.\r\nThe Government should extend greater protection to\u00b7 tenants who, because of ignorance or illiteracy, are often badly in need of advice with respect to their rights, especially in the liquidation of their harvests with the landlords. I urge Congress to strengthen the legal staff entrusted with the specific task of rendering this kind of assistance.\r\nExisting legislation on tenancy relations is confusing.\r\nThere are too many laws in too many books. We need a single, concise, and easily understood\u00a0 farm tenancy code.\r\nOur small farmers and producers should find it easier to borrow money when they need it to increase production. This means more rural banks and more ample working capital for the Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA). Producers\u2019 cooperatives should also be properly organized and financed.\r\nOur ultimate goal is to reshape land tenure system in our country in such a way as to build a strong nation of small, independent, and contended farm owners, free from want, protected from injustice, and eager to contribute their share to the welfare and progress of the nation.\r\nBut our people must realize that individually, as well as nationally, we must help ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The fundamental difficulty is that our farmers and workers do not earn enough money, largely because they have not been trained to work efficiently. We must extend the present facilities to educate our farmers in modern agricultural methods, such as the use of fertilizers, mechanical equipment seed selection, soil conservation, crop rotation, and other means to improve agricultural yields.\r\nWe should do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area and improve the quality of our export products in order to place us in a better position to compete with other suppliers of the world markets.\r\nThe attainment of sufficiency in rice production and distribution is one of our major goals. We shall hasten the construction of more irrigation systems and encourage efforts to increase rice production yields, and at the same time take measures to bring the price of rice clown to the reach of the common man.\r\nThe development of cottage industries must be an integral part of our industrial program, not only to produce goods but also to help supplement the low income of our people in the barrios.\r\nIn many areas our farmers are harassed by destructive plant pests and diseases. We should help them fight the cadang-cadang disease in the coconut regions, control mosaic disease in abaca, and eradicate rat infection. I trust Congress will provide sufficient funds to finance research and control work on these diseases and pests now threatening our major crops.\r\nAs I have often pointed out, our barrio people do not even have safe water to drink. I must ask your fullest support for the administration\u2019s program of building waterworks and artesian wells all over the country.\r\nCivic-spirited members of our community, particularly the Lions Club and the Liberty Wells Association, have spontaneously taken up the challenge to provide our people with artesian wells. I know you will not do less.\r\nI would also ask Congress to study the feasibility of granting subsidies as a means of encouraging doctors and nurses to establish themselves in those remote areas which now lack essential medical and health services. We must have a healthy manpower as the most essential factor for economic advancement. No nation can go forward when it is crippled by disease.\r\nThe Social Welfare Administration has mapped out a definite program of self-help projects designed to put needy individuals back on their feet. It will also cooperate actively in the settlement program and send social workers to the barrios to carry out rural improvement projects.\r\n\r\nIn the industrial centers of population this administration is committed to help labor attain maturity so that it may assume its place of responsibility side by side with management. Under my administration, I will not countenance any attempt on the part of the Government or any of its officials to dominate or influence the labor unions.\r\nWe will encourage free unionism under responsible, enlightened leadership truly dedicated to the welfare of the laboring masses. But I warn those unscrupulous individuals who would use the labor movement to exploit the workers that their activities will not go unpunished. We will be equally hard with interference by management in labor union activities.\r\n\r\nWhat we need above all is a coordinated plan, theoretically sound and practically feasible, to increase the national production and provide opportunities for more jobs and higher incomes for our people, particularly in the rural areas. In the past, such programs have not made adequate progress because of ineffective implementation and insufficient support.\r\nI recommend that the National Economic Council be revitalized as a really effective agency to plan and put into effect a truly integrated program for economic development.\r\nGovernment corporations have been created purportedly for this purpose, but they failed to achieve their objective because they were manned by incompetent or dishonest officials, because they were diverted from their original functions, or because they were unwisely expanded. I have ordered an inquiry into the operations and activities of these corporations, and in due time, I will submit to Congress appropriate recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe Government will henceforth confine itself to those phases of development where its participation is absolutely essential to the public welfare.\r\nPrivate capital, from sources both at home and abroad, will be preferred to direct government financing, whenever possible.\r\nI hope that our own people will go into new ventures and take full advantage of the incentives now and to be provided by our Government. These economic pioneers deserve our support.\r\nWe also welcome foreign capital, assuring it fair treatment. In the past it was perhaps discouraged by the uncertainty of our attitude, and I propose that we mark out clearly a stable basis on which foreign investors can put their capital to work in this country.\r\nMy administration is pledged to the eventual elimination of controls. I propose to achieve this gradually as the development of domestic industry and trade renders controls unnecessary. In the meantime, we shall have to maintain them to conserve our financial resources and to channel them to fundamental development activities. Controls will be administered honestly, fairly, and efficiently. We will not permit any government official or employee to utilize them for private gain.\r\n\r\nThe joint Philippine-American program of self-help, designed to assist our country\u2019s economic development, merits our vigorous support. Together with the representatives of the Foreign Operations Administration, we are now considering ways and means to speed up the assistance program, in our mutual desire to bring its benefits to our people at the earliest possible time. I trust that Congress will provide adequate counterpart funds. We shall also explore other programs of economic cooperation with nations in Asia and with the United Nations.\r\nMost vital to our internal growth and development, however, is our trade relationship with the United States. Our Government has asked for a re-examination of the Bell Trade Act in the earnest belief that the situation in which it was originally considered and drafted has changed, and that a new situation has arisen which calls for a new arrangement. We are confident that the Government and people of the United States will not look upon our proposals with indifference.\r\nPending the outcome of those negotiations, we must be prepared to adjust ourselves to new conditions.\r\nIt is my desire, as well as that of the Vice-President, that our foreign policy serve the economic needs of our people. Consequently, new emphasis will be placed on the promotion of foreign trade as one of our primary objectives. Our foreign service will everywhere have the new mission of contributing directly to the economic stability and expanding trade of our people.\r\nAs a good neighbor to the countries of Southeast Asia, we shall participate in all regional activities that will promote closer economic and cultural relations among us.\u00a0 We have ties with European countries, and, through our Spanish heritage, with the Spanish-American republics. We shall strive to establish mutually beneficial commercial relations with them.\r\nThe restoration of normal relations with Japan through an early\u2019 settlement of the reparations issue should open another avenue of prosperous intercourse.\r\n\r\nOur principal difficulty, however, is money. Our General Fund deficit, as of June 30, 1953, was P124,900,000. Incomplete data on operations for the six-month period ending December 31, 1953, indicate a further deficit. There are obligations unrecorded in. the books amounting to P99,700,000.\u00a0 The General Fund owes the various special funds P17,000,000.\r\nOur public, debt, as of September 30, 1953, was P1,070,740,782,79. This figure includes the extraordinary advance of P200,000,000 from the Central Bank for economic rehabilitation and development, all of which has been released;\u00a0 P550,000,000 in backpay obligations; and P178,400,000 in various budgetary loans.\u00a0 All these obligations have to be liquidated out of general fund receipts.\u00a0 If we consider that the average annual income of the Government was less than P600.000.000 in the past, we will readily see that we have a problem of the first magnitude.\r\nWe must, therefore, maintain our existing sources of revenue, and discover ways and means of increasing government income without creating new tax burdens.\u00a0 I am constrained to request Congress to extend the tax laws which have expired, or are to expire, this year. Our failure to do so would mean a loss of about P150,000,000 in revenues, which will impair essential public services.\r\nThe honest, realistic, and really economical way to run this Government is to collect the present taxes efficiently, intensively. We must go after tax evaders without favoritism and drive home the lesson on that they deserve no mercy. To this end, I recommend that Congress make the penalties for tax evasion more severe. These increased penalties should take effect after a fixed date, up to which tax evaders or delinquents should be given a chance to settle their obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 After the deadline, no compromises should be entertained and the law should be enforced to the letter.\r\nOn the other hand, we must tighten our purse strings.\u00a0\u00a0 We must abandon the practice of authorizing appropriations far in excess of funds actually in the treasury and those reasonably anticipated.\r\nI recommend that Congress make a distinction between expenses needed to run the government and render essential public services, and those expenses which are really capital investments.\r\nThe ordinary operational expenses should never exceed the total revenues in any fiscal year. We must live within our means.\u00a0 We should not try to balance our budget with loans, as we have tried to do in the past. We must support ourselves.\r\nThis does not mean, however, that we are opposed to the financing of capital expenditures to increase production and provide public works, through public borrowing.\u00a0 Capital expenditures of this type should be regarded as investments in the future economic stability and security of our country.\r\n\r\nIn great part these investments take the form of public works projects.\u00a0 Politics often dictated when, where, and for how much such projects would be undertaken.\u00a0\u00a0 Much money and effort went to waste that way.\r\nPublic necessity should now be our criterion.\u00a0\u00a0 Our needs are great but our resources are small. This calls for careful planning, intelligent selection, and consistent and economical implementation of projects.\r\nI am for the adoption of a public works program that will bring the benefits of democracy to the nipa huts of the poor. All too often our small farmers have to carry their products to market on their backs because we have neglected barrio roads. These, in turn, would not be fully effective unless they feed a system of national highways.\u00a0 Our aim would be to make them consist principally of concrete pavements financed through public borrowing, to be serviced from the Highway Fund. The large first cost of this undertaking will be more than compensated in the form of reduced road maintenance and vehicular operational costs.\r\nIn the past, our attempts to provide our children with adequate school buildings have been half-hearted, piecemeal.\u00a0 We should now consider a school building program on a national scale.\u00a0 I propose the manufacture of prefabricated buildings in plants located in strategic places, from which buildings can be transported to the remotest barrios, where they will he installed with the help of the people themselves. A more rapid pace of school building construction is needed, if we are to accommodate the large number of children coming of school age every year.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us consider the moral state of the nation. There is little in the immediate past of which we may be proud. Since the change of administration, we have unearthed one case after another of outrageous corruption, abuse of power, and manipulation of the laws for self-enrichment.\u00a0 The sordid record is just beginning to unfold. I fear that further inquiry will yield even uglier facts.\r\nWhat, we have been asked, are we going to do about all this?\r\nWe must, first of all, remove unworthy government officials and employees.\u00a0\u00a0 Where the evidence so warrants, we will prosecute those who justly deserve prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only considerations of morale and discipline but also the very progress of our work make this demand upon us.\u00b7 We shall not be able to move ahead for as long as those entrusted with the promotion of the public welfare are busy exploring and exploiting opportunities for selfish ends. We simply cannot tolerate such men in the government. They must go.\r\nI wish to make clear that the spirit of justice, not of persecution, will guide us in this undertaking.\u00a0 The innocent, the honest and the efficient need fear nothing from us.\u00a0\u00a0 This Government will protect and defend their rights by enforcing impartially and without political bias our civil service rules and regulations.\u00a0 In the Executive Department, I will not permit anyone to exact political vengeance on honest and efficient employees by dismissing them without cause or harassing them in any other way.\u00a0 The victory we have won is not a license for political persecution.\r\nTo guide us in the conduct of public business, we must return to the timeless moral and political principles which we have either forgotten or taken for granted. There is the principle that honesty is the best policy in public as well as in private life. There is the principle that, while politics is indispensable for the workings of democracy, it cannot be superior to the interest of the nation.\r\nIn the effort to secure for ourselves and our children a government of integrity and efficiency, I will welcome whatever legislation may be enacted by Congress that will serve to prevent, deter; and discourage corruption, increase the penalty for malfeasance in office, and lay down definite rules of ethical conduct in government.\r\nIn the last few years there has been a decline of morality.\u00a0\u00a0 Character building alone, without a solid moral foundation, has been found inadequate in developing a sound citizenry. We should improve and strengthen the implementation of the Constitutional provision on optional religious instruction through practical and just measures.\r\nI shall address to the Congress on another occasion\u00a0 a special message on the problems of students who have proved their right to participate in public affairs, as well as on the need to stimulate and foster the growth of our native culture among our youth.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the problems that we are committed to solve. To be sure, many more will arise in the course of this administration. But I sincerely believe that solutions to them will be found, just as I am confident that we\u00b7 shall be able to dispose of the difficult business at hand.\r\nI must remind you of an all-important fact: that what we have set out to do can be realized only through concerted action and unity. More than ever, we must think, plan, and work as one, with only one supreme goal in mind-the promotion of the welfare and happiness of our people.\r\nPerhaps you will say that the people are asking for a miracle. But they too performed no less than a miracle when in one great irresistible movement they dared every peril to preserve the right to have a government of their choice. Thus, they proved to the whole world, to our friends and enemies, that democracy has come of age in our land, that it has become truly and actively a part of the Filipino way of life.\r\nWe have pledged to enrich that life.\u00a0\u00a0 We can do it.\u00a0 We must do it. With the aid of Divine Providence, we shall\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0begin and continue the work until we shall have fulfilled the great promise that gave our people strength to prove themselves worthy of their heritage of freedom.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1952-01-28 10:52:42+00:00", "author": "Elpidio Quirino", "text": "[Released on January 28, 1952]\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER,\r\nMEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nI welcome you once again as you begin this third session of the Second Congress. I welcome, especially, the dis\u00adtinguished new members of the Senate. Our people have willed that the ranks of the opposition be bolstered. The fiscalizing mission of the minority will thus have greater opportunity of accomplishment. It is my hope that in such a task it will be as fruitfully effective as it should be patriot\u00adically cooperative, ever mindful of our joint responsibility to keep this nation always unified. The institutions which we have built and the Republic which we have erected belong to us, one and all, for us to honor and protect.\r\nThe age in which we live and the international associa\u00adtion with which we chose to be identified make us conscious in every phase of our lives that we have a country to de\u00adfend, to develop for our people\u2019s welfare, and to strengthen as a bastion for internal peace and for the peace of the world.\r\nThe facts of history require us to consider under the present world set-up that, while there are still leading nations, no longer are there big and small nations apart from one another. We are divided into groups, practi\u00adcally into two major groups\u2014one believing in a world order under the theory of enslavement by a dominating power, the other under the theory of co-existence based upon the collective authority of free democratic govern\u00adments. The former fosters chaos and confusion to gain adherents, the latter develops the spirit of self-help to strengthen each unit as a composite integral part of a world organization dedicated to universal peace.\r\nYou and I, regardless of party alignments, have but one purpose: to seek the welfare and happiness of our people. In serving them, often we have had different points of view. We shall perhaps differ time and again in approach and in procedure, but never in fundamentals. Differences are sal\u00adutary when born out of individual freedom\u2014of thought and action, and restrained by unity of purpose\u2014love and soli\u00addarity of our fellow countrymen. Provided we always keep in mind, as we did in the last sessions of the Congress, that all we, each of us, are trying to do, is to contribute our utmost in promoting the safety and well-being of our people, democracy will flourish as a vital dominating force in our national life.\r\nWe showed this in our last popular experiment. Whatever the consequences to us politically, we secured the free and untrammelled expression of the people\u2019s will, for only on the rock of democracy can we build a free Philippines.\r\nTo build it required centuries of sacrifice in blood and treasure. Layer by layer, stone on stone, on the bones and ashes of those who preceded us, each generation in its epoch and in its regime left the sediment of its labor and influence to give us the country that is ours today. Thus, whatever we have at this hour, everything that we enjoy, did not come about full-grown overnight, is not solely the work of today. It is the result of a continuing process, as each, in his time, contributes his genius and vision as well as his sweat and sinew to leave to those who follow a country better than he found it, winning for it with each passing year a growing measure of admiration and respect.\r\nAnd as we look back and realize the vicissitudes and mis\u00adfortunes that have been our people\u2019s lot in the recent past, devastated and torn to pieces as we were, it should give us renewed courage that not only did we survive, but that we survived with dignity and honor.\r\nToday, this our epoch is one of economic and political survival, of internal and external security. How did we reach it? I shall now report on how we have been con\u00adtributing our modest share in the last three or four years and dwell on the important phases of our national life and the processes which led us to the status we now enjoy.\r\nBut before doing so, allow me to review in brief retrospect our struggle for survival. You will recall that when we reconstituted the Commonwealth Government in 1945, we had an economy left prostrate by the war. We did not have the revenues needed to finance the normal functions of government. We had to seek relief and assistance from the United States to supplement the meager P36,000,000 available in the General Fund. Relief and assistance were granted us in various forms: in foodstuffs, clothing, other relief goods of all kinds, surplus equipment and supplies of the United States forces in the Philippines, and cash in the form of war damage payments, pensions, gratuities, and grants and loans.\r\nOur people, denied of even the essentials during the Japanese occupation, reacted to this sudden flow of help by spending much too freely for their own good. At the same time, loose firearms in the hands of people who helped us in our liberation abound everywhere; still trigger-happy, many individuals organized themselves into bands, enjoying as well as endangering life in the outlying districts, and even in our midst, at the point of the gun. This fact as well as the moral trauma resultant of the war and vestigial inequalities rooted in centuries of servitude unfortunately led unscrupulous and misguided people to graft and corrup\u00adtion, to disorder, and gradually to dissidence.\r\nThus, when we entered upon the first phase of this administration, which was merely a continuation of the Roxas regime cut short by the demise in 1948 of our dear friend, President Roxas, we were faced with two great problems: the maintenance of peace and order and the strengthening of the confidence of the people in their gov\u00adernment\u2014both of which occupied my mind upon my assump\u00adtion of office. This brief but painful interlude in our political odyssey aroused fear and distrust both here and abroad. Our first step was to purge the government of dishonest officials. We ordered the investigation of the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (PRRA) and later the Surplus Property Commission, which were the foci of infection. The investigation of the first brought forth negligible results, but the investigation of the second resulted in the dismissal, prosecution, and conviction of many of its personnel. The investigation was extended to other branches of the government and, similarly, other dismissals, prosecutions, and convictions were the result.\r\nSimultaneously, we directed our attention to the suppression of banditry and dissidence, offering to the latter amnesty which shortly thereafter\u2014not through the fault of the government\u2014was repudiated. But we were not discouraged and continued unabated our moral crusade and campaign for peace and order. These problems became more complicated as internal discontent, disturbance, and insecurity increased. As if these were not enough, the clamor for back pay and the murmurings of rice crisis and recurrent school crisis harassed us. On top of these came the grave problems affecting our external security. We were poor, deep in debt, assailed and embarrassed in our struggle for stability. And we were drawn into a struggle not only for our national survival, but also for that of democracy in a world rent by an ideological warfare that had congealed into a cold war.\r\nWe had to reorganize and strengthen our armed forces to cope with the increasingly grave situation. We intensified our peace and order campaign, adopting new methods of dealing with the local foe as we prepared to face him in Korea.\r\nThe large gains made in the campaign this past year are now of public knowledge, and given due recognition here and abroad. We still have elements inspired from abroad plotting unlawful seizure of governmental power, constantly seeking \u201cto undermine the land of their birth in the interest of the land of their ideology.\u201d They were in a fair way to accomplishing their nefarious plans but for the systematic and determined action by the defense forces of the Republic which not only nullified and frustrated, but also dispersed these covert elements and disrupted their time-table. With excellent intelligence work we were able to round up the \u00admembers of their politburo and secured their prosecution and conviction. There are now more surrenderees than captives or Huk casualties; many of them are settled in government farms with their families, awaiting the routine process to make their present landholdings their own. By a more intensive follow-up in our campaign and more extensive realization of our program of constructive attraction, we hope to achieve the permanent eradication of the threat that the subverters posed.\r\nI must apprise you of the fact that the operations to re\u00adstore peace have not been without their cost. The casualty total is roughly 900, with 350 killed and 550 wounded. There are approximately 1,500 men in our army hospitals. For those who unselfishly and heroically gave their lives, for their widows and orphans, I bespeak your heartfelt support and assistance.\r\nI wish, in solemn gratification, to stress the record of cour\u00adage and heroism of our troops in Korea. They have covered themselves with glory and made every Filipino proud. Through their sacrifices we are giving our stint in the epic fight for freedom and peace.\r\nOur country saw during the past year a remarkable improvement in its general economic condition. A co\u00adordinated set of remedial measures in the monetary, fiscal, and production fields, together with improvements in administrative organization, and in the peace and order condition, dispelled almost overnight the despondency and irrational apprehension that seemed to have caught hold of business and or productive segments of the agricultural population. General confidence increased and with it came a new resolve on the part of our people to make this land a haven of peace and prosperity for the coming generations.\r\nStimulated by favorable international prices after the outbreak of the Korean War, the production of our ex\u00adport industries expanded. This favorable turn of events together with the strict conservation measures adopted during 1950 enabled us to raise substantially the level of our international reserve and to introduce a series of measures, which had the immediate welcome effect of temporarily liberalizing the control over imports.\r\nThe psychological effect of these measures as well as the substantial amounts or goods that came during 1951 were two of the main influences that pulled down prices to levels more consistent with the income earned by the great mass of our people.\r\nContributing in no small degree to the restoration of stability in internal prices were the measures taken to\u00adwards the end of 1950 and during 1951 to increase the revenue of the government. All these efforts were com\u00adplemented by a restrictive credit policy on the part of banking institutions which brought about a further reduction in the money supply.\r\nAs a result of these measures, the cost of living which rose from June 1950 for a year has dropped substantially since. Meanwhile, production improved greatly not only in the export industries but in other fields, especially mining and manufacturing. The index on the physical volume of production has risen from 97.5 in 1950 to 107.1 in 1951, with 1937 as a base. There is more manufacturing activity going on now than ever before in the history of this coun\u00adtry. National income for 1951 was P5,120,000,000 as against P4,608,000,000 in 1950. This rapid increase in pro\u00adductive activity reflects considerable new investment, both foreign and domestic, in plants and equipment which would not have been made had there been no restoration of con\u00adfidence in the future progress and stability of this country. Inquiries from parties\u2019 abroad contemplating investment of capital in the Philippines have been on the increase, and our economic recovery has been the subject of favorable comments on the part of many competent observers abroad.\r\nSeveral of the basic development projects that the gov\u00adernment has financed are in advanced stages of construction. The power projects, such as the Lumot Diversion Project, already completed, the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric Power and Fertilizer plants both to be completed at the end of this year, and the Ambuklao Hydroelectric Power Projects, now also under construction, will give a tremen\u00addous boost not only to industrial development but also to a more diversified rural economy. The funds provided for the construction of irrigation projects and the purchase of fertilizers give further assurance of our steady march to\u00adward the attainment of self-sufficiency in food crops, espe\u00adcially rice. The construction of additional textile mills such as the one now in operation in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, represents the beginning of an effort on our part to reduce this country\u2019s dependence on outside sources for one of the elemental necessities of life.\r\nThe immediate result of the economic measures we have adopted during the past year and a half is to preserve for our people the real value of their worldly possessions. The inflation in prices has been not only arrested but rolled back, thus restoring especially to the lower income brackets the real goods and services that they could claim with their money income. The operation of the minimum wage and tax laws implemented last year brought about a wider and more equitable distribution of the money income in the economy as a whole. Together with the reduction in price levels, these measures could be expected to bring about a permanent improvement in the welfare of our people.\r\nOur international economic relations and prestige have also improved as a result of the change for the better in our domestic situation. The regard in which the Philip\u00adpine peso is held in international markets today is so much higher than a year ago. No longer is its value doubted. It is regarded as one of the most stable in the world. Thus, our ability as an independent and sovereign people to manage our own economic affairs is no longer underrated.\r\nOur record in the field or fiscal policy in the past year is worth underscoring. It is well known that government finances have been severely strained during these postwar years due to the mounting expenditures for defense and peace and order, for public instruction to keep abreast of the increasing school population, for the reconstruction of war-damaged facilities, for the rehabilitation of government corporations, and for reactivating services paralyzed during the last war. The time since liberation has been too short for the country to recover from the ravages of the war. Consequently the national economy could not yield sufficient revenue from taxes or other sources to meet not only current irreducible expenditures but also extraordinary expenditures for economic rehabilitation and development and for various urgent social services.\r\nThe seriousness of the situation at the end of 1950 was such that in my Message to the Congress on January 22, 1951, I said that 1951 was a year exceptionally heavy with decision and destiny; that your actuations during your sec\u00adond regular session might spell the difference between irre\u00adparable disaster and survival to our country.\r\nIt reflects creditably on the patriotism of the members of the Congress that you proved equal to the situation. Under the most adverse conditions, you approved revenue measures that enabled the country to cope with the emer\u00adgency. Never before have our revenues been as high as they are in the current fiscal year. I shall deal on this subject in greater detail in my budget message.\r\nFor the time being, I am particularly happy to report that during this period we were able to complete the final payment on all pre-1934 dollar-bonded indebtedness in the United States, We are on the way to liquidating the ad\u00advances from the fiduciary and special funds. For some time now we have not borrowed from the banks for bud\u00adgetary purposes. We have resumed paying some of our sinking fund obligations including the first installment on the loan secured from the United States Treasury. And we have been able successfully to convert, after paying an amortization and interest of P7.1 million, our $60 million loan with the United States Reconstruction Finance Cor\u00adporation from a two-year into a ten-year loan payable in equal twenty semi-annual installments starting January, 1952.\r\nWith this improvement in our financial climate, the gov\u00adernment of the United States began the implementation in this country of the program of economic assistance promised in the Quirino-Foster Agreement. ECA aid began flowing into our economy in the form of fertilizers, irrigation pumps, grants for the rehabilitation of agricultural colleges and the establishment of experimental stations and extension serv\u00adices, eradication of plant diseases, land survey and road building programs in Mindanao and other areas, public health promotion, survey of basic mineral resources, and promotion of cottage industries. It is our hope that in the coming months, this flow of assistance will continue to increase in volume, for there is no doubt that it will accelerate our progress towards a higher level of production.\r\nBut while we are perhaps entitled to take pride in these substantial achievements, we cannot relax in our efforts to put this country on a truly stable economic basis. There is much still that remains to be done. The discipline that we have had to impose on ourselves over the past years cannot as yet be relaxed. The last two years have given us some time to acquire valuable administrative experience in the operation of economic controls. The maintenance of these controls is still necessary for the public welfare. They can only be removed after the necessary adjustments have been made in our international economic relations. It is vital that we review our trade agreement with the United States, in order that it may be placed on a more equitable basis, in keeping with present-day circumstances in both countries. A readjustment is essential to our achievement of a more stable and balanced economy.\r\nWhile it is true that we have attained a measure of finan\u00adcial stability in the domestic as well as in the international field, it is still necessary for us to continue exercising dis\u00adcretion and vigilance in the expenditures not only of public but also of private resources. We must at times re\u00admember that our financial resources are limited and that the greatest care is needed to insure their use in the most efficient manner possible. Having committed ourselves to a policy of economic development as the only solution to the problem of poverty and under-production, we must mobilize all our resources and exercise the greatest care in their investment. While the assistance of our friend and ally, the United States, would materially accelerate this process, only our own resources can support it on a permanent basis. Fundamentally, the spirit behind the ECA aid is develop\u00adment through self-help. Only by showing this spirit can we expect more substantial help than what we have heretofore received. ECA is not manna or a substitute for dole, much less a premium to complacency.\r\nAnd while we were able to bring down prices substan\u00adtially, our vigil over inflation is far from over. We are fortunate that while the great nations of the world are engulfed in an inflationary wave under the impact of huge military programs, we here in the Philippines have controlled it and have prevented its running away with our earthly possessions. We must keep it controlled by limiting our ex\u00adpenditures to truly essential purposes and well within the revenues which we are capable of producing.\r\nWe have established a group of governmental activities which deal with the satisfaction of the basic needs of our citizenry. Our people ask for little after their need for security-the security of their person, their property, and their freedom,-has been vouchsafed to them. But our government as any other present-day government has gone further. We have endeavored to assist the citizen in his efforts to build up a small competence for himself and his dependents. We have therefore emphasized the administra\u00adtion of the public resources in a manner to provide work and earning opportunities for the citizen to secure him food, shelter, and clothing, as well as, if possible, a modicum of sustenance and comfort in sickness and old age.\r\nWe have constantly been improving the pay of those who occupy the common ranks of both public and private employment. This past year we passed the minimum wage law. But it will perhaps be necessary to revise this legisla\u00adtion as well, as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the 8-hour labor law to make them easier of enforcement and more compatible with present conditions and exigencies. The same thing should be done with the Rice Tenancy Law so as to clarify existing doubts regarding the application of the 70-30 sharing in the harvest. We shall continue the furtherance of the protection being accorded the individual laboring man. For his health and security, as well as for the protection of his rights, a vigorous campaign for the enforcement of the laws enacted for his benefit, which are also for the preservation of his employer, is being waged and shall continue unabatedly.\r\nThe welfare of our workers who have seen fit to search for well-being abroad will likewise be our continuing concern.\r\nAs important in our agenda on behalf of labor, is that which deals with land distribution and settlement. This last year, 1,686 settlers, not counting their dependents, have been accommodated in land reservations in Cotabato, Bukidnon, Lanao, and Isabela. Our settlement projects today have a total population of 115,000. These do not include families from Luzon and the Visayas who of their own accord go to Mindanao under the law you have authorized. Resettlement work will be pushed through with more intelligence and vigor. The great purpose of this project must not be lost in its detail. It is to vouch\u00adsafe to each man a place truly his own. It is not to in\u00adcrease the holdings of those who already have, or to increase the number of absentee landlords. These groups do n0t need government assistance. They are capable of taking care of themselves. Settlers shall therefore be selected from areas where feudalistic tenancy still persists to the present day. In view of the limited areas available for settlement in proportion to the great number of landless people, it may be necessary to consider the grouping of such settlers to operate government farms under con\u00adtractual arrangements. In this way, we could accelerate the production of the staple commodities of which we are in daily demand.\r\nFor our floating labor populations in industrial communi\u00adties, I wish to inform you of the progress in our housing program. The housing program for the low-salaried in both public and private employments in the City of Manila is being accelerated. One thousand seven hundred seventy \u00adone housing units have been built at a cost of over P5 million since 1948. The construction of 655 more is being com\u00adpleted in a few months. Our target for this year is a total of 3,500.\r\nA salutary consequence of this program is the awakened interest that private investors have developed in under\u00adtaking similar low-cost housing projects in Iloilo, Baguio, and other centers of population. I have just organized the Home Financing Commission created by Act No. 580 you have recently enacted to supplement and coordinate our home construction policy.\r\nOur disaster relief activities have been effective these past two years. But although well coordinated, they need better support. We felt this great necessity during the last two devastating typhoons, the worst in many years in the Visayan provinces, and during the recent eruption of the Hibok-Hibok Volcano. We have leaned heavily upon our people for voluntary assistance to the victims and casualties of these disasters. I wish to stress the necessity of restoring the appropriation originally given to the Action Committee on Social Amelioration, now merged with the Social Welfare Administration, in order to provide for adequate relief for victims in such disasters and other calam\u00adities, especially the recent typhoon sufferers.\r\nThe victims of the 1951 public disasters will take years to rehabilitate themselves. The coconut industry in the Visayas has been practically totally damaged. In many places it cannot be restored to productivity except by replanting. This means for the next three to seven years sectors of our population dependent upon that industry for a livelihood will have to shift elsewhere. The damages to the sugar, corn, and rice industries are not as extensive but they have set back these industries and their reper\u00adcussions will be felt in the coming months.\r\nOther than the consequences of the great disasters that occurred during the year, the state of the public health may be considered normal. No epidemic visited the country. The birth rate increased; the total crude death rate de\u00adcreased. Infant mortality also decreased. At the incep\u00adtion of every natural disaster, public health forces were immediately deployed to take care of casualties and to prevent the development of epidemics.\r\nWe must continue to improve the public health to con\u00adserve manpower for the development of our agricultural, industrial, and other natural resources. We have made notable progress in lessening the scourge of malaria, tuber\u00adculosis, malnutrition, mental ailments, and other debilitating diseases.\r\nEnvironmental sanitation and health education have been promoted. More artesian wells and sanitary facilities have been provided. More hospitals have increased available hospital beds. More charity clinics, puericulture centers, public health nursing establishments, and public health la\u00adboratories have been activated.\r\nPreventive and sanitary measures against infectious and quarantinable diseases have avoided epidemics from indi\u00adgenous sources and from abroad through international traffic and trade. The production of more vaccines and sera has been notably increased. Our BCG laboratory is rated the best and the largest in this region. We are pro\u00adducing vaccines for Formosa and Indo-China, besides filling our own requirements.\r\nEducation is another fundamental of national progress from the standpoint of society and of production efficiency. No legislative body of the Philippines, since the days of the First Assembly, has ever been remiss in generosity for this function of public service. It is our established obsession that no child in the Philippines should be bereft of instruction. I am happy to say that in the past year as well as in the previous two years this Republic saw to it that the so-called school crisis has not recurred.\r\nLast October, upon being informed that thousands of children would not be accommodated, I authorized after consultation with the Council of State the release of P1,630,000 to cover the employment of additional teachers. We have now an elementary school population of four million. In the ratio of school enrollment to total population, we rank next to the United States, the highest of any country in the world.\r\nThrough administrative adjustments we helve strengthened the holding power of the schools and have brought about a much lower rate of withdrawal. The two-session program has been partially restored. Increases in enrollment have also been noted in the secondary schools, in normal and technical schools, and on the collegiate level.\r\nCommunity school programs bringing teachers and pupils closer to their community are being instituted. Work\u00ading with other agencies, the schools are assisting in im\u00adproving community life along health, social, cultural, and economic lines.\r\nCurricular offerings are being adjusted to inculcate work, consciousness and to provide work experience along the lines indicated by the dominant occupational activities and needs of the community. One objective is the revival of characteristics local cottage industries. You have facilitated this extra-curricular work by your approval of financial support of pre-service vocational, teacher preparation, espe\u00adcially in agriculture, trade, industries, and business.\r\nAs an incentive to further vocational training, we have converted the Mu\u00f1oz Agricultural School into a college, in line with our policy established in the conversion of the Philippine Normal School into a college and various pro\u00advincial trade and agricultural schools into national regional institutions.\r\nPrivate schools continue to supplement government efforts in education. But the rapid growth of the private school system poses the problem of effective supervision for the maintenance of scholarship standards at high level.\r\nThe rehabilitation of the major road and bridge projects undertaken jointly by our Government and the Govern\u00adment of the United States has been continued and pushed through with vigor during the year.\r\nNinety percent of the war-damaged water supply systems have been restored to operation. Construction of new waterworks projects, market buildings, bridges, municipal presidencias, and other public improvements financed from revolving loan funds or from loans extended by the Re\u00adhabilitation Finance Corporation, is continuing.\r\nThe investigation and survey of irrigation projects have been accelerated. Today eight new projects to water 78,500 hectares are awaiting construction, we completed the con\u00adstruction of 12 systems this past year, placing an additional 26,400 hectares under irrigation. Four projects furnishing water to another 15,100 hectares are under construction. When the Ambuklao outflow is harnessed, it will irrigate 48,000 hectares from Mt. Province to Central Luzon. The construction off flood control works in the Agno and the Pampanga river basins is proceeding apace.\r\nWe finished construction during the year of five adminis\u00adtration, 138 school, four hospital, nine public health, and seven radio station war-damaged buildings, financed partly from U.S. war damage funds, and 47 administration, 212 school, 110 market, 51 general office, 22 hospital, 46 public health, and 90 other miscellaneous buildings exclusively by our government. But the typhoons in the Visayas again wrought havoc, destroying even buildings completed last year, especially school houses.\r\nTwenty national and five municipal ports and 29 light\u00adhouses have been rehabilitated and placed in service. Dredging of the Port of Manila, including the esteros, and the Pasig River is now 40 percent completed. Dredging of the Ports of Iloilo and Pulupandan is nearing completion. Five seawall projects have been constructed and repaired. The Dewey Boulevard has been extended. and filling is ex\u00adpected to be completed by May of this year.\r\nTwelve additional post offices were opened. Regular air\u00admail service to Israel and certain places in Palestine was resumed on May 5, 1951. Effective October 1, 1951, the twice-a-week airmail service to the United States was in\u00adcreased to six-times-a-week service. On January 1, 1951, the indemnity system of registration in 65 post offices located in chartered cities and provincial capitals was resumed.\r\nThirteen radio, seven telegraph, and 14 telephone stations and offices were established. Various telegraph and ra\u00addio stations in strategic locations are open 24 hours to handle peace and order campaign messages. During the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok, personnel of the Mambajao radio station stuck to their posts night and day. It was only when working in the vicinity was no longer possible that the station was moved to Mahinog where they kept the same vigil.\r\nAs a corollary of our aggressive program of increased production, we should adopt a more systematic and ex\u00adpanded transportation policy. Nothing can be considered produced until placed where needed for utilization. Progressive society is dependent upon transportation. It is time that, to derive maximum use of our meager resources, we established planned and coordinated programming of public expenditures intended for the provision of transport\u00adation facilities. Our government is committed to the main\u00adtenance of highways, bridges, port works, harbors, air\u00adfields, air and sea navigational aids. We should begin to explore the problems, possibilities, and potentials of a rail\u00adway system in Mindanao, and provide for the extension of the existing system to Northern Luzon, especially in the Cagayan Valley.\r\nI am happy to report to you that in specific, routine materials, our government has established most satisfactory relations with other governments and peoples, which will enhance not only our relations with them, but our economic well-being by fruitful and mutually beneficial contacts.\r\nWe have been able to secure to our people a pledge of unqualified assistance in maintaining our country\u2019s security and its integrity, by the one great power which is in a position to offer and fulfill such guarantees\u2014the United States of America.\r\nOur relations with America remain what they have always been: relations of intimate and understanding alliance. Not just because America needs a base in the Far East, or because the Philippines needs the American market, but because fundamentally there is a bond of mutual ideal and aspiration between the Filipino and the American peoples that transcends the material factors of security and trade.\r\nThis ideal has motivated our relations with other free nations. Nor has it militated against our relations, with our neighbors and our brothers in race in this region of the world. Rather, it has enhanced them. For, as our neighbors have gained their well-deserved independence and sove\u00adreignty, it is to the example of basic Philippine-American relations that they turn when they consider their departure from the colonial status.\r\nThe routinary aspects of our foreign affairs are well known to you. I shall, therefore, limit myself today in recommending to your serious consideration two important treaty proposals which will be placed before you.\r\nOne is the Philippine-American Mutual Defense Treaty. I feel there is no need of special advocacy of this treaty.\r\nThe other is the Japanese peace treaty, signed by us in San Francisco in September of last year.\r\nI fully appreciate the reasons for the reluctance which many of you will entertain in considering this document. At this time, all I can say is that our signing of this docu\u00adment in San Francisco has not been done thoughtlessly, or on pressure, but on a sober appraisal of what is best for this Republic in the state in which the world finds itself today.\r\nGentlemen of the Congress: We can perhaps take par\u00addonable pride in the substantial achievement that we have made in economic, financial and social stability, and in political security. However, in spite of the fact that the climate will probably continue to be favorable for further progress in these fields, I am compelled to say that we cannot relax in our efforts. It is still necessary for us to continue exercising the greatest discretion and vigilance.\r\nThere are external factors affecting our economic, social, and political stability over which we have little or no control at all. Let us not add to the problems that they will pose by allowing internal factors, over which we have control, to get out of hand.\r\nVigilance against threats to our internal and external security must be continued. Inflation must not be permitted resurgence. Our ability to keep it in check de\u00adpends largely upon our determination to continue observing and strengthening the sound fiscal and monetary policies and practices we have promulgated these last three years.\r\nNo amount of outside assistance can place our economic development program on a continuing and self-generating basis. It is only our own resources that can serve as the prime mover of our development process.\r\nWithin our limits we must sustain our determined effort to push through without delay every project designed to achieve a more balanced economy for our country.\r\nECA aid is beginning to flow. When it does come in substantial amounts, we should be able to speed up our work.\r\nWe should take steps to bring about a review of the Trade Agreement with the United States, to suit changing exigencies consistent with a diversified and balanced economy.\r\nFinally, the increasing vigilance against, and prosecution of, every form of corruption this administration has been waging these past years should suffer no abatement. The record of dismissals, prosecutions, and convictions the past five years must warn every public servant that public service is the highest form of stewardship requiring utmost integrity and strictest discipline. I have wanted, while holding the Presidency, to inspire every man in the public service with pride in the organization to which he belongs, and every citizen with equal pride in his government. And may I say in addition that every public servant, whether in the national, provincial, city or municipal, or even the barrio, should remember that he is in the government to help the people and not to utilize his position to his personal benefit. (Applause)\r\nThe world in which we live is a troubled, uncertain world. At no period in history have the masses of the world been better informed; yet at no period has there been greater groping, more searching, for a way to peace and to well\u00adbeing.\r\nIn such a world it is with pride, yet with the humility which is our duty to Divine Providence that we look on our own nation, and find in it the hope that is born of faith and nurtured in achievement.\r\nWhen we consider that many other nations of the world are reeling under impact of the world crisis, our coun\u00adtry\u2019s position of over-all security is a matter of some gra\u00adtification. But security-economic, internal and external and the resultant political stability which we have achieved, are a continuing responsibility. No nation can long exist if content merely to maintain a state of security for the current generation, and oblivious of the challenge of its generations to come.\r\nWe cannot be complacent. We should bend every effort to make our country stronger, to insure as far as we are able the security of our children.\r\nNothing is permanent in human institutions except the struggle to maintain and improve them. I ask that you bear in mind this unending struggle along the road on which our people are marching towards their destiny. That destiny, under the guidance of Him who gave His people will and reason, may be shaped by us. But into the labor of shaping it must go not only the goodwill and the calm reason, but the unity of all the people, without which many may \u00a3all behind, many may be destroyed, and none may reach the shining goal. Thank you.\r\nI therefore appeal to you again for national unity\u2014unity that is not a temporary adjustment of differences, or a mere agreement to vote together on this or that issue.\r\nIt is something much deeper. It has its roots and its being in the spirit that moves a man to look to his neighbor as one whose well-being, whose future, is linked with his own. It is the deep-rooted sense that if my neighbor, my fellow-citizen, my brother Filipino comes to harm, I too am harmed; I too will sustain injury. My own children cannot grow and flourish to the nation\u2019s honor, if his chil\u00addren are denied the opportunity to grow and flourish.\r\nThis, gentlemen of the Congress, is what I understand by national unity. Not the expedient unity of the polls, but that unity which brings to us the recognition of common problems, common tasks, common honor, and the need for common struggle. It is unity to face and foil the dangers which continually arise to harass us as a people.\r\nWhatever our political creeds, we must close ranks and lead our people to a new horizon, leaving behind us the doldrums of inaction, mutual suspicion, intrigues, and re\u00adcrimination. Let us rise to the challenge of this critical hour and create for our country a new atmosphere, an atmosphere of faith, of courage, of cheerfulness, of determina\u00adtion, and thus inspire our people to greater efforts in our struggle for continued existence. Instead of passively crossing our arms in helplessness and frustration, let us ad citizens of a country with such a heritage of fortitude and courage, arise as one to fight together to give our people a life\u2019 of substance, of strength, of contentment. This is the call that we must heed. To do so is to show the patriotism, the new heroism that this epoch demands.\r\n1. Special appropriation measures for immediate relief in typhoon disasters, and provision for more adequate re\u00adlief in other calamities.\r\n2. Revision, for purpose of clarification, of the Rice Tenancy Law.\r\n3. Establishment of a Rural Credit System to provide credit facilities to small farmers and tenants.\r\n4. Amendment to the law restricting the sale or lease of public lands to the landless or those who do not own more than 100 hectares, and providing cancellation of sales or leases to those who do not actually cultivate the land.\r\n5. Extension of vocational training, including the crea\u00adtion of other colleges of the Munoz type, and institutes of research on scientific methods of production of our staple commodities.\r\n6. Further study of the minimum wage law to make it easier of enforcement and to make it more adaptable to local conditions, and corresponding revision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law to make it conform to present exigencies.\r\n7. More systematic construction of roads, bridges, and other means of transit, including railways, in regions of production and where industrial needs demand better facilities of communication.\r\n8. More coordinated and effective investigations in administrative cases.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1951-01-22 10:49:53+00:00", "author": "Elpidio Quirino", "text": "[Released on January 22, 1951]\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nI join you today in opening your greatest opportunity yet to make history for our people. This is a year excep\u00adtionally heavy with decision and destiny; and your actuations in this your second regular session may spell the difference between irreparable disaster and survival to our country.\r\nI appreciate the earnest response of the Congress to the urgent call of action on the tax legislation program sub\u00admitted in the last two special sessions which I had called for the purpose. I am gratified by the thoroughness with which you have discussed the individual tax measures. I am happy that you have passed the military appropria\u00adtion bill to provide means for immediate strengthening of our fighting units for internal security.\r\nThe solid action of both houses in approving a concurrent resolution expressing the policy of this Government to give preferential and serious consideration to the main recommen\u00addations of the U.S. Economic Survey Mission to accelerate social reform and economic development, and strengthen free and democratic institutions, is an earnest of our determinations to do our part to earn American assistance under the Economic Cooperation Administration.\r\nIt is understandable that all these measures cannot be approved in the twinkle of an eye; they involve our capac\u00adity not only to shoulder immediate additional tax burdens but also a long-range program of fiscal rehabilitation and financial stability. But the necessity to provide for our imperative needs in the present world crisis presses, as the untoward effects of their neglect mount daily in propor\u00adtion and importance. Therefore, it is my sincere hope that special efforts will be exerted to carry out our program with\u00adout much delay.\r\nI refer especially to those measures designed to bolster our security from within and ward off danger from without. Of course, it will be next to impossible to provide for a com\u00adplete program of national defense with our limited resources alone. We need a goodly measure of outside assistance from friends and allies, particularly the United States; and, to deserve that, we must show beyond cavil that we have the spirit and the will to help ourselves.\r\nOur preparations for defense are not for our own sur\u00advival alone. We are no less participating directly in the implementation of a world issue, doing our proportionate share in the world effort to preserve peace and freedom for all. Our earnest efforts, therefore, to provide for our own security under the present circumstances become a vital part of our contribution to world security.\r\nOn the occasion of your three special sessions called after your last regular session I reported to you, and in my radio chats every fifteenth of the month, to the people, on the state of the nation. And as close and constant ob\u00adservers of \u00b7world developments, you bear witness to such a succession of events as to keep you well apprised not only of the state of the nation but of the \u00b7world situation. It is, therefore, superfluous to repeat in this message, which I intended to be brief, all the problems that have been and are facing us, or to enumerate in detail the unfinished work requiring our common action. I shall, therefore, mention only the outstanding and most pressing ones.\r\nI shall begin with the health of our citizenry. The state of health of the nation is satisfactory, but there is much room for improvement. . Many of our people do not drink clean water and it is extremely costly to construct water systems during these days of financial stringency. There should be more artesian wells in cities and municipalities, especially in the barrios.\r\nThe country needs more hospitals and clinics.\r\nGreater impetus should be given to the campaign against malaria, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. We should produce more vaccines and sera and other biological products and antibiotics.\r\nThe merging of the Social Welfare Commission and the PACSA into the Social Welfare Administration has been conceived in order to coordinate and concentrate our atten\u00adtion and better promote the welfare of the less privileged class of our population. With the reorganization thus ef\u00adfected, I am sure we will further improve the social welfare services.\r\nMore social reforms are due to enable the landless to own their lands, earn their livelihood, and enjoy a higher stand\u00adard of living. It is never enough to promise social justice. Our most effective answer to Communism is a genuine strengthening of our national social program for the definite and positive improvement of the people\u2019s welfare.\r\nOur immediate need is to provide adequate wherewithal to carry out our social amelioration program. The reduc\u00adtion of our appropriation for this purpose last year has greatly handicapped our relief and assistance to the needy.\r\nI trust that you will act upon the pending minimum wage bill. We want no regions or industries in the Philippines to fatten on underpaid labor.\r\nThe Conventions and Recommendations under the Inter\u00adnational Labor Organization to which the Philippines is a party should be ratified. They deal with the means of pro\u00adtecting our workers and promoting industrial harmony. They embody the most notable experiences of practically all the countries of the world, and provide us with a highly dependable guide for constructive social and labor legislation. Both the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the Woman and Child Labor Law, and other laws, parts of which have be\u00adcome obsolete, must also be revised to make them more responsive to the present needs of our people.\r\nDespite limited finances, we have been able to accom\u00admodate all the children seeking admission in the public schools. But mere admission is not enough. We must pro\u00advide a type of education adequate to produce constructive, honest, efficient, disciplined, and loyal citizens.\r\nIn the reorganization of the Department of Education, I emphasized the necessity of giving more impetus to vocational training. It is my hope that by a proper revision of our educational laws, coupled with adequate funds and adjustment in the curriculum, our millions of students in our public schools alone could be made to produce many of the things that we need today and not wait for the full develop\u00adment of their potentiality.\r\nWe have revitalized the judiciary by appointing men of proven ability and integrity, and by imposing a more ex\u00adpeditious disposition of court cases. In the face of threats posed by unscrupulous elements, our courts have acted positively and courageously in cases prejudicial to the general welfare and security. But we need more judges of first instance to cope with the increasing work. We need also more severe measures to implement our deter\u00admination to have the laws safeguarding the life and health of our citizenry enforced.\r\nWith the help of the U.S. Government under the Rehabilitation Act and with our own appropriations, a total of 1,012.7 kilometers of new roads was added last year to our highway system. Four new bridges were constructed and 321 bridges reconstructed. Six new irri\u00adgation systems with a total of 23,000 hectares to be served were built. Under construction are seven major irrigation projects covering a total area of 20,200 hectares. We have maintained 14 irrigation systems already serving 83,600 hectares.\r\nIt is necessary, however, that we provide for more urgent projects such as irrigation, waterworks, artesian wells, roads, and bridges. The construction of a network of roads in Mindanao must be accelerated in order to give impetus to the agricultural and industrial development of this fertile region. Funds should be made available for the estab\u00adlishment there of a more extensive and efficient telecom\u00admunication system.\r\nIn spite of our efforts to rehabilitate our badly damaged agriculture, we still have plenty to do in order to attain our goal. The production of copra, lumber, and others has been brought to prewar level, but our output of sugar, abaca, tobacco, and gold among others has remained below that of 1941. We should accelerate and increase produc\u00adtion. We must make our country self-sufficient in food and other essentials. We should produce not only what we actually need but what we shall need in the impending greater emergency. We should set aside more funds to hasten the subdivision of public lands and to expedite the necessary surveys needed for the issuance of titles.\r\nThe application of trade controls to meet the existing emergency has resulted in the recessive trend of trade in the country. However, we have been able to improve the posi\u00adtion of our foreign trade. Our unfavorable trade balance during the 11 months of 1950 amounted to over P28.8 million only as against P547.1 million for the same period in 1949.\r\nPresent precarious conditions demand the continuance for the time being of economic control measures and their im\u00adprovement. At the same time appropriate measures should be taken to control exports and prevent the exportation of essential commodities and critical materials needed for con\u00adstruction and national defense.\r\nMeasures have been taken to stockpile essential commod\u00adities, to lessen the curtailment of imports of equipment and materials for agriculture and industry, and to allow the unlimited import of foodstuffs. The control of prices must be made more effective everywhere. To this end, certain amendments to the Price Control Law are necessary.\r\nOwing to the control of imports, 60 cigarette factories and seven nail factories, among others, have been established. To prevent overcrowding of new industries, a system of licensing of new industries should be adopted.\r\nI am submitting today the final executive acts to complete the reorganization of the Executive Department, under the authority granted by the Congress in Act No. 422. I take this occasion to express my appreciation for the con\u00adscientious work undertaken by the Reorganization Commis\u00adsion, headed by Minister Ramon Fernandez, which greatly helped me in this major work of government reorganization.\r\nWhile few radical changes have been made due to the present political development of the country and the social and economic repercussions that a drastic reorganization en\u00adtails, it must be stated that the prime objectives of efficiency, simplicity, and economy have weighed heavily in the de\u00adtermination of the changes effected.\r\nIn the Executive Department alone, we have been able to effect economies estimated at P5,000,000 in the present budget. A major portion of the savings, however, will be utilized to pay the gratuities of officers and employees whose positions have been abolished. But the yearly saving of P5,000,000 hereafter is awaited.\r\nIn the reorganization of government-owned and controlled corporations, it is estimated that a savings of P7,000,000 will also be effected. The discontinuation of enterprises which have been incurring substantial recurrent losses in the past years and the recasting and coordination of the activities for greater efficiency and economy of the corporations that re\u00admain, will likewise add to the estimated saving of P7,000,000 by the reorganization of the other entities.\r\nAll in all, therefore, an estimated yearly saving of P12,000,000 has been effected due to the reorganization. But this is not the limit. It is my hope that, with a more detailed study of the changes which have been started, the Congress may yet make judicious changes in several branches of the government in order to reduce the overhead expenses of administration.\r\nWith combined assets estimated at over P1.2 billion, the government-owned and controlled enterprises, have been reduced from 23 to 13, but will continue to exert decisive influence in various parts of the Philippine economy. It is gratifying to note the readiness with which private leaders of industry have responded, making themselves available in the cooperative work of coordinating public and private enterprises.\r\nBut the present government agencies assigned to im\u00adplement the economic rehabilitation and development prog\u00adram are not structurally patterned to meet emergency situa\u00adtions. They do not possess adequate power and authority in themselves, separately, to cope with the new situation. Thus, I have appointed an Economic Mobilization Committee composed of members of the Cabinet and of the Congress and economic leaders outside the government to study the advisability of centralized direction and control over the economic forces of the country that should be concentrated and coordinated to assure that changing conditions may be met promptly and effectively.\r\nPhilippine economy made great strides last year. Through the efforts of the government and our people, the nation\u2019s economy is again on the upgrade. Much still remains to be done. Our development program must be pushed through with vigor.\r\nLast year the Philippines achieved a favorable balance in international payments of $85.4 million as against a deficit of $161 million in 1949. However, dollar receipts in 1951 are expected to be much less due to the termination of U. S. war damage payments.\r\nI am gratified to observe the determination of the Congress to follow up our commitments for the implementation of our understanding with the United States leading to financial assistance under the ECA. But I must state that our tax program is not predicated merely on our desire to do our part in furtherance of said commitments. We have to provide for our most critical and urgent necessities. In fact, if we have to adequately meet our imperative needs, we must have an income more than the goal of P565 million envisaged in that understanding. But I know the capacity of our people. I would not be a party to bleeding them to inanition. Nevertheless, we must all make a sacrifice, not merely to meet ECA requirements but to insure our own good and safety. With the approval of our pending tax program, both can be substantially accomplished.\r\nI realize that the tax bills are not popular, for taxes are seldom popular, if at all. They are, however, of absolute necessity now. There is no longer any other source for needed public funds. The borrowing capacity of our Gov\u00adernment is limited. We cannot justifiably look always to the United States to meet our budgetary requirements. This Government cannot be delivered to the Treasury of the United States. We need additional revenues to carry out more effectively our peace and order drive, to educate our children, to protect our people against epidemics, to provide for our national defense, and even for the normal functions of government alone. And certainly, we need additional revenues to finance and accelerate the implemen\u00adtation of our economic development program in order to promote a rising level of production and employment. We must convince our people not to begrudge the just share of each for the ultimate benefit and protection of all. After all, the tax program before you places the burden on those who are able to pay and aims to correct inequalities under the present tax system.\r\nSome eight months ago, the majority of our people believed that the solution of our peace and order problem could be achieved primarily by the adoption of measures other than military. Even today there are some who delude themselves into believing that our peace and order problem is predominantly a social one. Social and economic measures will doubtless contribute immeasurably to the solution of this vital problem. For that reason, I have put into operation various non-military agencies to look after the welfare of the masses in various areas.\r\nPresent conditions, however, compel us to meet this problem with military force. We cannot risk losing by sheer default the priceless heritage of freedom we still enjoy.\r\nI am pleased to note that the people and the Congress have given unqualified support for the increase in strength of the Armed Forces by ten battalion combat teams.\r\nIn behalf of our fighting men, I urge approval of the bill now before you, granting gratuity and other benefits to officers and men of the Armed Forces who become casualties in the present anti-dissident campaign. Only by doing so can we hope to do justice to our gallant men who are engaged in the heroic task of restoring peace and order in this country in the shortest possible time.\r\nEqually urgent is our task of making available to the Armed Forces the necessary funds to make possible the retirement of officers and men who have served the country so faithfully and well and thus accelerate their replacement with younger and deserving elements.\r\nThe new year presages events of extremely serious con\u00adsequences, particularly to the countries in the Far East. Almost two years ago I presented to the American people, through the U. S. Senate, their highest foreign policy\u00admaking body, to the problem of security of the free coun\u00adtries of Asia. I said then, and I say it now, that \u201cI consider it my supreme responsibility in this perilous hour to call upon our friends everywhere, but especially our friends in America, not to tarry too long in the redefinition of fundamental attitudes towards Asia,\u201d in the face of growing Communist menace and aggression, for the issue involves \u201cthe fate of more than half of mankind in the next thousand years.\u201d I decried the lack of \u201ccalm, de\u00adliberate movement towards clarity, vigor, and resolution.\u201d I observed then that the reaction was suppressed or cautious concern. And I posed, \u201cOnly the blind will say that the menace does not concern America, because the history of the last two world wars shows all too clearly that this great democracy cannot remain unconcerned wherever and whenever the survival of free men in a free world is at stake.\u201d\r\nAmerica\u2019s immediate action last June in the\u00b7 defense of the freedom of South Korea justified my prediction. And we are now fighting side by side with her\u00b7 and the forces of the United Nations, in the plains and mountain fast\u00adnesses and ravines in Korea, in our determined adherence to the principles of peace, liberty, and justice against the forces of aggression.\r\nOwing to the mounting tension and uncertainty, we have therefore urged for a thorough and expeditious implemen\u00adtation of our military assistance pact with the United States. And we have received assurances from the Amer\u00adican Government that the United States will help us defend our national integrity and independence.\r\nBut we cannot depend entirely on foreign assistance to maintain our integrity. National honor and dignity re\u00adquire that we do not accept the role of a mere ward in the defense of our own liberty and freedom. Thus, we are making the utmost sacrifice to meet our internal and external obligations to enable us to contribute our just share to world security. For we can only hope that world statesmanship will eventually find a peaceful and honorable solution to the pressing problems that threaten the freedom and security of mankind.\r\nGentlemen of the Congress, I have come not merely to urge action, but to offer cooperation. We must pull to\u00adgether and assume solidarity of responsibility in the\r\nion of a program for our country\u2019s preservation. I have come to ask that we all concentrate our united efforts to insure our stability as a nation and preserve our liberty as a people. This is our sworn solemn duty, and we can .do no better than share cheerfully and decisively in the discharge of that great responsibility.\r\nThese are unusual times indeed. We are called upon to do our utmost in a situation in which we have never been placed before. We have to summon all our courage and intelligence and coordinate and contribute all the strength we can muster, in material and moral resources. We can\u00adnot afford to fail in meeting the present problem of sur\u00advival.\r\nArms without valor, however powerful, are useless weapons. Valor can be aroused only by a righteous cause. This we have, and we are pledged to fight for it and if need be to die for it. We are doing that right now even beyond our borders. We are increasing our forces for this cause-the cause of innocent free men, women, and children in our midst and everywhere, ravished and destroyed by the agents of a foreign foe bent on world domination.\r\nBut we know that armed forces are not enough. We need even more critically, on the part of all of us, a moral rearmament. Our greatest enemy can be ourselves when we stubbornly resist to purge what is selfish in us. The world is not merely on the verge of fire; it is on fire. And yet people can be immobilized by fiddling and tem\u00adpo razing while the nation\u2019s very life and future are at stake. Let us, as leaders of this nation, give the appro\u00adpriate example in moral rearmament. Let us, to the limit of our spiritual resources, will to fight the formidable enemy, whose lust for world power has impressed many of our people, to the extent of falling for his familiar tricks of fostering dissension and subversive ambition.\r\nAt this most critical moment, our attitude has become a matter of individual and collective conscience. I call upon you to stand as one man, morally and spiritually rearmed to rise and protect our country and people from the blight of inaction and fratricidal strife in a period of the greatest peril.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1950-01-23 10:46:28+00:00", "author": "Elpidio Quirino", "text": "[Released on January 23, 1950]\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Congress:\r\nCircumstances beyond my control make me forego the pleasure of appearing in person to deliver this message following a beautiful tradition established many years ago and adhered to most punctiliously by my predecessors in office. Although during your short period of special session coincident with my inauguration I had an opportunity to thank you informally for your prompt response on the measures that I recommended, I reiterate my deep appreciation for your fine spirit of cooperation from the start of this administration. I wish to assure you of the same cooperation in your legislative labors.\r\nIt give me great satisfaction to be able to report to you that, in spite of the unfavorable conditions under which we labored during the past year due to the intense and bitter political controversies which raged throughout the nation, we have achieved notable progress in our constructive endeavors.\r\nThere is relative peace and order in the entire country today. The sporadic activities of outlaws in isolated and widely dispersed localities are under control. There is no organized movement of any consequence that can be considered a threat to the stability of our Government. The recent attempt to challenge the authority of this Government by a few disgruntled elements has definitely ended with the surrender and offer of cooperation of these elements, and the amnesty granted by the Government. We can now say that, generally, our farms and our countryside are only awaiting the hand that would till the soil to contribute in proper measure to our productive efforts.\r\nOur social amelioration program has shed its beneficent blessings on the people inhabiting even the remotest confines of the archipelago; it has given a relief to small independent farmers within and beyond the once called troubled areas. It has so spread the gospel of peace and so inspired the people with faith in their Government, that it is well nigh impossible for the subversive elements to indoctrinate them now with their pernicious theories and ideas.\r\nWe have continued to give accommodation to every child of school age in our public schools. At the opening of the present school year, some 4,500,000 pupils were enrolled, almost one quarter of out entire population. Besides, we have extended adult education to over 160,000 people and have maintained all over the country a goodly number of vocational schools, including trade schools, agricultural and rural schools, and farm settlement schools. The farm and animal products alone coming from these schools have reached in 1948 the value of over P36,000,000, in itself a substantial contribution to our national wealth.\r\nOur health services have continued to expand with increasing efficiency. The general health condition all over the country has been excellent, and the death rate has materially diminished, while the birth rate has substantially increased. In my travels all over the country, I have seen the people and the children better dressed and looking more healthy. The rehabilitation of small homes has made rapid strides, and the Government has not slackened in its efforts to remove the slums still in evidence in the thickly populated centers. The price index of essential commodities reached a new low during the month of October 1949, raising the goods exchange value of the peso to 45:58 centavos, the highest since liberation.\r\nWhile we have not as yet discovered a fully satisfactory formula for settling or preventing all industrial disputes, every effort is being exerted to minimize stoppage or dislocation of industries because of unnecessary strikes. To foster mutual understanding and minimize the causes of industrial conflicts, we are encouraging and assisting labor and management to enter into free and voluntary collective bargaining contracts. We settled during the past year 87 out 0f 187 labor cases submitted for conciliation, and 77 out of 83 labor conflicts involving strikes. With the creation of the Bureau of Industrial Safety, we hope to promote further the safety and welfare of the laboring class. Various pieces of legislation are under study, all of them designed to improved industrial relations and ultimately achieve industrial peace. I cannot overestimate the necessity of evolving some satisfactory solution to this problem, for only through it may we have our efforts in production continue to progress unhampered, attract capital to further investments, and increase opportunities for employment.\r\nWe have continued to give impetus to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of public buildings, especially the schools, and have materially increased out means of transportation and communication throughout the country. Besides, we have, during the last year, added 1,370 kilometers of new roads to our highway system, 34 concrete and steel permanent bridges, and have constructed, reconstructed, or repaired of total of 1,212 school buildings. We have also put in serviceable condition no less than twenty outlying ports besides the port of Manila; and, in order to aid out productive efforts, we have maintained and operated 14 irrigation systems, constructed and placed in operation three additional ones, and we have now in process of construction five major irrigation projects, all of them sufficient to furnish water to some 110,000 hectares of agricultural land.\r\nAs to our public finances, it is gratifying to note that although our tax collection system is still far from perfect, our internal revenue collections alone reached the sum of P320,076,759.88 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1949, an all time high for the country, as compared to P263,023,100.88 for the preceding year, In 1947, our national tax collection totaled only P191,000,000 and, in 1946, P67,000,000. Withal, we must not relax in our efforts. A drastic reorganization of out tax-collecting agencies is now under way.\r\nWe have expanded in our foreign relations, especially with the peoples of neighboring countries. We set up during the last year a legation in Bangkok, a consulate-general in Calcutta, and consulates in Karachi and Batavia. For Latin America, we established a legation in Buenos Aires, and accredited Ambassador Joaquin M. Elizalde as Minister to Cuba in addition to his duties as ambassador to the United States.\r\nWe concluded treaties of friendship with the Kingdom of Thailand and with the Republic of Turkey; cultural agreements with the Spanish State; and air service agreements with the Government of Pakistan and with the Kingdom of Greece.\r\nOur contribution to world peace reached its peak when, with the election of Ambassador Carlos P. Romulo as President of the United Nations Assembly, the Philippines had the opportunity to preside over the deliberations of that world organization.\r\nBut in the rapid developments taking place in the Far East today, we should not be unmindful of our own national security\u2014territorial, political and economic. At long last the eyes of the world are turned to this new area of portentous possibilities. We must find our just and constructive place inspired by and fortified with all prudence, foresight and firmness in the face of the changing scenes unfolding before our eyes. As the first Republic to be established in the Far East, our responsibility is great. Our mission is to broaden and expand our freedom and enrich our democratic institutions and secure for our people and our neighbors higher standards of creative living.\r\nInternally, the most important problem facing us is the stabilization of our national economy.\r\nIn my annual message to the last Congress, I laid special emphasis on the urgent need for total economic mobilization. In line with this program, we have used all available means at our command in order to accelerate our development plans, rehabilitate our war-torn industries, and increase to the highest degree the production of export crops.\r\nWe have established priorities in the various projects that must be undertaken. The Central Bank which began to function at the beginning of 1949, implemented these plans with funds which it advanced to the national government under the provisions of section 137 of its charter.\r\nOut of the total P200,000,000 of direct advances which the Central Bank is authorized to make, about P117,332,003 has been allocated by the National Economic Council, P52,126,450 of which has been released by the Central Bank for the past year mostly for the following projects: P7,925,000 for the rice and corn project of the National Development Company; P1,843,170 for the abaca rehabilitation project; P1,000,000 for power development projects; P11,000,000 for irrigation projects; and P20,000,000 for the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation.\r\nIn aid of the rehabilitation and reconstruction program, the Government has also disbursed from the general funds huge amounts which, in effect, constitute capital expenditures of the Government out of its ordinary revenues. For the reconstruction of 7,395 school buildings alone, the national government spent P53,306,172.74 from 1946 to 1949. For other permanent public works projects, the Government likewise disbursed, until May 31, 1949, a total of P123,451,687.16, over and above those made by the United States Government through the War Damage Commission and the United States Public Roads Administration. Other capital expenditures for which funds had been made available by the Government were as follows: P31,495,400 from 1946 to 1949 to various government corporations for rehabilitating and expanding their activities; P54,423,079 to the RFC as contribution to its capital; P9,999,179 for the purchase of preferred shares of banks to assist in their rehabilitation; and P3,600,000 to domestic insurance companies for the same purpose.\r\nIn addition to direct government financing as above indicated, our program of rehabilitation and development has been aided and continues to be aided through loans granted by the Philippine National Bank and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. Industrial loans granted by the Philippine National Bank from 1946 to June of 1949 amounted roughly to P108,800,000.\r\nThe Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, from its opening on January 2, 1947 to June 30, 1949, granted a total of 12,195 loans aggregating P228,626,374.\r\nThe impetus given by both direct government financing and financing by government lending agencies and private financing institutions in the Philippines to our program of economic mobilization has borne fruit. During the last three years, we have achieved definite progress in the rehabilitation of our major food and export industries.\r\nThe record shows:\r\nProduction of palay, which was only 36,893,940 cavans in 1945-1946, was around 56,000,000 cavans in 1948-1949, or slightly higher than the production in 1940. And 1949 is the second year in which we had no rice crisis.\r\nCorn production is slightly higher than the pre-war production.\r\nThe production of fruits and nuts, beans and vegetables has improved over the pre-war record.\r\nThe fishing industry has not only recuperated rapidly since liberation, but has surpassed its pre-war output. In 1948, we produced 195,078 tons of fish, as against 170,000 in 1940, and the industry is now almost exclusively in Filipino hands.\r\nProduction of copra is in excess of pre-war. Oil production is below pre-war, but desiccated coconut output in 1948 exceeded the 1940 level.\r\nThe recovery of the sugar industry is one of the most encouraging signs in our post-war economic landscape. In 1945-1946, only four out of the 41 sugar mills in operation before the war were in operation. These four mills produced only 12,913.55 short tons. In 1947, production rose to 84,548.08 short tons and, in 1948, it went up to 398,113.10 short tons. During the milling season of 1948-1949, the industry produced a total of 719,324 short tons, and, for 1949-1950, estimates are that 800,000 short tons will be produced. There are now in operation 28 centrifugal sugar mills and two refineries.\r\nLumber is another industry which has recovered from the effects of war in a very striking manner. Of the 163 sawmills in operation before the war, 138 were destroyed, damaged or looted. Production of timber dropped from over one billion board feet in 1940 to 91,058,500 board feet in 1945-1946. It jumped in 1946-1947 to 438,784,500 board feet. Timber production for the year ending June 30, 1949 totaled again over a billion board feet. The production of sawn lumber has followed the phenomenal recovery in timber production.\r\nWith extraordinary effort and expense, we have no doubt attained a goodly part of our goals in the field of economic rehabilitation and development since independence in 1946; but much remains to be done to maintain our economy in a balanced state.\r\nWe have these past years since liberation seemingly enjoyed a life of plenty and even a luxury, not so much as a result of our productive energies as because of the temporary flow of money into our economy. Presently there is the large gap that has developed between the value of the products that we sell abroad and the cost of the products that we buy and bring into our country. We must realize that this state of affairs cannot continue without causing such disequilibrium in our economy as would eventually engulf us in the tremendous difficulties which other countries have experienced. It is because of this realization that we have taken immediate corrective measures to prevent a situation that would undermine the international stability and the internal value of our currency. This, we must maintain at all costs.\r\nBut we must not be unduly alarmed. We have taken such measures and we are taking other measures which, if carried out strictly and expeditiously, with the cooperation of one and all, should greatly improve our present economic situation. This country, with its vast resources, is as sound as any that there is on the face of the earth. I am confident that our people, trained as they have been, to undergo the extreme sacrifices that they have seen during the last war, will respond to the little inconveniences that the measures we are now taking might cause. These measures are none other than what any prudent man would take to correct a trend toward disaster if allowed unchecked.\r\nBut we are faced not only with the task of reducing import outlays and selecting which of our foreign purchases should be curtailed and which unrestricted in the interest of maintaining present standards of living. Ours is also the greater task of increasing our export receipts. This can be attained by carrying to full execution our rehabilitation and development as rapidly as possible. Projects that are promising of immediate results should be given preference over those that must of necessity, on account of their nature, take a long time to produce tangible returns.\r\nThus, our most serious concern for the next four years should be: immediate increased production through rapid rehabilitation and development; decreased public and external expenditures; Government reorganization to achieve efficiency, economy and effective rendition of public services responsive to the needs and welfare of our people; vigorous and honest enforcement of the tax laws; preservation of our national integrity and continued friendly relations with our neighbors and the entire world.\r\nLet us exert every effort and employ every ounce of our energy to implement these high objectives. Let us pool the enthusiasm, the labors, and the patriotism of a united people and honestly pull together for the promotion of the common good to make secure, for all time, our national structure.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1953-01-26 11:00:13+00:00", "author": "Elpidio Quirino", "text": "[Session Hall, Legislative Building, Manila, at 5:00 p.m., Monday on January 26, 1953]\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\nI wish to express my gratitude for your generosity and for the concurrent resolution passed by both Houses, inviting me to address this last session of the Second Congress this afternoon. It is not probable that the Executive and the Members of Congress would no longer be on speaking terms simply because certain divergent views have divided us in the recent past.\r\nThis Congress came into being at the start of the present administration. We have since faced in common the sharp challenge of extremely difficult problems, putting to severe test not only the vision and quality of contemporary statesmanship but the genius, resourcefulness, and patriotism of our people.\r\nIt is gratifying to report in honest retrospect that our Government has buckled down manfully to speed the restoration and improvement of our internal and external security, our finances, our essential public services, and our badly damaged economy.\r\nOwing to the marked improvement in the state of law and order our people have been able to concentrate their attention on the development of their farms, industrial activities, and other productive ventures.\r\nOur external security has been greatly enhanced by a mutual defense treaty with the United States and by the accelerated implementation of our military assistance pact with her, as well as by the clarification and strengthening of our common defense efforts of long standing.\r\nOur finances have been bolstered. Our National Government revenue jumped from P316,302,246.09 in 1949 to P611,460,943.82 in 1952, with the purchasing power of our peso maintained and its value recognized as one of the most stable in the world.\r\nOur national economy has been so improved that the national income has increased from P4 billion in 1946 to over P7 billion in 1952.\r\nWe have raised the salary standard, stabilized the status, and liberalized the privileges of the rank and file of the personnel of the National Government, especially the teachers, the nurses, the enlisted men in the Army, and the low-salaried employees, providing adequate pension and retirement systems for them.\r\nOur essential public services have been progressively improved and expanded, spreading throughout the country the benefits of health, education, and social welfare for our people to enjoy. Our death rate has been reduced; our birth rate, increased. The hardy perennial problems of inadequate school space and inadequate rice supply have become things of the past. And what is more, prices have gone down, living standards have been raised, and the lot of the common man, especially the laborer, has been greatly improved.\r\nOur foreign relations have grown and so developed that one of the sources of our strength is in the sympathy and high regard of our friends across the seas.\r\nAll these have placed us in a firmer and sounder position, increased our international credit, and enhanced our name and prestige abroad.\r\nI shall endeavor to make a more detailed but cursory review of how we have attained these accomplishments.\r\nThe task of advancing our internal security has been closely tied up with the problem of solving the threat of dissident terrorism and violence and of pacifying age-long social discontent. Therefore, we have sought the armed dissident elements in the open field, broken up their potential for organized disorder, and given them opportunity to return to peace and production. It has been a painful, costly, and tedious process, taxing our conscience in the sacrifice, in many cases, of life and property, in order to secure tranquility in our land and preserve our liberties and democratic institutions. Obviously we could not achieve these objectives merely at the point of the gun. We adopted a bold and ambitious program of social amelioration, mobilizing all our resources in an effort to provide a life of substance and contentment to the less fortunate, and cushioning the harsh effects of force with the reward of a home and a farm not only to the dissidents who were vanquished or who voluntarily surrendered and who promised to return to the ways of peace, but also to the so-called landless and homeless among our population. And our watchword has since been \u201cland for the landless, home for the homeless.\u201d\r\nAs a result, the Huks, who form the armed forces of the local Communists, are now driven to the mountain fastnesses and isolated hideouts hardly able to gather the remnants of their politburo which has been broken since more than a year ago. Discouraged and disillusioned, their followers are now daily surrendering, many of them starting a new life in settlements prepared for them, in the EDCOR under the Army, and in the mass settlement projects under the LASEDECO.\r\nWe have invigorated the LASEDECO. Until December last, it had already distributed to landless settlers 11,728 farm lots of from 8 to 12 hectares each, covering a total area of 120,000 hectares, besides allocating 11,308 home lots. These settlers are now farming their own land in Cotabato, Bukidnon, Isabela, and Palawan. They have hospitals, dispensaries, and tractor pools. They produce annually approximately 2.5 million cavans of palay, in addition to secondary crops like corn, mongo, and peanuts. There are now in operation, on the other hand, the EDCOR farming communities provided with modern facilities in Kapatagan, Lanao, and Buldong, Cotabato, for deserving dissidents and their families, many of whom now own their farm and home.\r\nThese settlers come from areas where tenancy has long existed. To bring the benefits of land distribution and settlement closer to troubled areas and to meet the reluctance of tenants to move far away from their old homes, I have reserved for the purpose 25,475 hectares in Rizal, 3,763.60 hectares in Nueva Ecija and Tarlac, 20,000 hectares in Isabela, in addition to over 30,000 hectares at Malig, already distributed and settled.\r\nDuring the last year, 11 subdivision projects have been completed by private contractors. Five survey parties of the Bureau of Lands have undertaken subdivision surveys of public lands. Two hundred forty-nine thousand hectares have been surveyed and distributed to 16,000 settler families. To protect small farmers from land grabbers or speculators, I have issued an executive order reserving for occupation in lots not in excess of 10 hectares each all public lands within six kilometers from all highways, being or to be constructed in Mindanao and other provinces under the PHILCUSA-MSA highway development program.\r\nIn Mindanao alone this program covers a network of highways connecting most of the important provinces of the region and traversing rich agricultural lands. The total combined length of these highways is approximately 560 kilometers. This will make available for occupation over 650,000 hectares of land under the provisions of said executive order.\r\nThese public land distribution and settlement programs supplement the landed estate purchase program. The Government has purchased since 1947 for resale to tenants 25 landed estates with a total area of 44,000 hectares costing over P18 million. Of this amount P14 million still remains unpaid. We had to borrow the purchase money from government banks. Continued acquisition of other landed estates had to be temporarily suspended because further borrowing from government banks would seriously endanger their financial position.\r\nWe have accelerated the construction of homes for the low-salaried employees and the laborers. In Quezon City the Peoples\u2019 Homesite and Housing Corporation is now operating 2,116 low-cost units. We have even provided a big-sized Labor Hospital for this sector.\r\nWe have also attracted private entities in the construction of low-cost houses for the lower middle class. Already the Philippine-American Insurance Company has constructed 50 of this type of houses in the City of Iloilo, another 50 in the City of Baguio, and is now commencing the construction of 600 new units in Quezon City. A plan is afoot to construct similar houses in Tacloban and Legaspi and other centers of population.\r\nOur program of slum clearance is being implemented with the construction of low-cost houses for squatter and low-income families, one in Pandacan, Manila, and another in Bago-Bantay, Quezon City. The former will house 480 families and the latter will have facilities for 800 families.\r\nWith the activation of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement in conjunction with the activities of the Social Welfare Administration and the barangay and\r\norganizations in the barrios, a new impetus is now reawakening social improvement in the rural areas throughout the country.\r\nUnderlying almost every major governmental activity is the desire to improve the worker\u2019s lot, better his working condition, improve his earning capacity, create for him widening opportunities for continued employment, and raise his living standard.\r\nAt no other comparable period has the workingman achieved greater gains for himself and his co-workers than during the past two or three years. These include: (1) raising his wage standard; (2) promotion of his safety against industrial injury and disease; (3) protection of employees sustaining injury or meeting death in line of duty; (4) improvement of working conditions of women and children; (5) expansion of national employment programs leading towards greater and more stabilized employment; (6) protection of prospective workers from illicit activities of employment agencies; (7) protection of workers against irresponsible union leadership; and (8) raising labor standards in general.\r\nA vigorous and determined campaign to enforce the Minimum Wage Law in both urban and rural areas has been pursued to insure for the workers and full benefits of the law.\r\nPublic health has remained at high level despite fires, typhoons, and repeated eruptions like those of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in Camiguin Island, Mindanao. Our health authorities and facilities have proven equal to the heavy exigencies imposed by such calamities.\r\nBetter sanitation has been achieved in diverse and effective ways. Stricter supervision over public eating places, markets, and slaughter houses has been enforced. Schools, industrial plants, and commercial houses have been subjected to systematic medical inspection. Immunization of the population against epidemic diseases has advanced where it is now willingly sought by everyone, young and old, rich and poor, healthy and infirm alike. We have spread the benefits of artesian well and sanitary facilities to more sectors, and have established an increasing number of hospitals, puericulture centers, charity clinics, and dispensaries\r\nThe recurring school crisis in past administrations has been met since three years ago. Last year we took the last step in this direction. With the diversion of P2,647,000 from the contingent funds of the Bureau of Public Schools, after consultation with the Council of State, we opened 3,000 new semestral classes in November last, benefiting 150,000 more children. In June this year, 225,000 more children of school age will be accommodating.\r\nWe have maintained our world position as the country with the second highest ratio of school enrollment to total population. We are surpassed in this respect only by the United States.\r\nWe now have a goodly number of agricultural and vocational schools. Enrollment in these schools has multiplied and soon an increasing number of youths will be leaving their doors properly equipped with vocational skills so essential in our economic development program.\r\nThe important role of private schools in the education of our youth deserves mention here. There are now throughout the archipelago 1,770 private educational institutions from the lower grades to university level, with over three-quarters of a million students. Were the government to shoulder their operation and maintenance, P60 million would still fall short of the money so required, excluding the cost of their buildings and equipment.\r\nWe have exerted every effort this past year to maintain and add to our system of highways and bridges and of other means of communications. Nearly 29,000 kilometers of roads and over 9,000 bridges are now being maintained and kept open to motor vehicle traffic. Two weeks ago, I opened the new Pinacanauan and Naguilian bridges in Cagayan and Isabela. These bridges together with the Malalam Bridge near Iligan, Isabela, will provide the Cagayan Valley with a continuous road. The Cotabato and Pagalu\u00f1gan bridges in Cotabato, which I likewise opened three months ago, will provide through transportation across the Cotabato Valley linking this region with Davao province. Eight, other bridges and 19 port works projects have been completed. Several large edifices, among them the P450,000 Sorsogon High School building and the P400,000 Cebu Capitol annex, are about to be completed. Being started are the P700,000 Quezon Memorial Mausoleum as part of the Quezon Foundation, and the Roxas Memorial Theater whose plans are being readied.\r\nNearly 500 wire-telegraph offices, 180 radio-telegraph stations, and over 1,160 postal offices now keep our population centers in close contact.\r\nRelated to our agricultural development program is our increasing endeavor to construct new irrigation systems. The Burgos Irrigation Project in Zambales, completed last August, waters approximately 6,000 hectares. Five other irrigation projects in the provinces of Quezon, Davao, Leyte, Ilocos Norte, and Nueva Ecija should be completed and harnessed this year. The construction of the P7,500,000 Jalaur irrigation project in Iloilo to serve no less than 15,000 hectares is starting next month. We now have 27 national irrigation systems servicing over 117,000 hectares of rice lands in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Bataan, Bulacan, Laguna, Quezon, Camarines Sur, Albay, Leyte, Iloilo, Antique, and Zambales.\r\nSixteen river control projects were completed last year and 35 more are now in varying stages of construction.\r\nThe level of agricultural production for domestic consumption and for export continues to rise. This year we will be producing enough rice for our own needs. In other food items, such as fish and poultry, production is expanding. Sugar output for the 1952-1953 crop years will not only fill the Philippine quota in the United States for the first time since liberation and our own domestic requirements, but also leave a surplus for other markets.\r\nThe total combined production during 1949 of certain selected commodities, like palay, corn, sugar, copra, root crops, etc., amounted to 5,576,000 metric tons. In 1952 this had increased to 7,503,000 metric tons or an increase of 35 per cent in three years. The total area of land devoted to the production of all crops reached 5,326,000 hectares in 1952, which exceeds by 380,000 hectares the 1949 area. At the average of two workers to put one hectare of land into production, we cab see that there were approximately three-quarters of a million more farm laborers who found occupation during 1952, compared t those working in 1949.\r\nMost significant has been the rise of new industries and a corresponding increase in industrial production. In two years and a half, we have established such important new industries as jute, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals, glass, nail, incandescent bulbs, toilet soap, rubber tires, plywood, bond and wrapping paper, asbestos, plastics, musical instruments, kettles, tableware, pencils, chalk, etc. Up to November 15 last, 165 new tax-exempt factories had begun manufacturing articles formerly imported.\r\nThis recent industrial development has been made possible by new capital investments, both local and foreign. In the manufacturing industries alone, the amount of private capital invested since 1948 at the time of incorporation has reached P117,942,813.88.\r\nOn the whole, investments in corporate and partnership ventures in 1952 were on the same level with those of the preceding year. Filipino capitalists and businessmen were greatly encouraged to adopt modern corporate methods increasingly. We have taken appropriate measures to safeguard public interest and to protect investors by the adoption of methods designed to curb, through rigid examination, the issuance of \u201cwatered\u201d stocks by registrant corporations.\r\nFrom February 1 to April 30 this year, we shall have the first Philippines International Fair. Besides the display of Philippine products together with those of the participating nations to promote world trade, the Fair will also show the agricultural, commercial, and cultural progress of the country as well as the recent advance that we have made in our industrial development.\r\nGreater efforts have been exerted on the whole towards increased Filipino participation in domestic trade. The capital structure of the corporations and partnerships registered during the first eleven months of the year shows that our nationals lead in both fields, especially with regard to investment of small merchants.\r\nLess than two years hence, the tariff levies on our exports to the United States will be in operation. By that time we shall be manufacturing articles and goods needing export markets and facing stiff competition there. We must therefore, attend to the problem of foreign trade promotion. We must locate markets for our products. This means that our home production should be placed on a competitive basis abroad not only in price but in quality. But more than anything else, our home market should be developed in order to promote our foreign trade.\r\nPhilippine foreign trade during the first eleven months of 1952 has aggregated P1,411.8 million, of which P773.4 million represents imports and P638.4 million represents exports. On the basis of these figures, the total trade for the whole year is expected to reach well over P1.5 billion, which will be less than the 1951 total of P1,790,516,663.\r\nThere is need for readjusting our foreign trade. We must redirect our productive potential towards agricultural development for self-sufficiency in the prime needs of our people, and towards industrial development base on the utilization of local raw materials. But unless our own countrymen ready and willing to invest in processing, are given adequate protection, they cannot survive in competition with foreign manufacturers. To rise above\r\nsubsistence level, and to achieve a standard of living to which we are entitled, we cannot afford to remain permanent suppliers of raw materials for industrial powers and permanent importers to processed consumer goods. It is time to readjust our trade and tariff policies to suit present conditions and to make them more effective instruments of our economic development.\r\nI propose the creation of a Tariff Commission to study the present tariff rates carefully and in detail. This we should do while we present our side to the United States in our desire to readjust our trade relations with her. The Problem is not easy. It will take some time before we can expect concrete recommendations for the required changes. Immediate action is essential not only to hasten our industrial development, but to provide for the necessary machinery or authority to act on the urgent changes or modifications in the tariff schedules to protect our interest in the meantime.\r\nMuch of the implementation of our economic development plans is entrusted to the corporations owned or controlled by the Government. Taken together, the operations of these corporations, except those of the Central Bank, the Philippine National Bank, and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, netted during the fiscal year 1952 a profit of P4,000,000 from a total income of P208,000,000. The three financial institutions made total profits of P24,933,202.43.\r\nThe Manila Gas Corporation whose majority stock has been acquired by the Government has been rehabilitated and has been operating since last month.\r\nThis year other important basic industries will begin operations. The two principal projects of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation will be completed\u2014the Mariveles shipyards in March, and the Iligan steel mills in September.\r\nThe Cebu Portland Cement Company with its present annual output of six million bags, together with the output of two privately-owned plants, does not fully meet local demand. A new plant of three million-bag capacity is therefore, under construction in Bacnotan, La Union.\r\nThe National Power Corporation\u2019s Maria Cristina hydroelectric and fertilizer plant projects will begin operations this May. The Ambuklao project is 15 per cent completed and the transmission lines to Manila are under installation. This project is estimated to cost P101,000,000, of which P61,000,000 has been furnished by our Government and $20,000,000 by loan from the United States Export and Import Bank. When completed it will supply power to the areas around the Mountain Province, to Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan, and Manila. Its reservoir will also supply irrigation water to approximately reservoir will also supply irrigation water to approximately 40,000 hectares of rice land in Northern and Central Luzon.\r\nThe three financial institutions of the Government, the Central Bank, the Philippine National Bank, and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation have continued the admirable partnership they have virtually established in meeting the credit requirements of Philippine agriculture and industry. Today, there is hardly any commercial, agricultural, or industrial activity of national economic importance which has not been assisted by one or all of these corporations,\u2015the Central Bank indirectly, of course, through the support it has given to the loan activities of the two other institutions.\r\nNew arrangements have been made to provide facilities for the financing of industrial development and to meet particularly the credit needs of small merchants and farmers. First, a special trust fund of P10,000,000 has been set up for the special account of the counterpart fund to guarantee a large share of the risk to be assumed by banking institutions granting industrial loans. Second, a plan has also been adopted whereby loans may be granted to Philippine financial institutions by the Central Bank on behalf of the Export and Import Bank from a fund of $5,000,000 that the latter institution has made available as loan for financing small productive enterprises in the Philippines. Third, rural banks are fast being established in various localities under the supervision of the Central Bank and with governmental capital assistance up to 50 per cent of their own paid-up capital out of an allocation of P2,000,000 from the counterpart fund. Lastly, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration has been established to deal exclusively and directly with one of the most serious difficulties from which the small farmer has from time immemorial suffered; namely, the procurement and marketing credit. For this purpose it has received a contribution of P2,000,000 from the counterpart fund.\r\nThese last two projects of loan assistance to the small farmers in line with the order programs of mutual economic assistance have been facilitated under MSA-PHILCUSA auspices. But they are but a few of the several projects to which the MSA and PHILCUSA have addressed themselves.\r\nIt is meet to note here the history of the Philippine-American Mutual Assistance Program. Upon my representations to President Truman in January, 1950, the Bell Mission was sent to the Philippines in July of the same year. Shortly after the Bell Mission Report in October of that year, Mr. William Foster came to the Philippines as the personal representative of President Truman to conclude with our Government a preliminary agreement known as the Quirino-Foster Agreement of November 14, 1950, providing the basis on which the United States would grant aid to the Philippines in the amount of $250,000,000. On December 15, 1950, the PHILCUSA submitted to the Council of State an interim aid program, and an allocation of $15 million was granted shortly as advance aid to the Philippines. The bilateral agreement, which is the formal treaty governing the Mutual Assistance Program, was signed April 27, 1951. The United States Congress then allocated to the Philippines another $32 million for expenditure within the 1951-1952 fiscal year. Last year it granted us another allocation of $30 million for the 1952-1953 fiscal year. In addition, the Export-Import Bank has recently granted to the National Power Corporation a loan of $20 million for the Ambuklao Hydroelectric project. The total aid thus far allocated to the Philippines since the start of the Mutual Assistance Program now amounts to $77 million in grants and $20 million in loan. Under the bilateral agreement we have to deposit P2 for each dollar of aid granted to us, to form the counterpart fund. Up to this date, our Congress has appropriated a total of P75 million for this purpose. This amount has been bolstered by counterpart funds derived from the sale of commodities, to the extent of P24,715,535 up to December 31, 1951, so that to date the total amount of the available counterpart fund is P99,715,535. A total of P44,691,267 of this counterpart fund has now been authorized to be spent on all projects under implementation.\r\nDespite the initial difficulties and obstacles inherent in a program of the size and scope of these joint entities, they have chalked up already a number of noteworthy achievements. Over 23,700 tons of fertilizers have been distributed to farmers throughout the country, estimated to increase the yield of rice, corn, fruits, and vegetables to more than P19,900,000. The culture of pure rice and corn seeds has been done on 178 hectares of land, 41 hectares of which have already been harvested. Distribution of the seeds harvested to farmers will begin soon and ought to bolster immensely the country\u2019s drive for self-sufficiency in prime cereals.\r\nPHILCUSA\u2019s assistance in the campaign against mosaic has cleared 50,287.03 hectares of abaca land of infected plants. With the rehabilitation of the U.P. College of Agriculture and the establishment of the Central Experimental Station in Los Ba\u00f1os, we now have facilities for agricultural instruction, research, and extension comparable to the best in other countries. Other MSA-PHILCUSA projects basically of a service nature just coming to the fore will improve our facilities for agricultural production, agricultural research, agricultural extension, soil survey and conservation, vocational and technical education, health programs, road development and rehabilitation, and the improvement of manpower efficiency and of production techniques and processes in industry and trade.\r\nLet us not forget that, even before the inception of the United States aid program, we had already started our own program of economic development using for that purpose the P200 million which was loaned by the Central Bank to the Government under the provisions of Section 137 of Republic Act No. 265 as Economic Development Fund. This fund was allocated to the various government projects upon the recommendation of the National Economic Council, which body likewise approved those projects that were to be undertaken, either by the government directly or through its corporations. The fund was thus distributed and eventually released as follows: (1) P74,677,090.27 to the National Power Corporation for the construction of the Lumot River Diversion Project, the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric and the Ambuklao Hydroelectric Projects; (2) P21,428,688.93 to the National Development Company for the construction of three ocean-going vessels, for advances made to the nail plant, the pulp and paper mills, the Malangas Coal Mines, and the Engineer Island shops, for subscription to shares of stock of the Philippine Electric Manufacturing Co. and the Philippine Air Lines, Inc., and for the construction of the Ilocos Textile Mills in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur; (3) P891,050 to the Cebu Portland Cement Co., to finish the construction of the pulp and paper mills; (4) P20,500,000 to the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation for the construction of the Mariveles National Shipyard and the Iligan Steel Mill project; (5) P15,000,000 to the Land Settlement and Development Corporation for its rice and corn project; (6) P1,984,400 to the Manila Railroad Company for the purchase of ten new locomotives and spare parts from Japan; (7) P10,000,000 to the Bureau of Public Works for the construction of irrigation projects; (8) P40,160,000 to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation to be used for financing agricultural and industrial projects; (9) P3,500,000 to the Department of Agricultural and Natural Resources for its fertilizer, irrigation pumps, and abaca mosaic disease projects, and (10) P1,843,170.80 to the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation for its Davao Abaca project. As of December 31, 1951, there still remained unalloted the sum of P10,015,600, which is reserved for other productive and income-producing projects.\r\nLet us now look at our national finances as they bear upon our economy.\r\nTwo years ago, we elected for ourselves a goal in the field of fiscal policy which many countries for more favored than us in resources, technical equipment, and manpower have considered unattainable in this age. I am proud to report that in the fiscal year which ended last June 30, we achieved our postwar objective of a balanced budget and were able to match expenditures with revenues.\r\nThe latest available figures from the General Auditing Office placed the total income of the National Government for the last fiscal year at P611,460,943.82, as against expenditures of P539,239,957.39. Considering the numerous spheres of government endeavor in which expansion was demanded, the excess of P72,220,986.43 of income over expenditures assumes a happier hue.\r\nWe have also progressed in the liquidation of the advances form the Special Funds. In the fiscal year 1952, repayments to the Special Funds aggregated P127,339,715.32, so that as of June 30 last year, only P25 million remained to be refunded. We are addressing ourselves to the eventual repayment of this balance and expect to do this before the close of the ensuing fiscal period.\r\nLocal government finances have also noticeably improved. Provincial and municipal governments realized an income of P74,192,000 in the fiscal year 1952. This figure compares favorably with their 1951 performance of P60,830,000. Collections of chartered cities reached P73,712,000, or an increase of P12,623,000 over the 1951 record of P61,089,000. The assessed value of taxable real property in the provinces, municipalities, and cities increased by over P176 million in a year\u2019s time.\r\nWhile the overall picture appears to be brighter than heretofore, individually, the local governments have still to exert greater efforts towards financial autonomy. Many cannot yet sustain ordinary and essential services or meet legal requirements, like that of the Minimum Wage Law, without allotments from national funds. These fiscal difficulties can be solved. Local boards and councils should early consider measures designed to tap new sources of local income, or to increase prevailing rates of local taxes and fees.\r\nThe past fiscal year saw a substantial decrease in the public debt by P132,972,858.52. From a figure of P927,327,684.44, at which it stood on June 30, 1951, the public debt has gone down to P794,354,825.92 as of June 30, 1952.\r\nWe have complied with the amortization requirements of the loans secured from the U.S. Treasury and from the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Treasury notes and treasury bills are being retired on their due dates, and we have not found it necessary to increase the flotation of such issues. In accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 800 which amended portions of the Backpay Law, partial redemption of backpay certificates is proceeding apace. About P10 million has already been disbursed in fulfillment of our commitment to loyal and deserving employees of the Government.\r\nLargely as a result of our success in maintaining domestic stability in the economy, the problem of maintaining external stability has been greatly minimized. The continuing decline in the demand for, and prices of, our export products, coupled with the many destructive typhoons which in recent months laid waste sizable areas planted to domestic and export crops, resulted in an unprecedented drop of $63 million in export receipts during the first 11 months of 1952. Such a substantial decline could have been fatal to the national economy. International reserves could have been depleted to a point where it could have been difficult to import not only vital raw materials and supplies for our industries but even many of the essentials of life. Fortunately, a reduction in imports by $72 million below that of the 1951 level and a moderate rise in United States expenditures in this country served to offset the big drop in export receipts. It was thus that international reserves have been maintained at a level that is adequate, barring unforeseen world developments and provided that we continue to observe sound fiscal and monetary policies.\r\nOn the whole, 1952 has been a year marked by great gains in economic strength, both internally and externally. Inflation, still a major problem in many countries today, and which only a few years back appeared to be impossible of solution in our country, has been checked. The retail prices and the cost of living index of wage-earners during 1952 declined substantially from the level of 1951. Consequently, the purchasing power of the peso today, not only of the middle class but also of the low-income groups, has shown definite improvement. We must conserve these gains.\r\nBut more than we realize, we stand on the verge of possible retrogression.\r\nI would like now to call special attention to the unfavorable trend which government revenues have taken since the middle part of 1952. On account of the continuing low demand for, and sustained drop of the prices of, our export products which resulted in a decline of about $63 million in export receipts during the first 11 months of 1952, total government revenue from taxation for the current fiscal year which was originally predicted at around P526 million, is now estimated to reach P474,000,000 only.\r\nThis unforeseen development will be further aggravated by the expiration this year of some of the tax laws which were purposely enacted to balance government revenues and expenditures. In addition, the foreign exchange tax will be sliced from 17 per cent to 121/2 per cent after June 30, this year.\r\nThese factors may compel the Government to resort again to deficit spending which, needless to say, is a situation that we should make every effort to avoid. The inflationary pressures which such a program would generate could easily give rise to a rapid deterioration of our international reserves (because of the augmented pressure they would exert for increase imports) or to a spiraling of prices and cost of living, or to both unsalutary conditions at the same time.\r\nTherefore, I earnestly ask you to consider favorably the extension of the tax laws which will expire this year and to retain the foreign exchange tax at its present rate of 17 per cent. This rate is much lower than the 25 per cent originally recommended by the Bell Mission which saw in the measure an alternative to the import duties that our government is unable to impose on account of the restrictive provisions of the Trade Agreement supplement to the Bell Trade Act.\r\nI cannot too strongly stress the grave aftermath likely to result from any failure to recognize the imperative need to retain these tax laws in full force. Adequate taxation is essential, both to assure a sound fiscal position and to maintain economic stability. It was principally because of the enactment of these tax measures in your first and second sessions, complemented by adequate economic, monetary, and credit policies, that we have made considerable headway in the maintenance of economic stability in our country. We should not lose now by default the victories won these past two years in the economic and fiscal fields.\r\nIn the last twelve months, the Philippines concluded treaties of friendship with Cuba and with the Dominical Republic. It also signed 14 other agreements, three of which were on civil aviation for the extension of our air routes to various countries, and eight with United Nations Agencies providing for various forms of technical assistance to the Philippines.\r\nIn view of our expanding relations with other countries, new Foreign Service posts were established; namely, a legation in New Delhi and a consulate in Guam, thereby increasing the number of our existing diplomatic missions to 13 and of our offices to 12.\r\nIn order to place our Foreign Service strictly on the merit system and thereby insure its efficiency and effectiveness, I signed Republic Act No. 708, otherwise known as the Foreign Service Act of the Philippines. The placing of diplomatic and consular personnel on a career basis with strict eligibility requirements is expected to bring about still higher performance standards among our Foreign Service personnel.\r\nLet me take up with you once more our position in connection with the Japanese Peace Treaty. The Senate did not act on the peace treat during its last session. Technically, therefore, we are still at war with that country. Our failure to normalize and stabilize our relations with Japan has stood in the way of the consolidation and strengthening of the defense of our region against the common danger that threatens the countries that comprise it.\r\nFrom the economic point of view, the uncertainty of our relations with the former enemy has not served our interest. We must stabilize these relations to take advantage among other things of our favorable balance of trade with that country, and determine how we can strengthen our national economy by taking advantage of proffers of Japanese industrial technical assistance.\r\nTo reach an early agreement on the reparations question, which is the only factor responsible for the non-ratification of the peace treaty by the Senate, the Japanese Government sent two special missions to the Philippines. I am confident that as a result of our negotiations with them and our direct dealings with the Japanese Government through our mission in Tokyo, we have made progress towards an early settlement of the reparations problem.\r\nIn compliance with our commitment to the United Nations\u2019 effort in Korea, we have maintained fighting forces in that area. As in other battlefields, the Filipino soldier has again won additional honors and prestige on that front. He is receiving citations for valiant and heroic action.\r\nUncertainties continue to hang over the international situation. We shall strive to make further provision for our national contribution towards the efforts of free nations to remain free. The improvement of our domestic situation will enable this Government to devote more time and resources to the development of our defense against threats from without, either through infiltration or through direct attack.\r\nIn 1951 we entered into a Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. In the latter part of last year a meeting was held in Manila between representatives of the United States and the Philippine governments to clarify and strengthen the roles that the United States and the Philippines would play in the defense of our territorial integrity, should any threat be poised against it, as well as in the regional security of this part of the world. This meeting also made it possible for our Government to take up possible acceleration of United States military assistance to the Philippines in accordance with our military assistance pact.\r\nWorld antagonisms notwithstanding, we are determined to contribute however modest to the maintenance of world peace and assist in the preservation of the liberties and rights of free men. From conviction we have cast our lot with the democracies.\r\nOur Government has dedicated itself to the cultivation and fostering of amicable relations with the other peoples of the world, to active participation in the efforts of the United Nations to promote human welfare and maintain world security and peace. We have urged the formation of a system for the common development and defense of the countries of our region. The past year witnessed a perceptible and significant attitude of the responsible powers towards the development of this objective. It is may hope that, in the months to come, it may be possible for the various governments concerned to meet together and work out the basic principles of this project.\r\nI have given you a picture of the important developments during the last three years of our administration. With pardonable pride I can say that they can stand comparison with the record of progress of our nation in any period of our history.\r\nIn the face of apparently insurmountable difficulties, in an atmosphere of keen partisanship, aggravated by the confusion, insurgency, and fears fomented by a new world ideology ruthlessly seeking to destroy the very foundations of democratic institutions the world over, we have shown strength of character as a people.\r\nWe have been able to put our heads together on matters calling for the highest type of statesmanship. We have achieved that in due course may be characterized as heroic against a backdrop of long and painful vicissitudes. We have established during our time a government stable in its finances and political institutions, rich in promise of yet greater deeds.\r\nBut this is a continuing process. It should leave us no time and excuse for complacency. We should and can surpass our past accomplishments and cooperating with one another, solve many of our long standing ills in our time and generation.\r\nGreat opportunities are before us, never before presented in the different epochs of our history. With our record of accomplishment, I know we can achieve better things yet. We can continue balancing our budget, prevent the recurrence of any school or rice crisis, and increase the public revenues and the national income in great measure. We can produce more consumption and export goods and manufacture the products which we have heretofore been importing. We can steadily improve our standards of living; assure greater prosperity, satisfaction, and happiness to the masses of our people, individually and collectively. We can attain greater honors by more heroic action in foreign battlefields. We can even say that, in our time, we can write in letters of gold the name of the Republic of the Philippines for our children to cherish.\r\nBut all this would be set at naught will have no meaning, and our efforts will be in vain, if we do not employ care and vigilance in the preservation of what we hold dear in our heart and soul as a people. For, in our very midst there are influences not only undermining our stability as a nation but actually destroying the very principles upon which our nation has been founded\u2014our freedom, our democratic institutions, and the way of life we have discovered to be the real source of our happiness.\r\nThese destructive influences are active. They always speak to blood baths and revolution. They are determined to overthrow the government and turning their back on the noble sacrifices of our heroes and martyrs, are bent on delivering us to a new power which will ultimately enslave us and our children.\r\nWe must stand united to fight them and those who fight for them, if we are to survive as a nation and deliver our precious heritage to the succeeding generations.\r\nWe must not be deluded by temporary or personal advantage into allowing these enemies of our freedom and happiness to avail themselves of the confused, precarious atmosphere where they expect to thrive at the cost of our future.\r\nWe must give no quarter to them in the open field, in the mountain fastnesses, in the courts, in the press, and even over the radio. Before they destroy us, let us face them and conquer them, face them fraternally if they come to reason and to the folds of the law, and face them as our worst enemy in time of national peril, if they don\u2019t.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1948-01-26 01:15:04+00:00", "author": "Manuel Roxas", "text": "[Delivered at Manila on January 26, 1948]\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nBarely twenty months have passed since you and I took, our oaths of office; only a year and a half since our Republic was inaugurated. The progress we have achieved during that brief period has been described by foreign observers as the only bright opening in the heavy clouds of misery and chaos that ominously gather over the greater portion of the world. The great strides towards social and economic reconstruction we have made cannot be doubted. To do so would be like denying the dawn by merely turning down the lights.\r\nIn my first message to the Congress on the state of the nation, I drew a picture\u2013necessarily a dark picture\u2013of the tragic conditions confronting us. Last year I informed you that the crisis had not passed, but that there were hopeful indications of progress ahead. Today, I am glad to report that the crisis has passed, and that our program of rehabilitation is far advanced. Conditions among our people have been ameliorated. There is relative prosperity in our land. By the boldness and resolution, which you showed in immediately grappling with the tremendous problems which we faced, you have rendered eminent and imperishable service to the nation. The people, I am sure, will give you credit for the major part you played in the promotion of their welfare. As for me, I deeply appreciate your cooperation in the past. I trust you will accord me the same cooperation now and in the future.\r\nProperly to appraise the progress of a nation is not an easy task. It is difficult fully to estimate the extent and significance, material and psychological, of the advances made. Many factors producing these results are dynamic in nature and, once set in motion, create a chain of cumulative effects which stimulate activity and progress in many fields.\r\nThere are, however, well-known and accepted indices of a nation\u2019s life, not unlike the symptoms discoverable through a medical examination of a man\u2019s health, that reveal equally unerringly the state of health of a nation. By an objective application of certain tests, we will learn the true state of our nation as well as the progress that has been attained. This I propose to do in this report, as accurately and as frankly as I can, without passion nor the least reluctance to admit organic weaknesses or failures to cure some of our ailments.\r\nFor fear of being misunderstood, I wish to state at the outset that we have not yet reached all our goals. We have a long way to travel, requiring wisdom and sturdiness of character and an unshakeable determination to gain the highest summits of security and well-being we crave for the people of our land. This upward climb will never end, for we will always keep on struggling for higher peaks of peace and happiness for us and for all men.\r\nThe tests I have mentioned or the questions we must answer, are these:\r\nDo we have a government born of the nation\u2019s will? Does that government receive acceptance and respect of the whole nation? Is the government functioning in accordance with the Constitution? Is its existence threatened by wide- spread movements either to subvert its foundations or radically to change its basic ideology?\r\nOur present government can easily pass this test. It was established by the will of the people under a Constitution approved by them. It is functioning strictly in accordance with the powers and inhibitions prescribed in that document. Constitutional processes have been completely reestablished. In the past year we have advanced from a state of emergency into the plenitude of constitutional normalcy. Our citizens as well as foreigners living within our gates look upon the present government as the only repository of public authority and are rendering it respect and support. There are no serious popular movements that either weaken or threaten its stability. It is true that we have a group of misguided men in Central Luzon who disturb the nation\u2019s peace in their desire to change through force our basic institutions. But the number of these men is so small, and the support they receive from the people so unwilling and so meager that they cannot be considered a threat to the security of the established order.\r\n.-Is the free exercise of individual rights guaranteed to the lowliest citizen of our land? Are we maintaining a free press, untrammelled by censorship or any punitive action of government? Are religious liberty, the right to think and the right to criticize the government, being maintained? Is there purging in the Government? Are there concentration camps where political adversaries of those in power are tortured and liquidated?\r\nMy answer to this test is that there is no country in the world today where the people enjoy more individual freedom, especially freedom of the press, of speech and of religion, than the Philippines. We impose no censorship on either the spoken or the written word. As a matter of fact, our efforts to suppress completely dissident elements are necessarily delayed because the government is adhering scrupulously to the limitations of the Constitution intended to safeguard individual rights from the abuses of government. Before the law, the humblest man in this country is the equal of the most powerful. The widest freedom of criticism against the government not only is not curtailed I but is encouraged by those who are in power. The fullest toleration of religious worship exists. Side by side with our Mohammedan brothers and others of varied faiths forgetting religious differences, we are united in a common effort to support and defend the government we ourselves have established. Our courts of justice stand sentinel day and night to prevent the least invasion of individual rights. These courts constitute a coordinate branch of government, independent of the Executive and of the Congress, and are in no manner whatever subservient or answerable to either of them.\r\nHow many of the nations of the world today could claim for their people the freedoms that our citizens enjoy? Survey the face of the earth and I am sure you will find that in many countries individual liberty is being directly or indirectly encroached upon, if not entirely denied, and that the lives of citizens are strictly being regimented to sub serve the interest of the State.\r\nIn the Philippines we take individual freedom for granted. That is the reason many of us fail to realize the priceless boon we possess. But our memory is short. Only three years ago we lived under a different regime, a regime under which the freedoms that we cherish were refused to us. We were not free citizens then; we were subjects of a tyrannical power that blotted our personal dignity and trampled upon our liberty. Today, we enjoy our liberties to the fullest measure and I thank God that we can now stand and walk erect as free men, the equal of the mightiest on this earth.\r\n.-Is justice being administered impartially, without fear or favor? Do we maintain a free, honest and independent judiciary? Do we enable our poorest citizen to resort to the courts for the enforcement of his rights or the redress of his grievances?\r\nA judicious answer to these questions is in the affirmative. Our judiciary is competent and honest. We are maintaining the great traditions established under the leadership of the immortal Cayetano Arellano. The courts are free. They are open to all. They are not subservient to any other department of the government. All judicial decisions are respected and enforced. Judges are appointed for life and can only be removed for bad behavior. Here, no judge is answerable to anyone for his decisions rendered in accordance with his conscience. The judiciary is free from politics. Appointments are made on the basis of merit and character. Thus, judges are being appointed from among lawyers belonging to different parties in the confidence that-and this confidence has not been in vain\u2013when a judge sits on his rostrum he will forget politics and personal considerations in the discharge of his sworn duty to do justice to every man. Under the Constitution the enforcement or vindication of individual rights is the chief function of the courts. We will continue to enjoy our liberties so long as we have independent courts and courageous judges who will relentlessly battle for the preservation of those liberties. We have such courts and such judges today. I trust we will always have them in the future.\r\n.-Are the people secure in their lives and property? Does peace and order prevail?\r\nAt the beginning of this administration lawlessness and widespread criminality prevailed in practically every province and section of our country. Robberies, kidnappings, and daylight assaults on passenger or cargo buses and trucks as well as trains, were practically daily occurrences. Today complete peace and order exists in 90 per cent of our national territory. More than 200 thousand firearms, have been surrendered or captured since our assumption of the people\u2019s trust. This alone is a great achievement. True, in a few sections of Central and Southern Luzon roving bands of bandits and communist-led groups who have defied the government still remain, but their activities are now confined to distant barrios. Our peace officers, principally the Constabulary, are giving them neither rest nor quarter. The efforts to apprehend them will be intensified. We can no longer compromise with these men. Any efforts at appeasement will just encourage them to continue their criminal activities. They are using force. We have to meet them with force. They are not fighting for social reforms. Their most important demands have already been met. Now we know their aim is one and definitive\u2013to gain power through. For whatever measures the government may take m the direction of a more rapid amelioration of the economic and social conditions of the tenants whom they pretend to champion-which improvement of conditions, I know, is your great desire as well as mine\u2013will prove futile and in vain toward making these, enemies of the law come to reason. These elements would continue with their criminal designs until they succeed in wresting the reins of government from the lawfully elected representatives of the people. Their loyalty is not to the Philippines. Their ambition is not to promote the interest of a social group. That is a camouflage, for the tenants whose interest they claim to defend are the very victims of their depredations and atrocities: The pattern of their operations is too familiar to deceive anyone. It is the same pattern used in other countries by groups boring from within to undermine democratic institutions. Their methods are to create social disorder, confusion and chaos, to obstruct national progress, to produce shortages of food and other necessities, to foster widespread discontent and to drive the people to a state of desperation.\r\nThey will not succeed in our land. Their numbers are few and rapidly dwindling. If their aims were noble and sincere, why did they have to go underground to defy the government and resort to force? Has the government done anything which would give them the least reason to fear that under our democracy they would be prevented from laboring for the social reforms which they are supposedly to have in mind? They can find no reason for harboring such fear. There is no reform, social or political, which cannot be peacefully secured under our domestic institutions, if it is supported by a majority of the people. Were they men of patriotism and noble ambitions, they should have the courage to return to the processes of the law and face trial before the courts of our land for the crimes they have committed. But as long as they continue defying the government, trying to destroy our every effort to promote the strength and the glory of this Republic and to insure the happiness of our people, we must look upon them as the enemies of our nation. We must deal with them as such. We shall endeavor with all the means at our command to bring them to justice and wipe out to the last vestige every attempt to overthrow our free institutions or disturb the peace in our land.\r\nAre we secure from outside aggression?\r\nNo country in the world, not even the most powerful, can set up a system of national defense which would in itself be adequate to withstand any possible attack. The adequacy of defense is always relative, depending upon the combined strength of the attacking forces. We can never hope to establish a defensive system that will be theoretically impregnable. Our best security is in the success of the plans and efforts of the United Nations organization for the maintenance of world peace. We are actively cooperating with such program. Our representative in that organization has gained for himself and for our nation world recognition as champions of peace and the freedom of subject peoples.\r\nBut we have not relied exclusively upon the United Nations for the security of our country. That organization is still in its infancy and we do not know whether it will succeed in gaining the necessary strength to impose peace on the world. We have, therefore, bent every energy to build up a system of defense upon which we may rely in the event\u2013which we hope will not happen\u2013that the United Nations should fail to achieve its aims. We cannot forget the terrible ordeal we underwent during the past war. We must be resolved to avoid a repetition of that experience. To this end we have concluded a treaty with the United States of America for the establishment of American military and naval bases in the Philippines for the common protection of our two countries. We are also maintaining a small military force to consist ultimately of not more than 17,000 men, including the army, the air force, and the naval patrol, which will serve as the nucleus and rallying center of our citizen army which will gradually be built up to a strength capable of denying our shores to an invader. In addition to our armed forces, will maintain a well-trained and well-equipped Constabulary with a strength of around 12,000 men. At present these two forces number 35,000 men.\r\nThis year, we shall resume military training of our citizens. By June we shall begin training 3,000 men. This number will be gradually increased, as fast as we can provide the necessary facilities for the trainees, until we reach a rate of 12,000 men a year. The purpose of this program is to give us, after a course of years, a citizen army that will be subject to call in an emergency with a strength totaling eight divisions and an adequate number of trained pilots and ground crews to man and service our combat and transport planes. The ROTC training in the universities and colleges is proceeding in accordance with approved plans. We have now in stock sufficient weapons and ammunition including rolling stock for present needs.\r\nThis military blueprint has been formulated in accordance with plans adopted with the advice of the United States Military Advisory Group assigned to us upon our request. This mission is also planning the training program of our reserves.\r\nThe cost of our military establishment represents a substantial percentage of our national revenues. It is a great drain on our resources. The expenditure will have to be increased when the training program starts. But much as we dislike to spend such a large sum for an unproductive activity as the Army is, we cannot neglect this minimum requirement for our defense.\r\nWith the effectuation of our defense program, and pro- vided we continue maintaining our close and friendly relations with the United States and carefully adhere to the terms of the Treaty on Military Bases, it is my considered judgment that we can be reasonably confident of our national security.\r\n.-Do we maintain friendly relations with other countries? Are we complying with our international obligations and commitments?\r\nIt is most gratifying for me to report that our Republic, so recently inaugurated, now counts upon the actual or implied recognition of more than 50 nations. And we are enjoying the friendship of all of them. We have already concluded treaties of amity with the United States of America, China, France, Italy, and Spain, and have signed 27 other treaties and agreements with different countries. Most of these treaties are with the United States, involving military bases, trade relations, air agreements, a consular convention, conciliation, surplus property and property formerly owned by enemy nationals. Presently, we are discussing commercial treaties with a number of other powers.\r\nI am also happy to report that we do not face any existing difficulty or misunderstanding with other countries. We have given them no cause for complaint. We have no grievance or dispute with any of them. I trust this happy situation will continue.\r\nWe are fulfilling to the letter all our international obligations. We are complying with every commitment we have made. Our prestige and credit abroad is growing every day.\r\nWe are participating actively in many international organizations, in addition to our membership in the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are now members of the Trusteeship Council, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Commission on Human Rights, the Sub-commission on Freedom of Information and the Press, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the International Trade Organization, the International Labor Organization, and, recently, the Korean and the Palestine Commissions. This is a great privilege for a young and small country such as ours. I believe sincerely that this recognition is due to the fact that our Republic during its short existence has gained the respect and confidence of the nations of the world. I am happy to state that this achievement has been accomplished in large measure through the good-will tour around the world of the Vice-President and to his brilliant leadership in our foreign affairs.\r\nOur relations with the United States remain on a most cordial and friendly basis. The American Government is giving every evidence of its continued interest in our welfare. We appreciate the cooperative spirit of United States Ambassador Emmet O\u2019Neal, and the heads of the Armed Forces and other agencies of the American Government. We have every assurance of a sympathetic consideration by the American Congress and the American Government of all questions affecting the Philippines. Our Ambassador in Washington undoubtedly deserves high credit for the maintenance of these close and cordial relations. He is representing our government with great dignity and ability. I do not know who could do better. I have great confidence that he will be able to obtain favorable action on many of our requests pending in Washington, such as those for loans for economic reconstruction and industrial development, veterans\u2019 legislation and other important matters.\r\nThe fact that Baguio is gaining favor as the seat of international conferences is indicative of the worldwide interest in Philippine affairs, and of friendliness toward our people.\r\n.-Is the government maintaining a reasonably adequate fiscal position ? Are our government revenues increasing at a rate which gives hope that within a reasonably short period we shall be able to finance all our ordinary expenditures with current revenues and thereby balance our budget? Is the Government meeting its financial obligations in accordance with its commitments?\r\nOne of the greatest accomplishments of this Republic during the past twenty months is the marked improvement of the financial position of our government. When we took office, we found the government groaning under a large deficit. At that time revenue collections were proceeding only at the rate of around 57 million pesos a year. The appropriation expenditures totalled 228 million pesos. You will recall that immediately upon my inauguration, I appeared before you to apprise you of the precarious situation of the treasury. I recommended to you the approval of certain tax measures and a budgetary loan from the United States. Your ready support of my recommendations tided us over that critical period. The United States Government, through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, granted us a loan amounting to 140 million pesos. When I was assured of an upward trend in revenue collections, we paid back 20 million pesos of this loan shortly after it had been granted. This action gained for us the confidence of our creditors and greatly enhanced our credit.\r\nOn August 5, 1946, I informed the Congress that our estimated general fund income for the fiscal year 1946-1947 was 75.5 million pesos. This estimate was subsequently revised upwards. Actual collections reached 170 million pesos. I must mention that in addition there was also received 62 million pesos from extraordinary sources and from reversions from special funds, together with approximately 39 million pesos collected for apportionment to the local governments and for accrual to special funds ear- marked by law for specific purposes.\r\nOn June 30, 1947, the general fund registered a surplus of 64.4 million pesos, largely because of the improved collections and the 120-million-peso loan we received from the United States.\r\nFor the current fiscal year the general fund revenue collections have been estimated at 180 million pesos. This amount does not include internal revenue collections to be apportioned to local governments, those accruing to special funds and the like. It is now the belief of the Department of Finance that the general fund collections will reach as high as 210 million pesos.\r\nDespite this great and rapid increase in collections, how- ever, our yearly revenues are not yet sufficient to cover the total appropriations for the ordinary expenditures which you have approved. This we must endeavor to accomplish during the next fiscal year. I ask you to consider the tax measures recommended by the National Economic Council and the Joint Financial Commission. At the same time I urge you to practice the severest economy in the approval of appropriations. We must adopt a firm determination to raise our general fund revenues to around 275 million pesos. We must equally be resolved to confine our over-all expenditures chargeable to that fund strictly within that amount. Should we be able to do this, and I am convinced it can be done without sacrificing indispensable services, we shall have balanced our budget and achieved what is considered almost a miracle during this post-war period.\r\nConsiderable progress has also been made in the fiscal rehabilitation of the local governments. Upon the reconstitution of the Commonwealth, it was inevitable that local governments should be assisted in their initial operating needs. In 1946, the National Government gave 32 million pesos to local governments to meet their ordinary operating expenses. Such aid, however, was intended to be temporary, to last only until these governments could completely be reestablished. When this was accomplished, I asked the provinces, chartered cities and municipalities to intensify the collection of their revenues. There was need of adopting a graduated program of diminishing reliance upon the National Government for ordinary operating expenses. Fiscal recovery was thus given definite direction and objective. In 1947, only a little over 13 million pesos was required for the purpose. For 1948, five million pesos has been appropriated to provide for assistance where it may still be needed in special provinces and in those heavily devastated by the war. Today, with the exception of ten provinces and one chartered city, local governments have registered surpluses in their general fund and other accounts.\r\nWhile we are making these long strides towards fiscal rehabilitation, we are not neglecting either our public debt or our other contractual obligations. We are rapidly paying in full treasury vouchers issued and contractual commitments made before the war. We have set aside funds for the liquidation of legally issued Philippine National Bank notes. I am just awaiting legislative authority to redeem those notes. We have 30 million pesos earmarked for the, redemption of guerrilla currencies. The registration of these issues as required by the Congress is about to be completed. At an early date I will be able to submit to you the report of the Registration Committee for your consideration. We also have 10 million pesos set aside for the redemption of the emergency currency issued at the inception of the last war.\r\nOur net outstanding indebtedness for bonds floated both within and without the Philippines amounted to P62,964;649.98 as of June 30,1947. This total is the difference between their original face value of P124,507,000 and the accumulated sinking funds provided for their redemption which on the same date amounted to P61,542,350.02.\r\nOut of this net bonded debt of P62,964,649.98, P53,112,214.75 pertains to bonds sold prior to May 1, 1934. Under Section 6(g)-(4) of the Philippine Independence Act, the Philippine Government was required to pay to the United States Treasury on July 4, 1946, the full amount of the outstanding bonds issued prior to May 1, 1934. This requirement could not be complied with, considering the situation of our treasury on the date of our independence. We were even in arrears in the payment of the sinking funds for said bonds, although we were up-to-date in the payment of the interest, the same having been continued during the war period without interruption. The arrearages in the sinking fund contributions amounted on June 30, 1947, to P18,007,000.77. That deficiency has since then been remedied by the transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of P10,156,000 worth of investments in bonds of the Financial Interest Protection Bond Fund and of P12,539,500 of United States Treasury bonds held as investments of the general fund to guarantee the safety of pre-war military equipment loaned to the Philippines by the United States, or a total of P22,695,500. We are consequently up-to-date now in the payment of interest and contributions to the sinking funds on our dollar bonds issued prior to May 1, 1934.\r\nWith reference to the settlement of the balance of this portion of our bonded debt as required by the Independence Act, I now desire to report to you that the United States Government has generously agreed to give us time for the compliance of this commitment. I have concluded negotiations with the United States Treasury for the full settlement of this account by annual payments which will liquidate both principal and interest accruals thereon not later than January 1, 1952.\r\nWe are in arrears in interest and amortizations to sinking funds on our peso bonds which are mostly held in the Philippines. These arrearages amounted as of June 30, 1947, to P2,917,853.45. They will be paid as soon as the moratorium is lifted.\r\n.-Do we have a stable currency, providing a medium of exchange acceptable to other nations of the world?\r\nOur currency is one of our most valuable economic assets. The ready convertibility of the peso to the dollar places the Philippines in a very advantageous position vis-a-vis most other countries of the world. The Philippine peso is accepted everywhere in terms of the American dollar. The same cannot be said even of the pound sterling, and certainly not of the franc, the peseta, the lira, or the yen. I am, therefore, gratified to report today that the decision you made in approving the Trade Agreement with the United States, whereby you linked the peso to the dollar for a 28-year period, was a decisive factor in bringing us to the level of prosperity and economic and social advancement where we are today. When I recall that your action on this matter was taken in the face of a strong and bitter opposition by certain articulate elements of our population, I am strengthened in my belief that the fate of our nation is secure in your hands.\r\nI cannot urge too strongly upon you the need of maintaining the stability of our currency. It is the cornerstone of our economic structure. I, for one, will do my part in defending it. I can visualize far into the future, twenty-six years hence, when the leaders of our people are called upon to pass on the question, that they will be so profoundly convinced of the benefits the nation has derived from the stability of our present currency that they will doubtless decide to maintain and continue the relationship between the peso and the dollar.\r\n.-Do we suffer from shortages of food, clothing and housing facilities?\r\nThere is no shortage, and no rationing of food or of clothing in the Philippines today. I do not expect that shortages will occur in the foreseeable future. As a matter of fact, provided we accelerate further our food production program, we may expect a surplus of some food articles for export.\r\nWe have greatly increased our rice production during the last two agricultural years. We assumed office in the face of an acute rice shortage, particularly in the Manila area. We were constrained to resort to rationing. With great difficulty we succeeded in importing sufficient rice to meet our national requirements until the next harvest. We also immediately undertook an intensive food production campaign and granted crop loans to rice producers. Even if the government should fail to collect part of these loans, the resulting losses, if any, would not be large, and the amount not recovered would be but a small price to pay for having prevented starvation and distress among our people. Today, despite the many typhoons and floods that swept our country during the past year, we can rest assured that our population will not suffer from a food shortage. Many areas in our country are now producing rice where rice had never been grown before. The same thing could be said of corn. Vegetables are more abundant and the supply of fish is growing every day. The supply of pork is likewise ample. The production of poultry and eggs is also increasing. True we have a shortage of beef. It is possible that there might be a scarcity of this item in the coming months. But we can import beef and adopt other measures to prevent an acute shortage.\r\nThe NARIC today holds a reserve of over a million bags of rice. This is more than sufficient to supply any deficiency that might occur during the next six months. For the second half of this year, we have allocations of rice from abroad which, together with our production, will fully cover our national requirements.\r\nWith regard to textiles, we have not only a sufficient supply but even a substantial surplus over present demands.\r\nThere is a shortage of housing facilities in Manila and a few other metropolitan centers. This shortage the government is solving, first, by the extension of liberal credit facilities to house builders through the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation; second, by the adoption of a housing program soon to be started, whereby houses for laborers and small-salaried employees will be built and leased at nominal cost. There is no housing shortage in the country at large.\r\nSufficiency of food supply as well as of clothing and shelter for the masses of our population is another accomplishment we can justly take pride in. No other war-devastated country, and much less countries that were battlefields in the last war and occupied by the enemy, can today boast of a similar situation. There is hunger and starvation in many lands today. We have every reason to be grateful that because of the resourcefulness of our people and the efforts of our government we have succeeded in solving this vital problem.\r\n.-Have we checked inflation and turned the tide towards a gradual deflationary process? Is the purchasing power of the peso commensurate with the world price level? Is the cost of living gradually declining, there- by increasing the purchasing power of wages?\r\nInflation is a post-war plague depressing the economy of nations and the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the world. Inflation remains unchecked and is in fact growing worse every day in many foreign countries. In our country we are fortunate that we have succeeded not only in arresting inflation but in starting the deflationary trend. This we have done by stimulating increased production and by temporarily encouraging imports which tend to absorb excess purchasing power as fast as possible. While it is necessary that inflation should be controlled, the deflationary process should not be allowed to proceed too rapidly In the same way that we effectively checked inflation, we must do our best to control the speed of deflation. Failure to do so would disrupt our national economy, set back the progress of reconstruction and development, and bring suffering to our people. By the use of effective controls we will avoid this danger. It will be my privilege to submit to you at this session legislative proposals to that end.\r\nThe cost of living has gone down considerably during the past year. Statistics show that the cost of food and clothing in the Philippines has dropped 190 per cent (sic) in the price index since 1946, but the cost of living is still three times the pre-war level. This is a most significant achievement. The Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the National Trading Corporation, now the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration, the National Cooperatives Administration, and the National Rice and Corn Corporation have contributed in large, measure to the attainment of this result. Profiteering during the periods of shortages of essential commodities was greatly minimized by the intervention of these government agencies. The commandeering of critical articles such as milk, flour and roofing materials was often resorted to in order to prevent an exorbitant rise in their prices. While the cost of living has markedly decreased, wages have been maintained at the previous level. This resulted in the increase of the purchasing power of the wages received, which in the last analysis is equivalent to an increase in the wage-level.\r\nI shall cite just a few figures to prove my assertion that the cost of living has considerably declined since 1946. I shall refer to prices of basic foodstuffs and other commodities as well as to prices of construction and building materials usually considered in determining the index of the cost of living for any nation. The following are the figures:\r\nJan. 24, Jan.

Living costs are still too high. I trust that with the efforts now employed by the government, implemented by an intensification of agricultural and industrial production, we shall be able in the near future to come to a more satisfactory level of prices.\r\nThe lowering of prices has resulted in a higher standard of living of our people. Today, the majority of our countrymen are eating more and better food than in 1946, and I have reasons to believe that the larger portion of our population are eating more and better food now than in 1941 when the war started.\r\nThe Philippines is one of the very few countries in the world today where food is not rationed. I believe we shall not find it necessary to do so in the days to come.\r\nAre we suffering from acute unemployment? Are laborers receiving a living wage? Are we reasonably free from strikes or other industrial conflicts?\r\nWe are still suffering from unemployment. It is not so acute as it was a year and a half-ago but we have not yet succeeded in putting to work all of our available labor supply. There are, however, clear indications of an increase in employment.\r\nThousands of our countrymen are now working in gainful employment not only in our country but also in some islands of the Pacific. We have about 12,000 laborers in Guam and 1,500 in Saipan. In 1941, our census reveals, 1,347,993 persons were unemployed. Today the estimates of the Bureau of the Census and Statistics show that we have only 1,200,000 unemployed. It is my hope that with the establishment of the proposed new industries and the expansion of our agricultural production, we shall be able to give employment to a large number of our laborers who are now unemployed, at satisfactory wages.\r\nWages throughout the Philippines have increased about three times the wages before the war. In 1946, the cost of living was so high that the purchasing power of wages did not permit a laborer to acquire with his earnings the same needed commodities which he could purchase in 1941 at the then existing rate. It is thus understandable why laborers were clamoring for higher wages. But there was this difficulty to a sudden and large increase in the wage level-most employers could not pay higher wages and continue profitable operation. There was also the danger that higher wages would discourage new capital investments essential to the creation of opportunities for wider employment.\r\nWith the lowering of the cost of living, the condition of the wage earner has been greatly improved. Living costs today average about three times those before the war. The level of wages is also three times the pre-war level. We have, therefore, reached a fair relationship between wages and the cost of living. This gain is vital and should be consolidated and in every way improved in the interest of the workers. One of two things could be done: either bring about a reasonable increase in wages or further reduce living costs. I, for one, favor both these courses that we may secure for all our laborers a decent livelihood.\r\nWhat I have stated with regard to laborers should be applied to low-salaried employees. Government and business and industry are in duty bound, within the limits of their financial capacity, to increase the earnings of their laborers and low-salaried employees, at least, while the cost of living remains high.\r\nI am glad to inform you that during the past year we did not have serious strikes. Through the intervention of the Department of Labor and the Court of Industrial Relations, industrial conflicts were speedily settled. The Department of Labor alone had settled 72 out of 81 industrial disputes brought to it for conciliation. Nine were endorsed to the Court of Industrial Relations and disposed of by that court. I trust that labor unions will be convinced of the deep sympathy which the government holds for them. They should have an abiding faith that the government will use every effort to gain for them every just and reasonable concession from their employers.\r\n.-Is the national income in- creasing in volume and in value ? How do our imports compare with our exports? Are we maintaining a reason- able equation in our balance of payments? Does a reason- able percentage of the national income go to the formation of capital and is that capital being invested in productive enterprises?\r\nAccording to government statistics and the estimates made by the Joint Financial Commission, our national income has increased from around 2 billion pesos before the war to over 3 billion pesos today. The volume of our national production, however, is still probably less than pre-war although with the rehabilitation of the sugar industry and some of our mines, which is proceeding at a rapid pace, we may reasonably expect that by the end of this year we will have surpassed our production before the war.\r\nThe balance of trade is still against us by a large margin. We buy today over half a billion pesos more than we sell abroad. Although our exports have materially increased since 1946, showing a total of more than P440,000,000 for the year 1947, our imports for the same year have exceeded P1,004,000,000. However, our 1947 export total is around 41 per cent over our exports immediately before the war and 240 per cent over that of 1946. Presently, our unfavorable trade balance is more than covered by payments received from the United States in the form of war damages, veterans\u2019 pensions, expenditures of the American Army, Navy, and Air Force. These compensating payments are not permanent. Some of them will cease within five years. At that time our export trade must meet the cost of our imports. With the expected increase in our exports, to be implemented by legislation which I propose to recommend I to Congress, I am confident we shall be able to narrow down gradually the adverse balance of trade against us.\r\nUnder normal conditions, capital formation in a country proceeds at the rate of around 20 per cent of the national income. The figures I have at hand show that this percentage is exceeded in the Philippines today. I also have figures indicating that more than 20 per cent of the national income has been spent in reconstruction and economic development during the past year. This is a sound situation. It shows that economic reconstruction and development is I proceeding at a relatively normal pace.\r\n.-Are we discharging our obligation ordained by the Constitution to provide educational opportunities for our youth? Do we maintain a reasonably efficient system of sanitation throughout the country for the protection of the health of our inhabitants? Are we reasonably free from epidemics and plagues? Do we provide hospitals and medical service to our people?\r\nBefore the war, we had two million students in the public schools. Today our enrollment is around three and one-half million. Our expenditures for public education have, risen from 30 million pesos to 65 million pesos. Nevertheless, we have not yet succeeded in providing educational facilities for all children of school age but we are very rapidly approaching that goal. I trust we shall be able to increase our appropriation for the Department of Education in the coming fiscal year. We shall probably have to cope with the problem of financing the opening of around 3,000 more extension classes to accommodate around 240,000 expected additional enrollment. How far we can meet the financial burden that this program entails will largely depend upon the willingness of Congress to approve new tax measures calculated to produce the additional required revenue.\r\nOur sanitary system is functioning efficiently. We have been free of epidemics and plagues during the past year. c :, At the same time we are systematically eradicating malaria ,!~ and waging a more intensive campaign against tuberculosis. II; We have created a new Bureau of Hospitals for the purpose of better coordinating the functions and raising the efficiency of our city and provincial hospitals. During the fiscal year 1946-1947, we administered 1,824,240 treatments in our dispensaries. There is still much to be done in connection with these services but I believe we are moving in the right direction. Our aim is ultimately to provide hospital facilities to the people of every province and municipality in our country.\r\n.-Are we taking care of the heroic veterans of the war and the widows and orphans of our dead soldiers to the limit of our resources ?\r\nYes, we are. We cannot afford to neglect the men who fought and the families of those who died for our country during the darkest period of our history.\r\nWe continue to pay pensions to our veterans of the Revolution. A larger number of veterans are now receiving pensions than before the war.\r\nAs to the veterans of the last World War, we are taking care of the disabled and many of those who need hospitalization. We are also giving educational benefits to veterans who have chosen to enroll in public or private schools, universities and colleges. We are paying to the widows of our dead soldiers \u201950 a month and in addition \u201910 for each child. We are now paying tuition fees for over 10,000 veterans. We are now giving pensions to more than 20,000. widows and orphans and indigent parents. We care for about 1,000 disabled and sick soldiers. These expenditures amount to approximately \u2018800,000 a month. Our total expenditures for the Philippine Veterans Board will amount to around 12 million pesos this year. I trust that very soon the major part of these expenditures will be taken over by the U. S. Veterans Administration. I feel that we are doing the best we can within the limit of our resources for the welfare of the veterans of the last war.\r\n.-Are we revising our substantive laws, especially our Codes, to insure that they are in harmony with Filipino customs and with present-day tendencies?\r\nLast March I created a Code Commission to revise our old codes and to draft new codes of substantive law that will be more in conformity with Filipino customs, the modern trends in legislation, and the progressive principles of law. The Commission commenced the preparation of the Civil Code on May 8, and finished this most difficult task on December 15, 1947. The printing of the draft is about to be completed. As soon as this draft and the report of the Commission explaining the philosophy of the suggested reforms are printed, I will present them to the Congress. I take the liberty of recommending that you hold public hearings on this great piece of legislation to stimulate the widest possible discussion of its provisions.\r\nI have reasons to expect that the Commission will be able to finish another code-the Penal Code-in time for submission to you at your regular session next year. The proposed Commercial Code will be completed before June 30, 1949. The Commission deserves high commendation for the speed in the performance of its delicate tasks.\r\n.-Bank deposits have more than doubled in comparison with pre-war figures. As of June 30, 1941, bank deposits in the Philippines amounted to P228,512,000. As of December 27, 1947, bank deposits reached P566,116,000. Bank loans as of June 30, 1941, amounted to P213,601,000. As of December 27, 1947, bank loans totalled P349,470,000.\r\nLife insurance policies, exclusive of the Government Service Insurance System, issued during 1940, had a total value of P42,161,309. For the year 1946, the total value of insurance policies issued was P106,639,050. I am informed that the present total value of life insurance policies is over 130 million pesos.\r\nGovernment expenditures for public works during the past year, including expenditures of United States funds for rehabilitation of public buildings, roads and port facilities, total approximately 125 million pesos.\r\nBuilding construction costs in Manila and in the provinces, including rehabilitation of factories, mines and agricultural facilities. are estimated at more than 300 million pesos. The official records in Manila alone show an expenditure of P73,907,248 during the year 1947. The number of motor vehicles registered as of November, 1947, totalled 73,562 compared to less than 50,000 in 1941.\r\nThe number of passengers and the amount of freight carried by the Manila Railroad are much less than the pre-war totals. But the rolling stock of the line when it \u201d was returned to us by the United States Army in February, 1946, was only 40 per cent of its pre-war number. Today 60 per cent of the pre-war trackage has been rehabilitated. The passengers and freight carried by the railroad in 1947 were almost double the 1946 figures. The number of Filipino citizens and companies now engaged in the retail trade has already surpassed the pre- war figures. In 1941 there were 50,771. During the year 1947 Filipino nationals duly licensed to engage in the retail trade numbered 55,207. It is believed that the figure for this year is much larger.\r\nAir passengers, embarking and disembarking in Manila, both for local and foreign trips, have increased a hundred- fold since 1941.\r\nThe creation of the Manila International Airport by executive order became imperative because of this ever- increasing international air traffic. The United States Government has already returned to us the airport at Nichols Field. It is our hope make Manila the hub of air transportation in the Far East.\r\nThere are perhaps less important items that could be, considered to show the progress which the Republic has achieved during the past twenty months. Those that have been mentioned, however, are sufficient to convince any i; intelligent and impartial student of the reality and extent of that progress.\r\nShould we apply these tests to actual conditions in four- fifths of the nations of the world, despite the tremendous financial and material aids that have already been given to them, we will find, I am certain, convincing evidence of the unparalleled progress we have made since liberation. The statesmen of the world have now come to the conclusion that unless more and greater aid and assistance is given to them, the peace of the earth would be disturbed because the peoples of those nations would undergo acute human suffering. On our part, we have endeavored to solve, and I believe we have succeeded in solving, most of our difficulties and problems through our own efforts and sacrifices. It is true we have received some assistance from the United States of America; but it cannot be denied that if .we have succeeded at all, it is mainly because of the fortitude shown by our people under the calamitous circumstances from which we have emerged.\r\nI shall not attempt to burden you further with a detailed report of the activities of the different departments of our j government. I have already referred to them in many respects in the course of my exposition of our present t conditions. These reports are available to you upon your request.\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\nIn order to accelerate further our rehabilitation, to expand our productivity, to strengthen our fiscal position, and to develop our national economy, I shall now enumerate the legislative proposals which I earnestly recommend to you for consideration at this session. I shall not undertake to explain these proposals in detail. I shall take the liberty of submitting them to you in separate messages.\r\nThe measures I recommend are the following:\r\n1. An Act establishing the Central Bank, defining its powers in the administration of the monetary system, amending the corresponding provisions of the Administrative Code, and for other purposes.\r\n2. A law granting to the President, under such conditions as the Congress may impose, authority to control imports and to increase or decrease from time to time the sales tax on luxuries, semi-luxuries and non-essential commodities up to 100 per cent of the present rates, but in no case to be less than the rates now imposed. This measure is intended to raise revenue, conserve our dollar exchange resources, and to channel surplus purchasing power towards productive investments.\r\n3. A law appropriating the proceeds of certain loans which the government may obtain, to finance the construction of specific hydro-electric power projects, and a fertilizer plant.\r\n4. A law providing for the redemption of:\r\n(a) Philippine National Bank notes legally issued and now outstanding, and providing for the registration of Philippine National Bank notes issued illegally by the enemy.\r\n(b) Emergency notes legally authorized by the Philippine Government at the beginning of the war; and\r\n(c) Duly authorized guerrilla currency in circulation at a fixed percentage or fixed value, not to exceed a total out- lay of P30,000,000.\r\n5. A law authorizing the President of the Philippines to obtain from the Central Bank funds for certain purposes specifically authorized by law when, in the opinion of the Bank, the existing exchange reserves are in excess of fore- seeable demands to cover the balance of payments of the nation.\r\n6. A law fixing the site of the Capitol and the offices of the National Government, authorizing the expropriation of\r\nprivate lands to be included in that site, and appropriating the necessary funds for the payment of the value of such lands, the development of the site and the construction of the buildings thereon.\r\n7. The enactment of the Civil Code prepared by the Code Commission.\r\n8. A law to authorize the Bureau of Lands to subdivide United States military reservations returned to the Philip- pine Government and to sell the same in small lots, giving priority to present bona fide occupants of such lands and to war veterans at prices approved by the President, except such portions as may be reserved by the President for the use of the national or local governments.\r\n9. A law amending Republic Act No.8 authorizing the Bureau of Lands, the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation or such other agencies of the government as the President may designate, to subdivide agricultural and residential lands formerly belonging to enemy nationals and which have been transferred to the Philippine Government, except such portions as the President may reserve for the use of the national or local governments, and to sell such lands in small lots at prices approved by the President, giving priority to veterans, including members of the USAFFE, recognized guerrillas, and unrecognized but deserving members of guerrilla organizations.\r\n10. A law appropriating the necessary funds for a new census.\r\n11. A law authorizing the creation of a public corporation to administer the international airport as well as the other commercial airfields throughout the Philippines belonging to the government.\r\n12. A law requiring insurance companies to invest at least fifty per cent of their reserves in loans, the proceeds of which will be used in the Philippines.\r\n13. A law amending the Administrative Code to grant more autonomy to, and enlarge the power of taxation of, provinces and municipalities.\r\n14. A law authorizing the. President under certain conditions to guarantee loans granted by certain international or foreign credit institutions to government or private banks, companies or private individuals.\r\n15. A law authorizing the government to guarantee a certain percentage of any loss which may be suffered by any private bank, insurance company or any other credit institution, on account of loans it may grant to private individuals for home construction, the amount of each loan not to exceed P10,000 for each individual borrower, and fixing the aggregate amount of the loans for which such guarantee may be given.\r\n16. A law amending the National Internal Revenue Code by providing for collection in advance of the sales tax on the basis of the declared cost of the merchandise withdrawal from the custom-house or factory; the amount collected in advance to be credited to the actual tax liability after the first sale has been made.\r\n17. A law amending the National Internal Revenue Code by increasing the present tax rates on alcoholic beverages, beer, soft drinks, cigarettes and other tobacco products.\r\n18. The approval of other measures implementing the recommendations of the Joint Financial Commission.\r\n19. A law lifting the moratorium subject to certain conditions.\r\n20. A law establishing a social security system for the benefit of wage earners and low-salaried employees.\r\nMy specific recommendations will be submitted when the actuarial studies bearing on this subject are completed. We cannot be too careful in estimating the burdens that any program of social security will entail on the employers and the taxpayers. We must proceed gradually and cautiously on this matter. On the other hand, we must not delay or spare any sacrifice or effort to safeguard the livelihood and security of the workingmen. The program under study is a modest beginning. It contemplates a plan for the payment in addition to existing benefits of P1,000 to the beneficiaries of a wage earner or low-salaried employee upon his death, and to grant to him 50 per cent of his salary for a period not exceeding three months, in case of illness or loss of employment not attributable to his fault or negligence. The system will apply to employees and laborers of the government as well as to those working in private enterprises.\r\nFrom time to time during this session and at the earliest possible date, I shall submit for your consideration other legislative proposals.\r\nI ask the Congress to give preferential attention to the creation of the Central Bank. This measure would strengthen our banking system and provide resiliency to our monetary system without in any way affecting its stability. With the reform contemplated in our monetary system, as a result of the creation of the Central Bank, I expect some funds will become available to finance our industrial program, the construction of irrigation systems and other aids to agriculture and industry which are urgently needed to accelerate the economic development of our nation.\r\nI also request your earliest consideration of the measure I have mentioned above appropriating the proceeds of loans we are now seeking to finance the construction of certain hydro-electric power projects. The approval of this measure is absolutely necessary before the loan we are now applying for could be granted.\r\nThe legislative measures I am recommending in this message cover many subjects. They are intended to meet our requirements in many fields. I am convinced that they will serve not only to consolidate the advances we have made but to pave the way for wider and further advances towards national reconstruction and development.\r\nAPPEAL FOR ACTION\r\nWe are still far away from our chosen goals. But we are decidedly on our way. I assure you we are treading on firm ground and marching in the right direction. We are following paths which the experience of nations has proven to be safe and reliable. We are attempting no shortcuts. We are developing our national economy in the hard but surest way. We must not allow ourselves to be distracted by the alluring promises of new and strange ideologies or the radical theories of neo-economists. We cannot afford to make mistakes. We would pay for them very dearly in tears and toil. If we should work together now as we did in the past, I assure you we shall move forward at a good pace without having to change our democratic ways, without renouncing the liberties that we cherish, ever closer to the high planes of prosperity, well- being, and social justice that we have always sought for our people.\r\nLet us not waste our energies in partisan conflict nor in any attempt to gain personal advantage while we are engaged in this all-consuming task of lifting our Republic from the ashes of war and insuring for our countrymen all the blessings of peace and happiness. What the future may have in store for you or for me is of no consequence. What will befall our people and the kind of heritage we leave to our children, and what we can do to make their lot a happy one, constitute the only problem that should absorb our thoughts and stir our hearts during these trying days which, I am sure, will also be days of triumph and glory for our Republic if we have the courage and the wisdom to meet the challenge of the times and to keep faith with the noble principles and traditions which have inspired and sustained us throughout the darkest period of our history. The stakes are too high and the risks are too great to allow ourselves to be swerved from our sworn duty to the nation. God help our people if we desert our trust!", "title": "The Nation on the Road to Prosperity"},
{"delivered": "1935-11-25 17:34:25+00:00", "author": "Manuel L. Quezon", "text": "[Delivered in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building on November 25, 1935\r\nMr. Speaker, gentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nAs I appear before you for the first time, allow me to extend to you my cordial greetings and congratulations upon your election to this august body. It is your unique privilege to serve our country at the most critical period of its existence\u2014at a time when the course of its destiny will be charted.\r\nThe framers of our Constitution conferred upon our Government all the power and authority needed to meet the demands of a progressive and enlightened epoch so that it may be able to promote the welfare and happiness of our people and safeguard their liberty.\r\nI know you are well aware of the share of responsibility in the task of government which belongs to you. Unlike the Legislature that preceded you, which had two Houses, this National Assembly is by itself the whole Legislative Department of the government. When you take final action on a measure, there is no other legislative branch that will pass upon and give it further consideration. The measure as you pass it goes directly to the Chief Executive, who is devoid of any power to alter it in any way and has no alternative except that of giving it his express or implied approval, or of vetoing it.\r\nIn my opinion, the main responsibility for legislative action is yours. It will be my policy as Chief Executive to give you, in every case, the benefit of doubt. You may, therefore, rest assured that, if ever, I shall exercise my veto power with reluctance, and only when I am strongly convinced that it is my plain and unavoidable duty to do so in the interest of the common weal.\r\nArticle VII, section 11, (5) of the Constitution directs the President to present to the National Assembly, from time to time, information on the state of the Nation, and to recommend to its consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\r\nIn the fulfillment of this duty, I am addressing the National Assembly today on the fundamental responsibility of a state\u2014on a question involving our very existence when we become a free member of the family of nations. This question is that of assuring the future safety of our beloved country.\r\nSelf-defense is the supreme right of mankind, no more sacred to the individual than to the nation, the interests of which are immeasurably of greater significance and extent. A threat against the nation involves not alone the life of one individual, but of millions; not the welfare and fortune of a single family, but of all. And above everything else, depending upon the exercise of the right of national self-defense is freedom itself, the most precious reward from Heaven to the worthy. This immutable principle is firmly incorporated in our Constitution\u2014the Magna Charta of Philippine Liberty.\r\nWe, the citizens of these Islands, are now fairly started upon the final stretch of the long road we have so patiently and persistently followed toward the goal of independence. Up to here the trail has been a tortuous one. But the difficulties we have encountered and the frustrations we have endured have not deterred us from our purpose. They have served only to spur us onward\u2014to increase the intensity of our undying devotion to the cause for which no cost could be too great, no sacrifice too bitter. And now at last, with success so plainly in our sight, our love of liberty and the voice of reason alike urge us to guard and cherish the prize that has been so hardly won.\r\nI would be recreant to my duty did I not come to you, in my first appearance before the National Assembly, to ask your ungrudging support for the establishment of a sound system of National Defense. This is our first and most urgent need.\r\nAs we commit ourselves to this important task we realize that a war-weary world groans under a burden of armaments. Every accretion to the accumulated total is invariably subjected to careful and even suspicious scrutiny. But the world must be well aware that in the present state of our development, the establishment within these Islands of an aggressive force capable of threatening the security of any other nation would be fantastic. Consequently, without fear that any act of ours may be misunderstood or resented by others, we are free to undertake every preparatory measure of defense that the circumstances of our situation may require.\r\nNevertheless, it is well that we now announce, through clear delineation of our objective, definite limits upon the efforts we shall make in this direction. That objective is a single one\u2014peace\u2014permanent peace! This objective is proclaimed in our own Constitution and no Filipino dares to challenge it. No purpose of our own, no conceivable temptation or manipulation from abroad, can ever lead us into war save in defense of our own rights, waged within the limits of our own territory. Our full desire is to insure domestic tranquillity and to guarantee to our citizens the opportunity to pursue, without external molestation, prosperity and happiness under a stable government, devised, developed, and maintained by the people themselves.\r\nIn furtherance of this purpose I shall submit to you a comprehensive plan for national defense. In my opinion the plan reflects the lessons of history, the conclusions of acknowledged masters of warfare and of statesmanship, and the sentiments and aspirations of the Filipino people. It is founded upon enduring principles that are fundamental to any plan applicable to our needs.\r\nThe first of these principles is that every citizen is obligated to the nation\u2019s defense. All the individual and national resources may be used by the State in the interest of self-preservation. No man has the inalienable right to enjoy the privileges and opportunities conferred upon him by free institutions unless he simultaneously acknowledges his duty to defend with his life and with his property the Government through which he acquires these opportunities and these privileges. To deny this individual responsibility is to reject the whole theory of democratic government.\r\nThis principle knows no limitation of time or condition. It is effective in war, in peace, and for as long as the nation shall endure. Impelled by cogent reasons I propose its specific application to our peace-time task of preparation, by requiring every citizen of suitable age and physique to undergo military training as an obligation to the State.\r\nThe ultimate bulwark of liberty is the readiness of free citizens to sacrifice themselves in defense of that boon. Where this spirit has been inculcated through generations and has become firmly embedded in the public consciousness, nations have been strong, virile, prosperous, and stable. Where citizens have grown neglectful of this individual obligation, especially where they have sought to deny its validity, the result has been decadence, weakness, poverty, and destruction.\r\nTo foster national pride and patriotism nothing is more effective than to participate actively in the processes of maintaining the national defense. Military training and service build up the spirit of duty and love of country. They nurture patriotism, loyalty, courage, and discipline. A nation of trained men ready to defend their country has the lasting respect of itself and of the world. A nation of helpless citizens can expect nothing but slavery at home, and contempt abroad. If we are wise, if we are mindful of the lessons history teaches, we will provide a military education for our entire manhood, beginning from early adolescence. To accomplish this purpose a utilization of the public-school system immediately suggests itself. By inculcating in rising generations the soldierly virtues, by preparing our people spiritually and physically to serve the state, our schools will be building upon solid foundations not only national consciousness and solidarity but also boldness of spirit which are indispensable to the free and uninterrupted development of this nation.\r\nThe second basic principle is that our national defense system must provide actual security. Indeed, an insufficient defense is almost a contradiction in terms. A dam that crumbles under the rising flood is nothing more than a desolate monument to the wasted effort and lack of vision of its builders. In this one function of government there can be no compromise with minimum requirements. Our program of national defense must serve notice upon the world that the citizens of these Islands are not to be subjugated; that conquest of this nation cannot be accomplished short of its utter destruction, and that that destruction would involve such staggering cost to an aggressor, both in blood and gold, that even the boldest and the strongest will unerringly mark the folly of such an undertaking.\r\nThe next principle to which I hold is the insistent need for current and future economy. Although there are no costs of peace comparable to those that would surely follow defeat in war, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the Government to avoid every unnecessary expenditure. During the three centuries of Philippine history as a dependency, there have been largely lifted from our shoulders the burdens incident to sovereignty, particularly those of providing for our own protection. These burdens our people now gladly accept. They stand ready to pay the cost, whatever it may be, of assuring the permanent security and integrity of the homeland. But for us in the Government, to permit this cost to exceed the minimum demanded by the purpose that we seek would be an inexcusable blunder and a betrayal of the trust reposed in us.\r\nThe need for minimizing expense not only requires the utmost efficiency in details, but also it clearly indicates the basic character of the defensive establishment we must devise. Specifically, it precludes, for the present at least, the development of a battle fleet. Naval strength is expressed principally in terms of fighting ships, each of which, even in the small and auxiliary categories, can be produced only at tremendous cost. It is manifestly impossible, in the current state of our economic development, to acquire a fleet that could offer even partially effective resistance to any existing navy worthy of the name.\r\nOne desirable effect of a decision to forego the construction of a battle fleet will be to emphasize the passively defensive character of our military establishment. Tactically, a fleet cannot operate as a purely defensive force and is useless unless it can proceed to see and engage its enemy beyond the limits of its own bases. Moreover, the existence of a powerful navy inherently implies a possibility of aggressive intent, since only with strong naval support could an army hope to invade the territory of an overseas enemy. Consequently, as an island nation, our lack of sea power will confirm before the world our earnest intent to develop an army solely for defensive purposes.\r\nAnother fundamental premise is the necessity for a gradual rather than sudden growth of the required defense establishment. Both economy and efficiency demand no immediate and complete organization of a force of the necessary eventual strength. A modern army is a complex organism, and its defensive power is not measured solely by the number of its soldiers. Suitable armament, proper organization, professional technique and skill, applicable tactical doctrine and, above all, trained leadership are the very soul of an army\u2019s combat efficiency. However lavish may be the expenditure, these things cannot be instantly acquired. They are brought about only through thoughtful, painstaking, and persistent effort, intelligently directed. Progress in these fields will determine the rate at which the whole development, including increases in personnel strength, may logically and efficiently proceed.\r\nNevertheless, it is imperative that our plans reach fruition by the time the beneficent protection of the United States shall have been finally withdrawn. We have ten years, and only ten, in which to initiate and complete the development of our defensive structure, the creation of which, because of the conditions of our past existence, must now begin at the very foundations. Not a moment is to be lost. Starting immediately, we must build economically and gradually, but steadily and surely, so as to attain within the time permitted us the highest possible efficiency at the lowest possible cost.\r\nFinally, I must emphasize the need for logical governmental procedure in this development\u2014a procedure calculated to minimize error and to avoid loss of time, waste of resources, and unnecessary exposure of the country to the risks of unpreparedness. Since our security arrangements must be carefully moulded to fit the special and particular needs of our country, there exists nowhere in the world a model upon which our own defenses may be blindly patterned. Step by step we must design a new organism, and in doing so we must advance progressively from the general to the specific; from the explored to the unexplored. A continuous adjustment of essential details to constantly evolving requirements will be mandatory. Such a procedure will be possible only through the exercise of administrative authority, taking advantage of the highest professional and technical advice. But since under our form of government, administrative authority is limited to the task of execution, it is highly important that initial legislation for the erection of the nation\u2019s defenses should confer upon the President as Commander-in-Chief, a very considerable latitude in carrying out the expressed purposes of the National Assembly. Any attempt, at the outset of this undertaking, to formulate a plan that would prescribe in concrete and inflexible language every detail of the complete development could not fail to result in added cost and slow progress.\r\nThe essential elements of our defensive system will in time become more clearly crystallized and definitely moulded to the needs of the nation. Then, it will be time for the National Assembly to enact legislation with such details as it may deem desirable.\r\nBut though details of design in the superstructure of defense should, at least for the present, be charged to the Chief Executive, the Assembly must retain the responsibility of assuring the soundness of its foundations. It is not only the prerogative but also the duty of the Legislative Department to evolve and to prescribe the broad policies that are to control progress in this critically important task. Likewise it is a function of the Legislative Body to bestow specific authorization and to provide the funds essential to the purpose it seeks. Supported by such authority and guided by these policies, the Chief Executive will be enabled to proceed confidently and expeditiously toward the accomplishment of the legislative intent.\r\nThe central feature of the defensive system I propose is a trained and organized force, normally engaged in the pursuits of peace, and ready for effective employment whenever the interests of the nation so demand. Service in this force is to be rendered as a patriotic obligation to the state. Upon reaching maturity, each able-bodied male citizen will automatically become liable for a period of intensive military training. From the number annually attaining this age, a training quota of the required size will be selected by lot. Moreover, so far as the capacity of the Army will permit, volunteers from among those not so selected, or from older age groups, will be incorporated into the training cadres. Upon completion of his training period, each citizen will return to civil life, but as a member of an Army reserve unit. Thus the burden of defense will be widely distributed, and each citizen will devote to exclusive military activity only an insignificant portion of his time.\r\nThe regular element of the Army, composed of volunteers from every geographical area of the Islands, will eventually attain a maximum strength of 1,500 officers and 19,000 enlisted men, including the existing Constabulary. Its officers and men will pursue the military profession as a life\u2019s career and devote themselves exclusively to the nation\u2019s defense. The Regular Army must become a model of efficiency\u2014the energizing element and, professionally, the directing head of the whole establishment. Its missions will comprehend the maintenance of permanent overhead for the entire force, including such essential services as procurement, storage, transportation, communication, and sanitation; the prosecution of research and experimentation to keep the Army abreast of latest developments in every branch of the military profession; and instruction of the reserve.\r\nIn organizational and operational outline the proposed system is the essence of simplicity. Under its provisions the Chief of Staff of the Army is selected by and is directly responsible to the President, and will have the rank of a Secretary of Department. Under him will be a Department of National Defense comprising the several staff sections required for general supervision of the whole military establishment and for the control of administration, training, maintenance, and other essential functions.\r\nThe reserve units will be dispersed through all the Islands, approximately according to population. The national territory will be divided into military districts and subdistricts, in each of which will be maintained a small professional cadre for the training of the annual quota locally called to the colors. Training periods except for trainees selected to serve with the Regular Force will normally extend over a period of five and a half months. Thereafter, for ten years, each trainee will be required to undergo annually sufficient training to preserve individual and collective efficiency. From that time onward his training will grow progressively less.\r\nUnder this system we will have, within ten years, hundreds of thousands of trained individuals, and eventually practically the entire male population will have had military training. The younger men of this group will be constantly organized into tactical formations. Supporting these units will be a pool of trained individuals, generally in higher age groups, but available in emergency for replacements in line organizations or for employment in staff services. Equipment and supplies for reserve organizations will be locally stored and maintained, under the control of professionally trained cadres.\r\nSupplementing the training given in the Army will be the military instructional system in schools and colleges. Every educational institution wholly or partially supported at public expense is to serve, under the plan, as an agency for inculcating patriotism and for assisting in the important work of instructing our people in the essentials of the military profession. Starting with students, aged ten, intensive courses in citizenship, sanitation, and physical development will be progressively widened in scope during the period of adolescence, until at the age of eighteen, every able-bodied male student will have pursued a thorough course in elementary military practices and methods. As a consequence, even though quotas annually trained in the Army will comprise only a portion of the young men attaining the age of twenty-one, we will eventually acquaint our entire male population with the essential requirements of military service.\r\nThe plan provides a comprehensive system for the emergency mobilization of the reserves so as to insure rapid, concerted, and efficient action in the face of emergency. It proposes yearly objectives in the procurement of armaments and equipment. All these things and many others, I have developed in as exhaustive detail as is now possible, to the end that my proposals to the National Assembly might comprise concrete rather than theoretical recommendations.\r\nAlthough, in broad outline, the proposed system of defense may be thus briefly and accurately described, the governmental problems involved in transforming plans into actual accomplishment will be almost baffling in their intricacy and difficulty. Preliminary to undertaking actual development, necessary laws must be formulated and approved, and initial selections of higher military officials accomplished. Thereafter, and in full accord with the provisions of these legislative enactments, the professional and technical phases of the task will begin. Merely to name the more important of them is to indicate clearly the involved character of the project.\r\nOrganization of the Department of National Defense must aim at efficient functioning, but must avoid extravagance entailed by the maintenance of unnecessary overhead. Its membership must possess the qualifications required by the purpose of each essential bureau, including those, for example, pertaining to armament, administration, supply, sanitation, and legal affairs.\r\nAn efficient officer corps is the very soul of an army. To produce one of the requisite size and qualifications we must first provide for its gradual accumulation, so that future turn-over will involve only a small annual increment. We must evolve policies governing appointments, promotion, pay, assignment, and retirements, and must provide for the thorough military education of its members. Technical schools must be established, and for these the faculties must first be organized and thoroughly indoctrinated.\r\nSuitable tactical organization of the Army, accurately adjusted to the necessities of Philippine conditions, must be developed. Applicable doctrine and method must be evolved. A skeletonized organization for registration of citizens subject to military training, and for receiving, caring for and training annual quotas must be established. Necessary programs pertaining to munitions, including such technical items as airplanes, rifles, cannon, machine guns, ammunition, signal equipment, bridging material, and a host of other matters must be formulated in accordance with our minimum needs. Inspection, accounting, and other phases of administration must be established and maintained. All these constitute immediate problems for which solutions must develop side by side, each fully articulated and synchronized with all others.\r\nThis necessary control, direction, and coordination of a myriad of essential details represents one of the most difficult and critical problems of the entire project. In its importance to progress, it will, for some years to come, overshadow all others. For its successful solution there is immediately demanded, not only a technical ability that extends to every phase of the military profession, but also a broad and thorough experience in the field of higher administration, organization, and leadership. Unless these qualifications can be made constantly available to the Commonwealth we will pay for their lack in millions of squandered pesos, years of wasted time, and in confusion of effort and added risks to our nation\u2019s security.\r\nUnfortunately it is this type of ability and experience that, as yet, there has been little opportunity to develop among our own people. We have produced, both in the Constabulary and in the Philippine Scouts, officers of outstanding worth in particular lines of military endeavor, from among whom we confidently expect to obtain initially the senior officers of the new Army. But due to the conditions of our past existence we have had no War Department, no complete defense force, no balanced army, no exclusive responsibility for protection, and, consequently, no experience in the functions that now assume for us a transcendent importance.\r\nIn this situation we have no alternative but to obtain this experience, this ability, and this skill from other sources, and in my anxiety on this score I earnestly considered all upon which we might logically depend.\r\nEvery consideration of friendship and association supported the hope that this source might be the United States. Consequently, I presented to the President of that country the essentials of this problem and explained our dire need for help. More specifically I earnestly requested the detail of General Douglas MacArthur, then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, as the one soldier whose opinion on every question of military organization would command the respect of all our people. The President\u2019s response was immediate, sympathetic, and definite.\r\nAt a very real sacrifice to the American Army this officer, who since 1930 had served continuously as its Chief of Staff, has been made available to the Commonwealth Government as Military Adviser. His record in peace and war requires no eulogy from me. His qualifications for the important post in which he will serve are as clearly appreciated among our own people as they are in Washington. Because of this, and because also of his own known devotion to the Philippines and to the Filipino people, the wisdom of his choice will be universally recognized. I request authority to confer upon General MacArthur and his assistants the rank and emoluments that I deem in keeping with their important duties and the dignity of this nation.\r\nThe several provisions of law fundamental to the development of Philippine defense are outlined in a draft of a bill which I shall presently furnish you. It depicts, in much greater detail than I have attempted here, the defense plan I propose for adoption. It represents the essence of the authorizations, directives, and general policies necessary to insure initiation of the project.\r\nAgain, I emphasize the need for prompt and positive action in initiating this great project. In every other line of human endeavor we have built, not only the foundations, but also the framework and, in certain cases, even the edifice itself. But here, except for necessary law enforcement elements, not a stone has been laid.\r\nThe refusal to grant us immediate and complete independence has been due, in large measure, to our present inability to cope with a general revolt or to offer any kind of resistance to an invading force. Your swift action on the defense measures I am proposing will prove the earnestness of our determination to be, and forever to remain, free and independent. What, I ask, would be the use of seeing our country free one day, with its own flag standing alone and flying against the sky, only to see ourselves the subjects of another power the following day, with its flag the sovereign in and of our country? What would be the purpose of educating our young men and women concerning their rights and privileges as free citizens, if tomorrow they are to be subjects of a foreign foe? Why build up the wealth of the Nation only to swell up the coffers of another? If that be our preordained fate, why seek a new master when the Stars and Stripes has given us not only justice and fair treatment, welfare and prosperity, but also ever increasing political liberties including independence?\r\nNational freedom now stands before us as a shining light\u2014the freedom that for many years gleamed only fitful candle in the distant dark. We shall make ourselves ready to grasp the torch, so that no predatory force may ever strike it from our hands!", "title": "Message to the First Assembly on National Defense"},

Garcia on His First State of the Nation Address", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 27, 1958]\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nIn the exercise of their sovereign prerogatives, our people have entrusted to us the responsibility of administering the affairs of the nation. As Congress\r\nopens today the legislative phase of our joint trusteeship, I have come to counsel with you in accordance with the Constitution\u2019s mandate. I am confident\r\nthat, guided by the Infinite Wisdom, we shall prove equal to the people\u2019s expectations, and live up to our solemn commitments to them.\r\nFortunately, we have succeeded to an administration that was also our own because most of us were part of it and because, under the concept of party\r\nresponsibility, its policies were formulated and implemented by us. Consequently, we have to continue these policies; with some addition, we must continue\r\nbuilding up the nation, spurred by the dynamics of progressive national growth.\r\nThe Administration before us suffered a rude interruption with the tragic death of my illustrious predecessor, Ramon Magsaysay. His loss is irreparable.\r\nThe Philippines and the rest of the free world sorely miss him. We, however, find consolation in the fact that his spirit abides with us to inspire us to\r\nnew heights of achievement.\r\nYou are all aware that I assumed the presidency in the wake of a shocking national tragedy and at a time of intense political activity, leading to the\r\nNovember elections. Accepting the will of the Divine Providence and the mandate of the Constitution, I occupied the office of President for nine and\r\none-half months to complete the term of the late Chief Executive and carry on his work to the best of my ability and capacity.\r\nI shall therefore, endeavour to report to Congress the state of the nation as I found it at the end of the Magsaysay term, covering achievements of four\r\nyears since 1954. Having done this, I shall indicate the pressing problems facing the Republic and recommend to you what I believe to be their solutions.\r\nDuring the last four years of Nacionalista Administration, the climate of distrust approaching despair that had pervaded the nation was replaced by a\r\nreceiving faith in the Government and a growing confidence in the future of the Republic. The masses of our people came to enjoy the fruits of a determined\r\neffort to improve their lot. Our people were reaping the benefits of schools and sanitation, expanded irrigation systems, increased credit facilities, and\r\nimproved transportation. Our businessmen and industrialists were reacting with understanding to the coordinated efforts to promote the general economic\r\ndevelopment. The entire nation faced the future with increasing hope and confidence.\r\nIn completing the term of my predecessor, I had the advantage of the tremendous momentum he had generated in the promotion of the common welfare. During\r\n1954-1957, unprecedented advances were made in almost all sectors of national progress. I myself did not hesitate to take new measures and introduce new\r\npolicies whenever they were advisable and necessary. Such measures and policies were intended to check untoward developments mainly caused by the forces of\r\nnature or by international events beyond our control and also by our own transgressions against the eternal verities and the laws of measure and\r\nproportion.\r\nNational security is anchored on our own internal strength as well as on our cooperation with the United Nations, buttressed by regional arrangements like\r\nthe SEATO and by our special alliance of mutual defense with the United States.\r\n\u2014 While we have promoted our diplomatic and trade relations with countries in Europe and Asia, we have continued to strengthen our special relations with\r\nthe United States. Although there have been disagreements on some of the provisions governing military bases, Philippine-American relations have remained\r\nas close and harmonious as ever.\r\n\u2014 We have expanded our consular and diplomatic facilities and services abroad. We have sent an ambassador to the Vatican and have set up a legation in\r\nCairo, Egypt. We have raised our legations in Karachi, Pakistan; New Delhi, India; Seoul, Korea; and Saigon, South Vietnam, to the status of the embassies.\r\nWe have also opened honorary consulates in 13 key trade centers of the world. Our participations in the United Nations, the SEATO, and other world and\r\nregional conferences have raised our international stature and prestige.\r\nWe have concluded trade protocols with Germany, Switzerland, Nationalist China, and Japan, and have added trade and press attaches to a number of our\r\nembassy, legation, and consular staffs. The trade protocol with Germany includes provisions for the training of Filipino scholars and technicians in German\r\nindustrial and educational institutions. A major study is being undertaken on the proposals to expand our foreign trade not only to establish new financial\r\ncontacts but also to set up working balances abroad in other stable and freely convertible currencies. In due time the result of this study will be\r\nsubmitted for your consideration.\r\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines under the late President Magsaysay broke the back of the communist movement and paved the way for the outlawing of\r\ncommunism in our country. The almost total liquidation of the Huk rebellion forced a change of tactics and adequate measures were taken to meet the new\r\nsituation. The CAFA recommendation for the outlawing of the Communist Party and amendments to make the law on treason applicable in peace time were\r\nindorsed by the late Chief Executive, subsequently passed by Congress, and finally signed into law by me.\r\nNational security has two supports\u2014diplomacy on one hand and the Armed Forces on the other. The two are interrelated phases of national policy. Our Armed\r\nForces has a two-fold mission \u2014 the safeguarding of national security and the maintenance of peace and order, including assistance to the\r\nAdministration\u2019s socio-economic and rural development efforts.\r\nIn the first mission, our Armed Forces participated in several manoeuvres, conferences, and seminars under the auspices of SEATO. With American assistance,\r\nin accordance with our mutual defense alliance, and within the limits of our resources, we are beginning to streamline our military equipment and\r\norganization in conformity with the expected new requirements of warfare in this atomic-missile age.\r\nIn the second mission, aside from taking all necessary measures for the protection of life and property, our Armed Forces has conducted psychological\r\ncampaigns against dissident elements, helped in the large-scale resettlement of former outlaws, and assisted in the manufacture and installation of\r\nprefabricated schoolhouses where needed.\r\n\u2014 As a dynamic answer to Communism and a positive boost to economic progress, the Administration launched a greatly expanded and bold program of social and\r\neconomic development aimed at rural amelioration and at advancing industrial and agricultural productivity. The Rural Development program included land\r\nreforms, land resettlement, the establishment of the Court of Agrarian Relations and the Land Tenure Administration, the organization of cooperatives, the\r\nextension of credit, the setting up of expanded rural health units, the construction of roads, irrigation systems and artesian wells, the extension of\r\neducational facilities, and the encouragement of enlightened labor unionism.\r\n\u2014 In the implementation of our established policy of giving land to the landless, the Government issued during the last four years more than 162,219\r\npatents as compared to only 25,440 during the administration that ended December 30, 1953. The survey and subdivision of new land for distribution is also\r\nbeing hastened, and I propose the adoption of photogrammetry to further expedite survey requisite to the issuance of land titles. The policy launched in\r\n1954 by President Magsaysay of distributing six-hectare farms to those willing to pioneer has resulted in the settlement of 21,587 families in 18\r\nsettlement projects, mainly in Mindanao. The Land Tenure Administration\u2019s target is to purchase and distribute 105,000 hectares of land to 17,500 families\r\nyearly.\r\n\u2014 Government institutions like the RFC, the PNB, and the ACCFA expanded the area of their operations to rural areas, thus channelling the savings of the\r\neconomy to rural production. Complementarily, private banks increased not only their respective volumes of business but also their numbers and branches.\r\nFollowing a liberal policy from 1954 to late 1957, the banking system expanded credit to both the public and the private sectors by P1,209 million.\r\n\u2014 To further accelerate development at the grassroots level, the rural banking movement was intensified during the past four years. We now have 102 banking\r\ninstitutions well distributed over the country. We are considering the demand to enlarge the lending capacity of rural banks through the assistance of\r\ngovernment banks or financial institutions.\r\n\u2014 For the benefit of our rural masses, we have since 1954 organized 271,000 farmers into 467 cooperative marketing associations. In 1957 alone 51 FACOMAS\r\nwith a combined capital of P2.6 million were formed, bringing up the total of FACOMA membership to more than 26,000 farmers. This growth has enabled the\r\nACCFA to extend loans amounting to P142 million to 55,000 farmers for increased production enabled 65,000 farmers to acquire work animals and 15,000 others\r\nto purchase farm equipment. During 1957, the ACCFA also financed the purchase of P30 million worth of fertilizer and invested P1.5 million in the\r\ndevelopment of the ramie program.\r\nTo achieve a more efficient distribution of goods, especially the products of our farms, as well as to facilitate travel among our people, we have expanded\r\nour net work of roads.\r\nWe have also improved the Manila Railroad by converting it into diesel resulting in reduced operational cost.\r\n\u2014 During the last four years, around 3,940 kilometers of roads and 295 permanent bridges were constructed. Twenty-four national irrigation systems\r\nservicing 115,251 hectares and 27 communal irrigation projects servicing 57,410 hectares were constructed. Also installed and drilled were 31 irrigation\r\nunits consisting of pumps and servicing 196,805 hectares and 8,408 artesian wells i addition to 121 waterworks systems. Under construction are 98\r\nirrigation projects to water 198,893 hectares. All these projects, completed and under construction, will bring the total irrigated area to 568,359\r\nhectares. This figure represents about six times that irrigated by the systems constructed from 1907 to 1953.\r\n\u2014 Rural health was considerably fostered through the organization of health units, each manned by a physician, a nurse, a midwife, and a sanitary\r\ninspector. As of today, there are 1281 health units servicing 1300 municipalities in the country. The death rate is definitely declining. Infant mortality\r\nalone decreased from 98 to 84 per thousand. It should be stated that the organization of rural health units has the active assistance of the International\r\nCooperation Administration of the United States (ICA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the UNICEF.\r\nIn the long-range program of health improvement, the total eradication of malaria continues to be the objective. In cooperation with health and hospital\r\nagencies, our blood plasma dehydration laboratories have started an interisland blood collecting program. Under Republic Act. No. 1136, BCG immunization\r\nhas resulted in the tuberculine testing of 8 million children and the vaccination of 3 \u00bd million. Our pilot influenza virus preparatory to its approval by\r\nthe World Health Organization of the Western Pacific regional center.\r\n\u2014 Through the Social Welfare Administration the Government during the past four years has aided 1 \u00bd million persons. In 1957 alone 599,568 persons were\r\nextended relief by this government agency. It also resettled 1125 families from the slum areas of Manila. With the expansion of its regional offices, the\r\nSocial Welfare Administration was able, in the same year, to extend aid to 6400 families belonging to non-Christian or cultural minority groups. The\r\nprogram of vocational rehabilitation for the blind and other physically handicapped person has also been greatly expanded. A total of 1240 disabled has\r\nbeen given a thorough readjustment training to convert them into active and useful citizens. Forty-seven per cent of these people have already been\r\nabsorbed in industries.\r\n\u2014 No less significant are the strides made in public education. As a measure of insuring effective instruction, the full-day primary school session, which\r\nwe had before the implementation of Commonwealth Act 586, has been restores and the maximum size of classes has been reduced from 60 to 40 pupils. The\r\nvernacular is now being used as a medium of instruction in the first two years of the primary grades, thereby promoting optimum literacy, especially among\r\nthose pupils who can stay in school for only a few years.\r\nThe secondary curriculum has been revised so as to provide a common program of studies for the first two years, after which the student is given the\r\noption, with the help of a competent counsellor, to choose between a vocational course and a college preparatory course. In the revised curriculum more\r\nscience and mathematics are offered, in view of their importance in present-day life and world progress.\r\nThe community school, which has been developed after years of careful experimentation, has become the pattern for our country, particularly in the rural\r\nareas. Because of the improvement that this type of school has effected in the living conditions of the people in the community, it has elicited favorable\r\ncomments from foreign educators who have observed how it works.\r\nIn line with the economic development program of the Administration, vocational education has been receiving in\u00adcreased emphasis. Home industries are being\r\nfostered as a means of enabling our people to have a supplementary source of income. All school divisions have organized home industry centers which survey\r\nlocal raw materials to be developed, train workers, standardize products, and assist producers in marketing them.\r\n\u2014 The Administration of Justice has been speeded up since 1954, resulting in a greater pop\u00adular confidence in our courts. Our justice of the peace courts\r\ndisposed of 80,000 out of 90,000 cases filed, while our courts of first instance settled 40,000 out of 42,000 cases. The Court of Industrial Relations\r\ndecided 612 out of 758 cases filed before it, bringing its total of settled cases since 1954 to 8,576. The Agricultural Tenancy Commission also amicably\r\narbitrated 2,800 cases out of 3,200 submitted. The Court of Agrarian Relations disposed of 3,000 out of 5,400 cases; the Court of Tax Appeals decided 93\r\nout of 114 cases handled; while the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, during only six months of operation, disposed of 3,200 out of 7,000 cases.\r\nThe announced objective of establishing the highest pos\u00adsible morality in the Government is slowly being realized, with the Presidential Complaints and\r\nAction Committee, the Department of Justice, and other agencies working hand .in hand to minimize graft and corruption in public service. To attain a\r\nhigher level of morality and efficiency in public service, a thorough study was undertaken by the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission and its\r\nrecom\u00admendations which were enacted by Congress are well in the process of implementation.\r\nThe last Nacionalista Administration was committed to a program of economic development designed to accelerate the transition of our trade-oriented economy\r\nto an agro-industrial type. Emphasis was given to the building of the industrial strength which would produce an increasingly large proportion of our\r\nessential consumer needs. To coordinate government planning, the National Economic Coun\u00adcil was revitalized and a long-range and integrated economic plan\r\nbacked by a fiscal program was formulated. Last year, Congress was requested to create a National Development Authority to carry out economic policies,\r\nplans, and programs approved by the NEC and the President. Unfortunately the powers provided by the bill creating such a body were not sufficiently broad\r\nand flexible for the vast mission it is intended to accomplish that I constrained to veto it.\r\n\u2014 Towards the achievement of our economic goal, power development was stepped up; ramie, pig-iron smelting and steel plants were started; and overhead\r\nprojects such as highways, communications, and other facilities which support direct productive processes and trigger private enterprises were expanded.\r\nThe em\u00adphasis on economic development was evident in the rise of the total government expenditure for this purpose, from P151 million in the fiscal year\r\n1953 to P456 million in the fiscal year 1956, and to P506 million in the fiscal year 1957. Fiscal policy was deliberately employed as an instrument of\r\necono\u00admic development by allocating the highest possible propor\u00adtion of our available financial resources to this purpose. I wish to call your attention to\r\nthe fact that while the admin\u00adistration before 1954 used borrowed money for both budget\u00adary and economic development purposes, our administration borrowed\r\nonly for economic development.\r\n\u2014 1953-1957 the development of hydroelectric power gained momentum. The Binga hydroelectric plant which will be in full operation in 1960, the Ambuklao\r\nhydroelectric project, and Unit No. 2 of the Maria Cristina hydroelectric project, being built at a total cost of P225 million will supply a total of\r\n225,000 kilowatts of electric power. Likewise finished are the hydroelectric projects in Digos and Talomo, Davao; in Loboc, Bohol; in Penaranda, Nueva\r\nEcija; in Amburayan, La Union; in Balombon, Catanduanes; in Lake Buhi-Barit, Camarines Sur; and in Camp Philips, Agusan, Bukidnon, supplying a total of\r\n30.300 kilowatts.\r\n\u2014 Complementary to the increase in hydroelectric power capacity, various indus\u00adtrial projects were undertaken or authorized. These includ\u00aded the\r\nrehabilitation and modernization of the Naga Cement Plant and the completion and operation of the Iligan Steel Mills producing merchant steel bars. Already\r\nauthorized is the construction of another unit of the Maria Cristina Fertilizer Plant costing P15 million and estimated to double its present fertilizer\r\nproduction. Establishment of a pig-iron smelting plant in Iligan, Lanao; in Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, and in Angat, Bulacan, costing P50 million to\r\nbe financed from loans is under way in order to furnish the country with an integrated steel industry and to enable us to process our own iron ores instead\r\nof exporting them as such ores.\r\n\u2014 In fulfilment of the gov\u00adernmental policy of giving way to private capital whenever feasible and practicable, the Bacnotan Cement Plant of the CEPOC in\r\nLa Union was sold to a private group at very reasonable terms. In the same manner, the Government\u2019s shares in the Campania de Cellulosa de Filipinas were\r\nsold. Under this policy, the Government has offered for sale its participation in the Philippine Electrical Manufacturing Company and in the Manila Gas\r\nCorporation. It has also announced the outright sale of the Romblon Marble Project and the Pulp and Paper Mill. Proceeds from such sales would enable the\r\ngovernment to pioneer and invest in areas where private capital hesitates to venture. Thus, the gov\u00adernment is in business only to pioneer and pave the way\r\nfor private enterprise ultimately to take over.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Channelling of American aid to the private industrial sector is being encouraged through the Industrial Development Center which, out\u00adside of offering\r\ntraining courses and equipment demon\u00adstrations, has given dollar allocations totalling P33.7 million to 185 firms, long-term loans of P26 million to 46\r\nfirms, and guarantee-assistance on loans amounting to P9.5 mil\u00adlion to 56 others, including Pi million for livestock develop\u00adment.\r\nReparations \u2014 Pending the organization of the Reparations Commission now in process, the bulk of the first two years of Japanese reparations goods and\r\nservices has been ear\u00admarked for Government offices and corporations, but start\u00ading with the second year schedule, a procurement program for the private\r\nsector has been put into effect which will furnish canning plants, fishing boats, ocean-going vessels, pulp and paper plants, machineries for cottage\r\nindustries, and similar equipment for much needed industries. As of November, 1957, contracts for a total of P88.8 million worth of reparations items have\r\nbeen concluded.\r\n\u2014 The strong showing of the economy\u2019s productive sector from 1954 to 1957, underlined the general efficacy of the policies and measures implemented by our\r\nAdministration. Our national income increased at a steady rate from P7 billion in 1953 to P8.3 billion at the end of 1956, a gain of 18.6 per cent. All\r\nimportant sectors of the economy have advanced in this respect: agricultural income rose from P3 billion to P3.3 billion; mining, from only P107 million to\r\nP141 million; and manufacturing, from P834 million to P1.2 billion, registering a spectacular surge.\r\nThere has been no let-up in the steady development of our agriculture. The country\u2019s cultivated area increased from 6 million hectares in 1953 to 7 million\r\nin 1957. Of this area, 5.5 million hectares are devoted to food crops and 1.6 million hectares to commercial crops. It is estimated that agriculture\r\ncontributed about P3.5 billion or 40 per cent of the national income.\r\nThe greater flow today of income from construction, trade, transportation, and communications activity is added testi\u00admony that we have travelled a long\r\nand vigorous way from the ruins of war. It is not surprising then that a recent United Nations report has described the Philippines as having the highest\r\nrecord of production in this part of the world during the past ten years.\r\nPer Capita Income \u2014 Population has increased by approx\u00adimately 6 per cent since 1953, from 21.2 million to our 22.5 million. Yet in spite of the fact that\r\nwe have 1.3 million more people today than in 1953, the average annual per capita income has gone up from P322 to P361, showing a 12 per cent improvement.\r\nVolume of Physical Production \u2014 During the past four years we have seen the total domestic goods and services increased by 17.4 per cent. This\r\ndevelopment has been due to the phenomenal expansion of 47 per cent in manufacturing, 25 per cent in agriculture, and 13 per cent in mining. We have also\r\nwitnessed the establishment or 533 \u201cnew and necessary\u201d industries out of 830 granted tax-exemption privileges by the government under Republic Act No. 901.\r\nNon-agricul\u00adtural employment in 1289 establishments in the country has risen by 14.5 per cent during this period of expansion. Since 1954, more than 5586\r\nmanufacturing concerns have been established, many of which are producing commodities which we had to import in the past.\r\nIn spite of the substantial gain shown by the economy during the last four years, the country still has to increase production with greater diversity at a\r\npace faster than the rapid population growth Increased production for increased export and increased volume of domestic trade is the key to the solution of\r\nour problems of unemployment and unfavorable balance of payments.\r\nThe fact that the Philippines is still far from producing all the needs of the country underscores the continuing im\u00adportance of foreign trade to our\r\neconomy. There are certain consumer goods which we cannot now produce or hope to produce in the near future, but are nevertheless basic to maintain\r\nstandards of living and public health. Among these are medicine and certain essential foodstuffs. We also have to import an increasing volume of machinery\r\nand raw materials required by our growing domestic industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014 With their gradual removal al\u00adready envisioned, exchange and import controls with all their attendant administrative difficulties continued to be a\r\nnecessary part of the economic life during the last four years. Our aggregate capacity for external payments was inadequate to finance our increasing\r\nimport requirements and servicing of foreign capital. Although the trade rela\u00adtions with the United States were somewhat improved by the Laurel-Langley\r\nAgreement, the trade imbalance per\u00adsisted, partly owing to the loopholes in the controls and partly to the additional import demands generated by our\r\ndeveloping industries. From 1954 to 1957 our foreign ex\u00adchange earnings reached the record total of $1.7 billion. However, our import payments amounted to\r\n$2.3 billion. The trade deficit of $600 million had to be paid from the dollar reserves. Aside from the vulnerability to wide fluc\u00adtuations in world prices\r\nand the demand inherent in the raw material nature of our exports, the sale of our export prod\u00aducts has been limited by trade restrictions in industrial\r\ncountries and their discovery of cheaper substitutes.\r\nFurther affecting our foreign exchange receipts was the undue use of barter under Republic Act No. 1410. This diverted a considerable part of our dollar\r\nearnings into hoarded deposits abroad. It also facilitated additional non-essential imports and contributed to our failure to fill our sugar quota to the\r\nUnited States in 1957. Thus, the re-examination of Republic Act No. 1410 recommends itself to the attention of Congress. For the same reasons, I vetoed\r\nSenate Bill No. 167, known as the Dollar Retention law, and suspended temporarily the processing of barter applications.\r\nThat we have succeeded to a certain extent in the judi\u00adcious use of our international reserve to secure benefits to the economy is evident from. the\r\nspecific economic gains pre\u00adviously cited and the steady change in the pattern of our imports since 1949, when the government undertook to manage the\r\ncountry\u2019s foreign exchange resources directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf our total import disburse\u00adment from 1954 to November, 1957, $0.4 billion went for the purchase of capital goods with which we are building the base of\r\nour industries, $1.2 billion for raw materials to feed our growing number of factories, and $0.5 billion for consumer goods to maintain the well-being and\r\nliving standards of our people. We also find that Philippine trade has diversified considerably since 1954. In that year almost 64 per cent of our total\r\ntrade was carried with one country, the United States. Today, with our total trade expanded from P1.8 billion in 1954 to P1.9 billion, we have channelled\r\n42 per cent of it to Europe, Asia, and Central and South Amer\u00adica. This geographical broadening of our trade is an en\u00adcouraging feign of growing stability\r\nand lessened dependence on a single country us the source of our imports and the market for our exports.\r\nThere was considerable improvement in labor-manage\u00adment relations. Last year, 135 collective bargaining con\u00adtracts were concluded. During the same period,\r\n412 labor unions were accredited, bringing the total to 2676 since 1954. Eight regional offices, in addition to those in Manila, were set up in strategic\r\npoints throughout the country to serve the nine million Filipino workers. Of the 57 strikes dec\u00adlared during the past year, 50 were satisfactorily settled\r\nthrough conciliation. Under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, P8 million were paid to labor. Matching its acquisition of a widening range of improvements and\r\nbenefits, labor is developing a deeper sense of responsibility which is helpful to industrial peace.\r\nWhile the objective of affording our government employ\u00adees more time for leisure and self-improvement through the enactment of the five-day law is\r\nlaudable, its implementa\u00adtion has created certain problems in various government units. We should, therefore, give serious study to these problems, as they\r\nwould affect the adoption of a general policy in this regard.\r\nWith respect to unemployment, our program of economic development will precisely produce increased job opportuni\u00adties. While we believe that we are in some\r\nmeasure taking care of the annual additions to the employable labor force the backlog of unemployment is expected to be absorbed by the accelerated pace of\r\nour industries as well as their logical expansion consistent with our resources.\r\n\u2014 The Magsaysay Administration fully real\u00adized that the problem of mobilizing the resources necessary to implement the policy of accelerated development\r\nwould be a difficult and complex task. It was, nevertheless, a task that had to be done if the country was to attain an economic independence compatible\r\nwith its political sovereignty. Accordingly, the Administration boldly resorted to the liberal use of national credit to cover the inevitable gap inherent\r\nin our underdeveloped country, between the growth of needed investment and voluntary savings. The only other alternative would have been to cut our\r\nessential develop\u00adment investment to a point where the budget would be balanced with no risk of inflation but at which economic forces would be at a\r\nstandstill.\r\nThe aroused desires of our masses for improving their lot and the threat of communism left no choice to the Administration but to take the calculated risk\r\ninherent in the generous use of national credit for financing economic development. The risk that the program might generate inflationary pressures was\r\ntaken after a careful appraisal of the situation and with the firm determination on the part of the Administration to retrench in its budgets and adopt\r\nsafeguards whenever pressures would develop that would produce adverse effects on the economy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the envisioned conditions in the accepted program of development failed to materialize within the estimated time. Many of the proposed tax\r\nmeasures failed to get congressional approval while outlays for essential government services increased in response to the demands of a growing population,\r\nthus aggravating the inflationary pressures generated by the development spending. On the other hand, the private sector responded enthusiastically to the\r\nimpulse policies of the development program which included tax incentives, subsidies, protection, and easy credit. As a result, private investment expanded\r\nat a rate beyond what was allocated in the budget of real resources. Most of the investment was at the same time diverted to capital intensive projects\r\nthat required substantial amounts of foreign exchange. Likewise, the foreign exchange receipts of the country were undermined by overshipments, overpricing\r\nof imports and underpricing of exports, smuggling, and other practices to circumvent controls.\r\nUpsetting further the forecasted monetary implications of the program were the continued inflationary pressures abroad, the Suez crisis, the rise in\r\nfreight charges, all of which were reflected in a rise of prices of industrial and consumer goods that the country buys from foreign countries. As a\r\nresult, the heavy spending for development of both the private and the public sectors exceeded the country\u2019s ability to produce and its capacity to export.\r\nThe Administration\u2019s program of development could not thus but unleash inflationary pressures; so the major task of the Administration was the prevention\r\nof such pressures from jeopardizing the development efforts and the living standards of the masses. Despite the inflationary effects of the program,\r\nhowever, domestic prices were kept at reasonable levels considered tolerable for a growing eco\u00adnomy, by drawing on our international- reserve. In 1949,\r\nwhen exchange control was established, the consumer price index, with 1955 as base, was 101.6. By 1956, the index had settled at 102.7 after slipping down\r\nfrom the 1952 peak of 106.1 points.\r\n\r\nWithout resorting to substantial foreign assistance, we achieved our economic progress at some sacrifice of our international reserve. The question of why\r\nthe country\u2019s international reserve has con\u00adtinued to decline in spite of controls finds an answer in our committed policy of development within a\r\nframework of monetary stability. The reserve has not been dissipated as the pattern of importation clearly demonstrates. It has been increasingly put to\r\nuse to purchase the machinery and the tools of our industrialization without which no satis\u00adfactory solution to the problems of poverty and unemploy\u00adment\r\nwould ever be possible. In addition to the increased requirements of our growing industries, we dipped into our reserve for the expanding needs of our\r\ngrowing population for imported essential consumer goods. However, we can\u00adnot continue to draw on our dwindling reserve indefinitely at the present pace\r\nwithout undermining the international value of the peso and completely setting back our develop\u00adment program completely set at its crucial stages.\r\nAs we reached this limit, in drawing on our international reserve as the inflationary effects of the heavy spending for development became correspondingly\r\ngreater on the domes\u00adtic economy as indicated by recent spiraling of prices. No one in this country considers inflation compatible in our democratic\r\nsystem. Aside from its manifest social in\u00adjustices, it creates social unrest. The Government and our citizenry are determined to insure economic and\r\nmonetary stability even if this means a temporary retrenchment in our program.\r\nThus far, I have presented to you a picture of our country that glows with the record of our growth and achievements. It is something of which we can\r\njustly be proud. But it would not be realistic and true to life if I did not point out its dark side. Life after all is a blend of sunlight and shadows, of\r\nsuccesses and failures, of joys and sorrows. We do have problems and serious ones that challenge the best in us to solve them. Self-denial and even some\r\nsacri\u00adfices may be needed. We have the problems of food in\u00adsufficiency, unemployment, rising prices, dwindling inter\u00adnational reserve, decreasing revenue\r\ncollections, increasing budgetary requirements, and other problems of equal importance and urgency. But with faith and courage we will meet these problems\r\nand solve them to the satisfaction of our people.\r\nEconomic problems are not solved in a day, and foreign assistance does not immediately jump at the beck of oppor\u00adtunity. We must, therefore, face the fact\r\nthat we shall have to rely mainly on our own resources if we are to proceed with our development. It is clear that we cannot continue to draw on our\r\ninternational reserve at the present rate. But a slackening for a time of our consumption of dollars would mean either cutting down our imports of\r\nmachinery and raw materials\u2014or sacrificing more of our consumer imports in favor of the industrial. The cause of economic progress constrains us to take\r\nthe latter course, while efforts are being exerted to explore sources of new capital from abroad.\r\nWe cannot expect to bring about the degree of economic improvement which we have set for our country without diverting a higher proportion of the national\r\nincome to cap\u00adital investment. Such a course inescapably entails our fore\u00adgoing of less essential consumption and wasteful investment. This implies a\r\npolicy of voluntary austerity on the part of our people since we are a democratic nation. Sacrifice and a policy of austerity will have to be adopted\r\ntemporarily on many fronts.\r\n\r\nAusterity as a policy means temper\u00adate spending. It signifies more work, more thrift, more pro\u00adductive investment, and more efficiency. It means less\r\nim\u00adports and less extravagant consumption. It is a challenge to our resiliency as a people to change our past habits and make thrift and economy our\r\neveryday way of living. Im\u00adposed on us by harsh realities; the exercise of austerity in our everyday life is a desirable end in itself. The Govern\u00adment\r\nwill do all in its power to direct the main impact of this policy against, extravagant consumption and ostenta\u00adtious living in a way that: will not affect\r\nthe basic living standard of the ordinary individual. Curbing such con\u00adsumption and eliminating wasteful and unproductive activ\u00adities the only safe and\r\nsound way by which we can move ahead in our development program without running the risk of national retrogression. The situation calls for continuing\r\nenergetic and courageous action on our part.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of 1957, the Central Bank tightened existing selective control measures directed to meet the urgent requirements of trade and\r\nindustry and arrest the expansion of credit for non-\u00adproductive and speculative activities. Parallel to this, the bond financing of P264 million announced\r\nto Congress by my late predecessor was reduced to P250 million in May 1957 and to P194 million in August of the same year. Early this year, the amount was\r\nfurther pared down to P145 million.\r\nOther measures of monetary retrenchment included the raising of the rediscount rate to 4 \u00bd per cent in September and the imposition of pre-import cash\r\ndeposits in December.\r\nThe Cabinet is studying ways and means of suspending temporarily certain public services or expenditures that can be deferred. To improve our international\r\nreserve position, I have plugged loopholes in our controls and have suspended private barter transactions. I have also created a Producers Incentives\r\nCommittee to look into feasible and practical ways of stimulating production, especially for exports. I am now exploring ways of promoting export expansion\r\nto bolster our international reserve. Arrangements for the receipt and distribution of Japanese reparations have been advanced.\r\nThese measures we have adopted so far to relieve the mounting strain on our scare resources, may be drastic in certain respects. They are however,\r\nnecessary to provide economy with a breathing period. Meantime, we are changing the phase of our economic program on a more selective basis to ensure that\r\nour efforts and resources, instead of being dissipated, are devoted first to the most important economic pursuits.\r\nWhile adhering to the long-range overall goal of a balanced agro-industrial economic development, we have short-range targets that require our immediate\r\nand urgent attention if we are to surmount our present difficulties.\r\n\r\nOur first and immediate goal, as I have already announced in my inaugural address, is self-sufficiency in food, specifically in rice, corn, and fish. It is\r\na challenge to our industry and sense of proportion as a people that, blessed with vast and virgin lands and a favourable climate, we have so far failed to\r\nproduce enough rice and corn to feed ourselves. Likewise, endowed with great bodies of water from which fish of all varieties can be had for the taking, we\r\ncannot supply even the minimum needs of our people. Yet, these commodities are the real index to our national well-being. They also exert a profound\r\ninfluence on the general level of prices. Abundant cheap rice may be our most effective weapon against inflation. I therefore propose an intensified rice\r\nproduction estimated to cost P20 million and expected to increase the rice yield by 6 million cavanes in the first year alone which, at P10 per cavan,\r\nwould mean P60 million additional income,\r\n\u2014 Under this program, we envisaged: (a) the distribution of fertilizers, selected seeds and insecticides to small farmers of food crops; (b) the speeding\r\nup of the completion of irrigation projects now underway; and (c) the building of impounding reservoirs to guarantee adequate water supply even during\r\ndrought. We must provide other aids and devise incentives, preferably in kind, and emphasize intensive and scientific cultivation. Similar measures must be\r\ntaken with respect to fish and fowls and livestock.\r\nApropos of producing more foodstuffs, I further recom\u00admend that the fullest encouragement be given to food conser\u00advation and food preserving industries.\r\nThe attainment of food sufficiency projected in this program can be of only limited benefits unless the surplus can be processed and stored for future use.\r\nThis should help to ensure year-round availability of otherwise perishable commodities and to eliminate sharp seasonal price fluctuations.\r\nI would also like to see the establishment of more com\u00admodity exchanges for our agricultural crops.\r\nWe must not take for granted that our natural resources cannot be exhausted. They are direct blessings from the Divine Providence and it behooves us to\r\nutilize them econo\u00admically and scientifically and to conserve and preserve them properly. The cutting of timber must be followed by reforestation; fishing\r\nmust be followed by replenishment of our river and lakes with fry; mining must be done with high recovery method; and farming must be done with\r\nrefertilization.\r\nWe often tell ourselves that we have natural resources greater in proportion than those of most other countries in the world. This is true. We have mineral\r\nwealth beneath our valleys and in the bowels of our mountains. Our nickel deposits in the Surigao reservation alone are said to be worth P10 million. In\r\nthis connection, may I invite the attention of Congress that the law authorizing the develop\u00adment and exploitation of the Surigao deposits failed to\r\nattract bidders and should be amended, to liberalize its terms.\r\nPerhaps even more important than the exploitation of our natural resources, however, is their proper conservation. All ways and means to stop the\r\ndynamiting of fish must be found; we must intensify fish culture in our fishing grounds. The law requiring the reforestation of areas subjected to lumber\r\noperation has not worked in practice, resulting in denuded forests and consequent disastrous floods and droughts. It will perhaps be necessary to withhold\r\nthe release of cut timber from sale until after the concessionaire has complied with reforestation requirements. Mining must be scientific so that\r\nextraction is thorough. Unextracted ores in abandoned or collapsed tunnels or pits are in most cases forever given up and lost. . Lands must not be allowed\r\nto reach exhaustion but must be constantly kept productive by contour plowing, fertilizing, fallowing and other scientific measures. Our natural resources\r\nhave been extended by the Almighty for the benefit of Filipinos until the end of time. It is our sacred obligation to conserve our national patrimony and\r\ntransmit it to our posterity undiminished until time is no more.\r\nIntensive and extensive scientific research\r\na necessary hand-maiden of both the utilization and conservation of natural resources. I,\r\ntherefore, request more appropriations for scientific research. Positive encouragement must be extended to private industry and the universities to enable\r\nthem to cooperate to their fullest capacity with the Govern\u00adment to the end that they may ultimately take over the burden of such research work. The\r\nreduction of production costs, for instance, perhaps by simplified and more scientific procedures and by increased utilization of by-products, may save\r\nmany of our export industries from adverse effects of the liquidation of the free trade with the United States. Research may enable us to raise all the\r\ncotton and ramie we need for our textile industry, kenaf for our bags, and the rubber for our tire and rubber industry. It may lead to the discovery of new\r\nuses, as raw materials or food or medicine or chemicals, of our crops, plants, and other pro\u00adducts, and to the invention of machines and equipment suited\r\nto our farms, forests, and other needs.\r\nI urge the coordination of the work of the different re\u00adsearch and scientific agencies with a view to obtaining maximum results.\r\nAs a first step towards the stabilization of the fiscal posi\u00adtion of the Government, we must reinvigorate our revenue collection services by extending\r\ntheir intensive efforts in areas beyond Manila and take the necessary measures to insure that existing taxes are collected efficiently and equitably. To\r\nsupplement our present revenues to meet the expanding needs of our growing population for essential government services, I am presenting in my budget\r\nmessage tax proposals designed to distribute the tax burden justly and fairly in accordance with the principle of ability to pay.\r\nI propose a re-examination of the present policy of grant\u00ading tax exemption to new and necessary industries with a view to correcting certain unsound\r\npattern of investment resulting from the present policy.\r\nWe must revise our policy of price support so as to exclude low-grade or sub-standard products. The need for this re\u00advision is clearly demonstrated by the\r\nprice support given to leaf tobacco under Republic Act No. 1194. To encourage low-grade production is wasteful and self-defeating.\r\nWe are committed to a gradual removal of controls. To\u00adwards this end, even within the restrictions of the Laurel-Langely Agreement, we must make more\r\nresourceful uses of tariffs such as the more widespread and more ingenious application of special duties.\r\nAs demonstrated by our experience, our economic devel\u00adopment hinges significantly on our export trade; neverthe\u00adless, several of our export promotion\r\nmeasures have not been updated since we became independent. In order to make export expansion more feasible, I submit the following measures for your\r\nconsideration:\r\n1. To give top priority and incentives to more extensive processing of local raw materials whose production or ex\u00adtraction has already undergone some\r\ndevelopment. Such incentives may take the form of preferential treatment for processed goods out of local raw materials as against the export of materials\r\nin their raw state..\r\n2. To make more vigorous use of economic diplomacy for the more profitable marketing of our products and the development of new markets.\r\n3. To broaden the economic functions of our overseas diplomatic and consular offices.\r\n4. To improve the quality of our export products.\r\n5. To accelerate the diversification of our export trade by promoting research, market studies, improvement of pro\u00adducts, and greater utilization of\r\nby-products.\r\n6. To set up standards and grades for our manufactured products which should be effectively administered.\r\nWe must channel most of our credit and financial resources to enterprises that are immediately productive, particularly those that turn out goods needed by\r\nour people.\r\nIn line with the policy of doing first things first, I recom\u00admend that all arms and instruments of the government charged with the formulation and\r\nimplementation of eco\u00adnomic policies be endowed with efficient and effective or\u00adganizations. I, therefore, urge the amendment of the Cen\u00adtral Bank Charter\r\nso as to make possible the appointment of more members of the Monetary Board on full-time basis. I submit that the National Economic Council, while it\r\nshould maintain its advisory character should be provided with an\u2019 executive arm to carry out the economic policies approved by the Council and confirmed\r\nby the President.\r\n\u2014 It is also my considered opinion and I so recommend:\r\nThat the proceeds from the sales of capital goods from reparations should constitute a perpetual source of funds for investment in our economic\r\ndevelopment. To this end, the establishment of an Economic Development Bank capitalized with these proceeds is indicated. This is perhaps the only way to\r\nbring our people not only of this generation but of those yet to be born the benefits of reparations.\r\n\u2014 Likewise, we should look into ways and means of flushing out hoarded capital so that it may be gainfully utilized. As an inducement for domestic capital\r\nto come out of hiding, we may offer tax amnesty and set higher interest rates for savings and time deposits.\r\nWhile economic controls cannot be immediately abolished, we must see to it that the administrative difficulties inherent in controls be kept to a minimum.\r\nAs earlier stated, some of the objectives of these controls can be attained through a wise management of the tariff and customs laws which, however, will\r\nrequire amendatory legislation. The creation of a single agency of full-time members to centralize economic controls which are at present handled by the\r\nCentral Bank, the Department of Commerce, the NAMARCO, and the Export Control Committee may be necessary while the government is directing its efforts to\r\ndo away ultimately with controls.\r\nAt the same time we are stepping up the campaign against smuggling at our ports, sea frontiers, and other areas in order to prevent the leakage of dollars\r\nand the evasion of taxes.\r\nWe must try to get the optimum advantage out of our limited foreign exchange resources by funnelling them to these industries that can contribute most to\r\nour national income. Overcrowding in many industries needing imported capital equipment, investing in many lines of production not basic to our\r\ndevelopment, and importation of non-essential consumption goods are unnecessary drains on our foreign exchange. We should bring existing industries to\r\ntheir efficient productive capacity before going ahead with any but the most necessary new ventures.\r\nOur domestic transportation system must be extensively revamped so as to do away with wasteful practices and conserve fuel and spare parts.\r\nThe NAMARCO should shift more of its activities to handling local manufacturers. Its dollar quota should be used for legitimate needs of Filipino retail\r\nbusiness in accordance with the spirit of the Retail Trade Nationalization Act.\r\nWe must try to extend greater incentives and encouragement to our small producers on the cottage industry level.\r\nProperly developed, this broad sector of the national produc\u00adtivity will be a tremendous boost to our economy as well as an additional means of tapping the\r\ntalents and ingenuity which we as a people possess. These cottage industries, integrated and strengthened through the establishment of a common clearing\r\nhouse for the regulation of standards as well as for marketing and financing facilities, can become a solid base for further industrial growth.\r\nWe must define in clear terms our foreign investment policy. It is my considered opinion that foreign invest\u00adments, through welcome, should be admitted on\r\na selective basis in order that legitimate Filipino business may be protected, particularly in fields already being fully exploited by our own nationals.\r\nThe remittance of net profits and repatriation of capital by foreign investors should be under most reasonable terms compatible with our exchange\r\nre\u00adsources and development program. While efforts to obtain foreign loans for our development is believed necessary, domestic capital must be encouraged to\r\nparticipate fully in Philippine business.\r\nI must invite your urgent attention to the rise in prices of prime commodities, which appears to be artificial, that is causing undue hardships to our\r\npeople. The preserva\u00adtion of the nation is the supreme law which no one can violate with impunity. I, therefore, ask Congress for broad powers to handle\r\nthe situation swiftly and effectively in order to protect the people from those who would exploit them and who seem motivated by insatiable greed for\r\nprofit.\r\nThe advent of radical changes in military concepts oc\u00adcasioned by the strides made in science and technology makes it imperative for us to place under\r\nconstant review the problems and requirements of our national defense es\u00adtablishment.\r\nAs the minimum requirement of adequate defense, I have earlier emphasized the necessity of reassessing the organ\u00adizational structure of our Armed Forces in\r\nsuch a way as to make it a balanced and effective instrument for national defense. The aims of such a reassessment is to make our defense plans\r\nrealistically consistent with our national cap\u00adability.\r\nI believe that our best contribution to our allies in the de\u00adfense of the free world lies first in our ability to maintain peace and security in our own\r\ncountry.\r\nI endorse the modernization of our Armed Forces as far as our resources would permit.\r\nI would like to restate solemnly my stand in favor of world disarmament. We should support in every possible and rea\u00adsonable way all sincere efforts\r\ntowards world disarmament. I understand that the world powers have spent and are spending billions of dollars in the armament race. With world disarmament,\r\nthis huge expenditure can be devoted to the removal of the causes of war and the promotion of human welfare. In this way the human race will be as\u00adsured of\r\npeace, goodwill, happiness, and contentment.\r\nIt is time to gear our educational system to our economic development program. Since up-to-date textbooks and modern equipment essential to efficient\r\ninstruction are not being supplied adequately to our schools, their acquisition through sufficient appropriation should be given serious con\u00adsideration.\r\nAs a means of augmenting our foreign earnings, we must promote tourism and improve local facilities to take care of the increased passenger and cargo\r\ntraffic that passes through our country. Our cultural landmarks and public places must be kept in good condition, and new facilities for cultural\r\nexpression and preservation must be provided. Art is dear to the Filipino soul.\r\nWe must improve and expand our social services. To the many measures long in effect to promote this objective, was added only five months ago the Social\r\nSecurity Law which providesa system of mass insurance covering the non-governmental sector against disability, sickness, old age, and death. Before the\r\npassage of the law, less than three per cent of our nine million labor force enjoyed the protec\u00adtion of social insurance.\r\nThe combined savings of non-governmental employees augmented by the contribution, of employers have already placed in the coffers of the system the sum of\r\nP9 million which, invested in RFC bonds, has become available for economic development. In time, the system will be one of the richest sources of such\r\ncapital. It appears advisable, however, that the law creating the system be amended to improve the benefits and conditions of membership and to make the\r\nsystem a more effective source of funds for eco\u00adnomic development.\r\nI shall continue to insist on honesty and integrity in the public service. I must serve stern warning that erring public servants will be dealt with\r\nseverely but justly. De\u00adserving employees, however, will be rewarded. This Ad\u00administration will exert its utmost in combating all forms of graft and\r\ncorruption in the government.\r\ngentlemen of the congress: I have tried to report to you the true state of the nation. In addition to the rec\u00adommendations I have submitted, I may from\r\ntime to time during your session submit other recommendations for your consideration. I am sure that with the guidance of the Divine Providence and the\r\nunstinted cooperation of Con\u00adgress, which counts among its members some of the finest minds and talents in our country, we shall in this crucial year begin\r\nour tenure by meeting the great expectations of our people with decisiveness, swiftness, boldness, and patriotism.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},

Parang kailan lang nang sabay-sabay tayong nagpasyang tahakin ang tuwid na daan. Parang kailan lang nang sinimulan nating iwaksi ang wang-wang, hindi lamang sa kalsada kundi sa sistemang panlipunan.\r\nDalawang taon na ang nakalipas mula nang sinabi ninyo, \u201cSawa na kami sa korupsyon; sawa na kami sa kahirapan.\u201d Oras na upang ibalik ang isang pamahalaang tunay na kakampi ng taumbayan.\r\nGaya ng marami sa inyo, namulat ako sa panggigipit ng makapangyarihan. Labindalawang-taong gulang po ako nang idineklara ang Batas Militar. Bumaliktad ang aming mundo: Pitong taon at pitong buwang ipiniit ang aking ama; tatlong taong napilitang mangibang-bansa ang aking pamilya; naging saksi ako sa pagdurusa ng marami dahil sa diktadurya. Dito napanday ang aking prinsipyo: Kung may inaagrabyado\u2019t ninanakawan ng karapatan, siya ang kakampihan ko. Kung may abusadong mapang-api, siya ang lalabanan ko. Kung may makita akong mali sa sistema, tungkulin kong itama ito. [\r\n]\r\nMatagal nang tapos ang Batas Militar. Tinanong tayo noon, \u201cKung hindi tayo, sino pa?\u201d at \u201cKung hindi ngayon, kailan pa?\u201d Ang nagkakaisang tugon natin: tayo at ngayon na. Ang demokrasyang ninakaw gamit ang paniniil at karahasan, nabawi natin sa mapayapang paraan; matagumpay nating pinag-alab ang liwanag mula sa pinakamadilim na kabanata ng ating kasaysayan.\r\nNgunit huwag po nating kalimutan ang pinag-ugatan ng Batas Militar: Kinasangkapan ng diktador ang Saligang Batas upang manatili sa kapangyarihan. At hanggang ngayon, tuloy pa rin ang banggaan sa pagitan ng gusto ng sistemang parehas, laban sa mga nagnanais magpatuloy ng panlalamang.\r\nMula sa unang araw ng ating panunungkulan, walang ibang sumalubong sa atin kundi ang mga bangungot ng nawalang dekada.\r\nNariyan po ang kaso ng North Rail. Pagkamahal-mahal na nga nito, matapos ulitin ang negosasyon, nagmahal pa lalo. Sa kabila nito, binawasan ang benepisyo. Ang labingsiyam na train sets naging tatlo, at sa mga estasyon, mula lima, naging dalawa. Ang masaklap pa po, pinapabayaran na sa atin ang utang nito, now na.\r\nNariyan ang walang pakundangang bonus sa ilang GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation], sa kabila ng pagkalugi ng kanilang mga ahensya. Nariyan ang 1 bilyong pisong pinasingaw ng PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation] \u00a0para sa kape. Nariyan ang sistemang pamamahala sa PNP [Philippine National Police] na isinantabi ang pangangailangan sa armas ng 45 porsiyento ng kapulisan, para lang kumita mula sa lumang helicopter na binili sa presyong brand new.\r\nWala na ngang iniwang panggastos, patung-patong at sabay-sabay pa ang mga utang na kailangang bayaran na. Mahaba ang iniwang listahan na tungkulin nating punuan: Ang 66,800 na backlog sa classrooms, na nagkakahalaga ng tinatayang 53.44 billion pesos; ang 2,573,212 na backlog sa mga upuan, na nagkakahalaga naman ng 2.31 billion pesos. Nang dumating tayo, may halos 36 na milyong Pilipinong hindi pa miyembro ng PhilHealth. Ang kailangan para makasali sila: maaaring umabot sa 42 billion pesos. Idagdag pa po natin sa lahat ng iyan ang 103 billion pesos na kailangan para sa modernisasyon ng Hukbong Sandatahan. Sa harap ng lahat ng ito, ang iniwan sa ating pondo na malaya nating magagamit: 6.5 percent ng kabuuang budget para sa natitirang anim na buwan ng 2010. Para po tayong boksingerong isinabak sa laban nang nakagapos na nga ang mga kamay at paa, nakapiring pa ang mga mata, at kakampi pa ng kalaban ang referee at ang mga judge.\r\nKaya nga sa unang tatlong buwan ng aming panunungkulan, inaabangan namin ang pagdating ng Linggo para maidulog sa Panginoon ang mga bangungot na humaharap sa amin. Inasahan naming mangangailangan ng di bababa sa dalawang taon bago magkaroon ng makabuluhang pagbabago. Bibigyan kaya tayo ng sapat na pag-unawa ng taumbayan?\r\nSubalit kung may isang bagay mang nakatatak na sa ating lahi, at makailang ulit na nating pinatunayan sa buong mundo: Walang hindi makakaya ang nagkakaisang Pilipino. Nangarap po tayo ng pagbabago; nakamit natin ang pagbabago; at ngayon, karaniwan na ito. [\r\n]\r\nAng kalsadang pinondohan ninyo ay tuwid, patag, at walang bukol; ang tanging tongpats ay aspalto o semento. Karaniwan na po ito.\r\nAng sitwasyon kung paparating ang bagyo: nakaabang na ang relief, at hindi ang tao ang nag-aabang ng relief. Nag-aabang na ring umalalay ang rescue services sa taumbayan, at hindi tayu-tayo lang din ang sumasaklolo sa isa\u2019t isa. Karaniwan na \u00a0po ito.\r\nAng wang-wang sa lansangan, galing na lang sa pulis, ambulansya, o bumbero\u2014hindi sa opisyal ng gobyerno. Karaniwan na rin po ito. Ang gobyernong dating nang-aabuso, ngayon, tunay na kakampi na ng Pilipino. [\r\n]\r\nNagpatupad po tayo ng reporma: tinanggal ang gastusing hindi kailangan, hinabol ang mga tiwali, at ipinakita sa mundong open for business under new management na ang Pilipinas.\r\nAng dating sick man of Asia, ngayon, punung-puno na ng sigla. Nang nagkaroon tayo ng positive credit rating action, ang sabi ng iba, tsamba. Ngayong walo na po sila, tsamba pa rin kaya? [\r\n] Sa Philippine Stock Exchange index, nang una nating nahigitan ang 4,000 na index, may mga nagduda. Ngayon, sa dami ng all-time high, pati economic managers, nahirapan yata sa pagbilang, at ako rin po ay nagulat: nakaka-44 na pala tayo, at bihira nang bumaba sa 5,000 ang index. [\r\n] Nito pong first quarter ng 2012, ang GDP growth natin, 6.4 percent; milya-milya ang layo niyan sa mga prediksyon, at pinakamataas sa buong Southeast Asian region; pangalawa po ito sa Asya, sunod lang tayo sa Tsina. [\r\n] Kung dati po, tayo ang laging nangungutang, ngayon, hindi po birong tayo na ang nagpapautang. [\r\n] Dati po\u2019y namamalimos tayo ng investments; ngayon, sila na ang dumadagsa. Ang mga kumpanyang Hapon, sa isang pagpupulong po namin, ang sabi ay, \u201cBaka gusto n\u2019yo kaming silipin. Hindi nga kami ang pinakamura, pero una naman kami sa teknolohiya.\u201d Pati pinuno ng isa pong malaking bangko sa Inglatera, kamakailan nakipag-usap sa atin, at ang sinabi, maisali sana sila sa ating kinukonsulta sa usapang pinansyal.\r\nSa bawat sulok ng mundo, nagpapakita ng paghanga ang mga komentarista. Ayon sa\r\n, and I quote: \u201cKeep an eye on the Philippines.\u201d Ang\r\nmagazine, pati isa sa mga pinuno ng ASEAN 100, nagsabing maaari daw tayong maging, and I quote, \u201cAsia\u2019s Next Tiger.\u201d [\r\n] Sabi ni Ruchir Sharma, pinuno ng Emerging Market Equities and Global Macro ng Morgan Stanley, I quote: \u201cThe Philippines is no longer a joke.\u201d At mukha naman pong hindi siya nambobola, dahil tinatayang 1 bilyong dolyar ang ipinasok ng kanyang kumpanya sa atin pong bansa. [\r\n] Sana nga po, ang kaliwa\u2019t kanang paghanga ng taga-ibang bansa, masundan na rin ng lokal na tagapagbalita. [\r\n]\r\nSinisiguro po nating umaabot ang kaunlaran sa mas nakakarami. Alalahanin po natin: Nang mag-umpisa tayo, may 760,357 na kabahayang benepisyaryo ang\r\n. Tinarget [target] natin itong paabutin sa 3.1 million sa loob ng dalawang taon. Pebrero pa lang po ng taong ito, naiparehistro na ang ika-3 milyong kabahayang benepisyaryo ng Pantawid Pamilya. [\r\n] Sa susunod na taon naman, palalawakin pa natin ang sakop nito sa 3.8 milyong bahay; limang beses po ang laki niyan sa dinatnan natin.\r\nPangmatagalan po ang impact ng proyektong ito. Hindi pa kumpleto ang mga pag-aaral, pero ngayon pa lang, maganda na ang ipinapakita ng numero. Base sa listahan ng DSWD [Department of Social Welfare and Development]: may 1,672,977 na mga inang regular nang nagpapa-checkup. Idagdag pa natin, 1,672,814 na mga batang napabakunahan laban sa diarrhea, polio, tigdas, at iba pa; 4.57 million na estudyanteng hindi na napipilitang mag-absent dahil sa kahirapan. [\r\n]\r\nSa kalusugan naman po: Nang dumating tayo, 62 porsiyento lamang ng mga Pilipino ang naka-enrol sa PhilHealth. Ang masaklap, hindi pa masiguro kung lahat sila ay kabilang sa mga totoong nangangailangan ng kalinga ng estado, o buwenas lang na malapit sa politiko. Ngayon po, 85 percent ng lahat ng mamamayan, miyembro na nito. [\r\n] Ang ibig pong sabihin, 23.31 million na Pilipino ang naidagdag sa mga saklaw ng PhilHealth mula nang bigyan tayo ng mandato. [\r\n]\r\nAng maganda pa rito: Ang 5.2 million na pinakamahirap na kabahayang tinukoy ng National Household Targeting System, buong-buo at walang-bayad nang makikinabang sa benepisyo ng PhilHealth. [\r\n] Dahil po sa No Balance Billing policy ng Department of Health, ang lunas para sa dengue, pneumonia, asthma, katarata, gayundin ang pagpapagamot sa mga catastrophic disease tulad ng breast cancer, prostate cancer, at acute leukemia, makukuha na nang libre ng mga pinakamahirap nating kababayan. [\r\n]\r\nIto po ang proseso ng pagpapagamot para sa kanila: Papasok ka sa alinmang ospital ng gobyerno. Ipapakita mo ang iyong PhilHealth card. Magpapagamot ka. At uuwi kang maginhawa nang walang inilabas ni isang kusing.\r\nSabi nga po sa isa sa mga briefing na dinaluhan natin, 4 sa 10 Pilipino, hindi man lamang nakakakita ng health professional sa tanang buhay nila. Sa iba po, mas malaki pa: May nagsasabing 6 sa bawat 10 Pilipino ang pumapanaw nang malayo sa kalinga ng health professional. Anuman ang ating pagbatayan, hindi po maikakaila: Nakakabahala ang bilang ng mga Pilipinong hindi naaabot ang serbisyong pangkalusugan ng pamahalaan. Tinutugunan na po natin ito. Mula sa 10,000 noong dumating tayo, umabot na sa 30,801 ang mga nurse at midwife na ating nai-deploy sa ilalim ng RNHeals Program. [\r\n] Idagdag pa po natin sa kanila ang mahigit 11,000 Community Health Teams na nagsisilbing tulay upang higit na mapatibay ang ugnayan ng mga doktor at nurse sa komunidad.\r\nAt kung dati tutungo lamang ang mga nurse kung saan makursunadahan ng kanilang hepe, ngayon, dahil sa tamang targeting, kung saan sila kailangan, doon sila ipinapadala: [\r\n] sa mga lugar na matagal nang naiwan sa laylayan ng lipunan. Ipinadala po natin ang ating mga health professional sa 1,021 na pook na saklaw ng Pantawid Pamilya, at sa 609 na pinakamahihirap na lungsod at munisipyo, ayon sa pag-aaral ng National Anti-Poverty Commission. [\r\n]\r\nDalawang problema po ang natutugunan nito: Bukod sa nagkakatrabaho at nabibigyan ng work experience ang libu-libong nurse at midwife na dati ay walang mapaglalaanan ng kanilang kaalaman, nagiging abot-kamay din ang dekalidad na kalinga para sa milyun-milyon nating kababayan.\r\nSubalit hindi pa po tayo makukuntento rito, dahil ang hangad natin: kalusugang pangkalahatan. Nagsisimula ito hindi sa mga pagamutan, kundi sa loob mismo ng kanya-kanya nating tahanan. Ibayong kaalaman, bakuna, at checkup ang kailangan upang mailayo tayo sa karamdaman. Dagdag pa po diyan ang pagsisikap nating iwasan ang mga sakit na puwede namang iwasan.\r\nHalimbawa: Nabanggit ko ang mosquito traps kontra dengue noong nakaraang taon. Alam naman po ninyo, ang mga siyentipiko mahigpit sa pagsisiyasat. Kaya maaga pa para sabihing siguradong-sigurado na tayo, pero nakakaengganyo po ang mga paunang resulta nitong programang ito.\r\nSinubok natin ang bisa ng mosquito traps sa mga lugar kung saan naitala ang pinakamataas na insidente ng dengue. Sa buong probinsya ng Bukidnon noong 2010, may 1,216 na kaso. Nang inilagay ang mga mosquito trap noong 2011: mukhang nakatulong dahil bumaba ito sa 37; 97 percent daw po ang reduction nito. [\r\n] Sa mga bayan ng Ballesteros at Claveria sa Cagayan, may 228 na kaso ng dengue noong 2010. Pagdating ng 2011, walo na lang ang naitala. Sa Catarman, Northern Samar: 434 na kaso ng dengue noong 2010, naging apat na lang noong 2011. [\r\n]\r\nPanimulang pag-aaral pa lamang po ito. Pero ngayon pa lang, marapat na yata nating pasalamatan sina Secretary Ike Ona ng DOH [Department of Health] at Secretary Mario Montejo ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology]. [\r\n] Wala ho tayong masyadong umento, baka sa palakpak ninyo\u2019y ganahan silang lalong magsaliksik at mag-ugnayan.\r\nMarami pa po tayong kailangang solusyonan. Nakakabahala ang mataas pa ring maternal mortality ratio ng bansa. Kaya nga po gumagawa tayo ng mga hakbang upang tugunan ang pangangailangan sa kalusugan ng kababaihan. Nais din nating makamit ang Universal Health Care, at magkaroon ng sapat na kagamitan, pasilidad, at tauhan ang ating mga institusyong pangkalusugan.\r\nSa pagtugon natin sa mga ito, malaki ang maiaambag ng\r\n. Maipasa na po sana ito sa lalong madaling panahon. [\r\n] Mababawasan na ang bisyo, madadagdagan pa ang pondo para sa kalusugan.\r\nAno naman kaya ang sasalubong sa kabataan pagpasok sa paaralan? Sa lilim ng puno pa rin kaya sila unang matututo ng abakada? Nakasalampak pa rin kaya sila sa sahig habang nakikipag-agawan ng textbook sa kaklase nila?\r\nMatibay po ang pananalig natin kay Secretary Luistro: Bago matapos ang susunod na taon, ubos na ang minana nating 66,800 na kakulangan sa silid-aralan. [\r\n] Uulitin ko lang po, next year po \u2018yan; 40,000 pa lang ho this year. Ang minana po nating 2,573,212 na backlog sa upuan, tuluyan na rin nating matutugunan bago matapos ang 2012. [\r\n] Sa taon din pong ito, masisimot na rin ang 61.7 million na backlog sa textbook upang maabot na, sa wakas, ang one-is-to-one ratio ng aklat sa mag-aaral. [\r\n] Sana nga po, ngayong paubos na ang backlog sa edukasyon, sikapin nating huwag uling magka-backlog dahil sa dami ng estudyante. Sa tingin ko po,\r\nang sagot dito. [\r\n]\r\nAt para naman po hindi mapag-iwanan ang ating mga state universities and colleges (SUCs), mayroon tayong panukalang 43.61 percent na pag-angat sa kanilang budget para sa susunod na taon. [\r\n] Paalala lang po: Lahat ng ginagawa natin, may direksyon; may kaakibat na kondisyon ang dagdag-budget na ito. Kailangang ipatupad ang napagkasunduang SUC Reform Roadmap ng CHED [Commission on Higher Education] at ng kaukulang mga state universities and colleges, upang siguruhing dekalidad ang magiging produkto ng mga pamantasang pinopondohan ng estado. Kung mataas ang grado ninyo sa assignment na ito, asahan naman ninyong dodoblehin din namin ang kayod para matugunan ang mga natitirang pangangailangan po ninyo. [\r\n]\r\nPanay addition po ang nagaganap sa ating budget sa edukasyon. Isipin po ninyo: Ang budget ng DepEd na ipinamana sa atin noong 2010, 177 billion pesos. Ang panukala natin para sa 2013: 292.7 billion pesos. [\r\n] Noong 2010, 21.03 billion pesos ang budget para sa SUCs. Taunan po iyang dinagdagan upang umabot na sa 37.13 billion pesos na panukala natin para sa 2013. [\r\n] Pero sa kabila nito, ngayon pa lang, may nagpaplano nang magcut-classes para mag-picket sa Mendiola. Ganito po kasimple: Ang 292.7 ay mas malaki sa 177, at ang 37.13 ay mas malaki sa 21.03. Kaya kung may nagsasabi o magsasabi pa ring binawasan natin ang budget ng edukasyon, kukumbinsihin na lang namin ang inyong mga paaralan na maghandog ng remedial math class para sa inyo. [\r\n] At sana naman po, sa mga klaseng \u2018to, pakiusap po namin, sana itong klaseng remedial na nga eh pasukan naman po ninyo.\r\nNang maupo tayo, at masimulan ang makabuluhang reporma, minaliit ng ilan ang pagpapakitang-gilas ng pamahalaan. Kundi raw buwenas, ningas-kugon lang itong mauupos rin paglaon. May ilan pa rin pong ayaw magretiro sa paghahasik ng negatibismo; silang mga tikom ang bibig sa good news, at ginawang industriya na ang kritisismo.\r\nKung may problema kayo na bago matapos ang taon, bawat bata ay may sarili nang upuan at aklat, tingnan ninyo sila, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, \u201cAyaw kong makapag-aral ka.\u201d\r\nKung masama ang loob ninyo na ang 5.2 million na pinakamahihirap na kabahayang Pilipino ay maaari nang pumasok sa ospital nang hindi iniintindi ang gastos sa pagpapagamot, tingnan ninyo sila ulit, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, \u201cAyaw kong gumaling ka.\u201d\r\nKung nagagalit kayo na may 3 milyong pamilyang Pilipino nang tumutungo sa katuparan ng kanilang mga pangarap dahil sa Pantawid Pamilya, tingnan ninyo sila, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, \u201cIbabalik ko kayo sa kawalan ng pag-asa.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nTapos na ang panahon kung kailan choice lang ng makapangyarihan ang mahalaga. Halimbawa, ang dating namumuno sa TESDA [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority], nagpamudmod ng mga scholarship voucher; ang problema, wala palang nakalaang pondo para rito. Natural, tatalbog ang voucher. Ang napala: 2.4 billion pesos ang sinisingil ng mahigit 1,000 eskwelahan mula sa pamahalaan. Nagpapapogi ang isang tao\u2019t isang administrasyon; sambayanang Pilipino naman ang pinagbabayad ngayon.\r\nPumasok si Secretary Joel Villanueva; [\r\n] hindi siya nagpasindak sa tila imposibleng pagbabagong dapat ipatupad sa kanyang ahensya. Sa kabila ng malaking utang na minana ng TESDA, 434,676 na indibidwal pa rin ang kanilang hinasa sa ilalim ng Training for Work Scholarship Program. [\r\n] Konkretong tagumpay din po ang hatid ng TESDA Specialista Technopreneurship Program (mas mahirap pong bigkasin kaysa sa resulta). Biruin po ninyo, bawat isa sa 5,240 na sertipikadong Specialistas, kumikita na ngayon ng 562 pesos kada araw o 11,240 pesos kada buwan. Mas malaki pa po ito sa minimum wage. [\r\n]\r\nMula sa pagkasanggol, hanggang sa pagkabinata, gumagana na ang sistema para sa mamamayan. Sinisiguro nating manganganak ng trabaho ang pagsigla ng ating ekonomiya.\r\nAlalahanin po natin, para tumabla lang, kailangang makalikha taun-taon ng 1 milyong bagong trabaho para sa mga new entrants. Ang nalikha po natin sa loob ng dalawang taon: halos 3.1 million na bagong trabaho. [\r\n]\r\nIto po ang dahilan kung bakit pababa nang pababa ang unemployment rate sa bansa. Nang dumating tayo, 8 percent ang unemployment rate. Naging 7.2 ito noong Abril ng 2011, at bumaba pa lalo sa 6.9 ngayong taon, sa buwan rin ng Abril. [\r\n] Di po ba makatwirang mangarap na balang araw, bawat Pilipinong handang magbanat ng buto, may mapapasukang trabaho?\r\nTingnan na lamang po natin ang BPO [business process outsourcing] sector. Noong taong 2000, 5,000 katao lang ang naempleyo sa industriyang ito. Fast forward po tayo ngayon: 638,000 katao na ang nabibigyang trabaho ng mga BPO, at 11 bilyong dolyar ang ipinasok nito sa ating ekonomiya noong taong 2011. [\r\n] Ang projection nga po ng industriya, pagdating ng 2016, kung saan ako po ay magpapaalam na sa inyo, 25 billion dollars na ang maipapasok nito, at makakapag-empleyo ng 1.3 million na mga Pilipino. [\r\n] Hindi pa po kasama rito ang tinatayang aabot sa 3.2 million na mga taxi driver, barista, mga sari-sari store, karinderya, at marami pang ibang makikinabang sa mga indirect jobs na malilikha dahil sa BPO industry.\r\nMalaking bahagi din po ng ating job-generation strategy ang pagpapatayo ng sapat na imprastraktura. Sa mga nakapagbakasyon na sa Boracay, nakita na naman ninyo ang bagong-binyag nating terminal sa Caticlan. Nakalatag na rin po ang plano upang palawakin ang runway nito.\r\nMagkakaroon pa po \u2018yan ng mga kapatid. Bago matapos ang aking termino, nakatayo na ang New Bohol Airport sa Panglao, [\r\n] New Legaspi Airport sa Daraga, at Laguindingan Airport sa Misamis Oriental. [\r\n] Ia-upgrade na rin po natin ang ating international airports sa Mactan, Puerto Princesa, at Tacloban. [\r\n] Dagdag pa po diyan ang pagpapaganda ng mga airport sa Butuan, Cotabato, Dipolog, Pagadian, Tawi-Tawi, Southern Leyte, at San Vicente sa Palawan. [\r\n] Kami po sa Tarlac ay maghihintay na lang. [\r\n]\r\nPang-apat na Pangulo na po akong sasalo sa problema ng NAIA 3. Hindi lang po eroplano ang nag-take off at nag-landing dito; maging mga problema\u2019t anomalya, lumapag din. Nagbitiw na po ng salita si Secretary Mar Roxas: Bago tayo magkita sa susunod na SONA, maisasaayos na ang mga structural defects na minana natin sa NAIA 3. [\r\n]\r\nNitong Hunyo po, nagsimula na ring umusad ang proseso para sa LRT Line 1 Cavite Extension project, na magpapaluwag sa trapik ng Las Pi\u00f1as, Para\u00f1aque, at Cavite. [\r\n] Dagdag pa diyan, para lalong mapaluwag ang traffic sa Kamaynilaan at mapabilis ang pagtawid mula North Luzon hanggang South Luzon Expressway, magkakaroon ng dalawang elevated NLEX-SLEX connector. Matatapos po ang mga ito sa 2015. [\r\n] Magiging 1 hour and 40 minutes na lang ang biyaheng Clark papuntang Calamba oras na makumpleto ang mga ito. Bago po tayo bumaba sa puwesto, nakatayo na rin ang mga dekalidad na terminal sa Taguig, Quezon City, at Para\u00f1aque na paparadahan ng bus biyaheng probinsya, [\r\n] upang hindi na sila makisiksik pa sa EDSA.\r\nNagbago na po ang takbo ng usapan tungkol sa ahensyang dati\u2019y itinuturing na pugad ng kapalpakan. Naalala ko po dati: Kapag tag-ulan at umapaw ang Tarlac River, nalulunod ang MacArthur Highway. Tutunawin nito ang aspalto; magbabaku-bako ang kalsada hanggang sa tuluyan na nga itong mawawala. Bilang kinatawan noon ng aking distrito, inireklamo ko po ito. Ang tugon ng DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways]: Alam namin ang problema, alam namin ang solusyon, pero wala kaming pera. Kinailangan ko pong makiusap sa aking mga barangay, at ang sabi ko po sa kanila ay, \u201cKung hindi natin ito uunahin, walang gagawa nito, at tayo rin ang mapeperhuwisyo.\u201d Dati, panay ang \u201choy, gising!\u201d sa gobyerno, bakit wala daw kasing ginagawa. Ngayon ang reklamo, \u201cSobra namang trapik, ang dami kasing ginagawa.\u201d [\r\n] Paalala lang din po: Naisasaayos na natin ang mga kalsadang ito nang hindi nagtataas ng buwis. [\r\n]\r\nBubuo tayo ng mga daanan, hindi ayon sa kickback o kursonada, pero ayon sa isang malinaw na sistema. Dahil hindi na bara-bara ang paglalagak natin ng pondo para sa mga proyekto, hindi na ito mapapako sa plano, totoong kalsada na ang pakikinabangan ng Pilipino. Nang maupo po tayo sa puwesto, 7,239 kilometers sa ating national road network ang hindi pa naisasaayos. One thousand five hundred and sixty-nine kilometers na nito ang naipaayos natin sa ilalim ng pamamahala ni Secretary Babes Singson; [\r\n] sa 2012, 2,275 kilometers pa ang maidadagdag na natapos na rin po. Pati po ang mga kalsada at kurbadang mapanganib, tinutukoy at inaayos na gamit ang pinakabagong teknolohiya. Taun-taon po nating bubunuin ito, upang bago matapos ang aking termino, bawat pulgada ng ating national road network, maayos na po. Siyempre \u2018wag lang po n\u2019yo dagdagan ang national road network.\r\nHindi lang kalsada, kundi pati sistema, isinasaayos sa DPWH. Dahil sa pagsunod sa tamang proseso ng bidding at procurement, 10.6 billion pesos na ang natipid ng kanilang ahensya mula 2011 hanggang nitong Hunyo. [\r\n] Maging mga kontratista, batid ang positibong bunga ng reporma sa DPWH. Sabi nga po nila, \u201cAng top 40 na kontratista, fully booked na raw po.\u201d\r\nSana po hindi maantala ang pagpapatayo natin ng iba pang imprastraktura para hindi rin mapurnada ang paglago ng ibang industriya.\r\nKaakibat ng pagpapaunlad ng imprastraktura ang paglago ng turismo. Isipin po ninyo: Noong 2001, ang tourist arrivals sa ating bansa, 1.8 million. Nang dumating po tayo noong 2010, naglalaro ito sa 3.1 million. Mantakin po ninyo: Sa hinaba-haba ng kanilang administrasyon, ang naidagdag nilang tourist arrivals, 1.3 million lamang; may ambag pa kaming kalahating taon diyan. Tayo naman po, Hunyo pa lang ng 2012, 2.1 million na turista na ang napalapag. [\r\n] Mas marami pang dadagsa sa peak season bago matapos ang taon, kaya hindi ako nagdududang maaabot natin ang quota na 4.6 million na turista para sa 2012. [\r\n] Ibig sabihin po, 1.5 million na turista ang ating maidadagdag. Samakatuwid, sa dalawang taon, mas malaki ang magiging paglago ng ating tourist arrivals, kumpara sa naidagdag ng pinalitan natin sa loob ng siyam at kalahating taon. Hindi po tayo nagtataas ng bangko; nagsasabi lang po tayo ng totoo. [\r\n]\r\nPero hindi nakuntento rito si Secretary Mon Jimenez. Sabi niya, kung sa Malaysia may bumisitang 24.7 million na turista noong 2011, at kung sa Thailand naman tinatayang 17 million, sa dinami-dami ng magagandang tanawin sa ating bansa, hindi naman siguro suntok sa buwan kung mangarap tayong pagdating ng 2016, 10 milyong turista na ang bibisita sa Pilipinas kada taon. [\r\n] Kung patuloy na magkakaisa ang sambayanang Pilipino, gaya ng ipinamalas nating hirangin ang Puerto Princesa Underground River bilang isa sa New Seven Wonders of Nature, walang dudang makakamtan natin ito. Ang pahayag nga po natin sa daigdig: \u201cIt\u2019s more fun in the Philippines.\u201d [\r\n] Kahit wala pang isang taon sa puwesto si Secretary Mon Jimenez, nagagapas na natin ang positibong bunga ng ating mga naipunlang reporma. Masasabi nga po nating pagdating sa turismo, \u201cIt\u2019s really fun\u2014to have Secretary Mon Jimenez as our Secretary.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nKung paglago po ang usapan, nasa tuktok ng listahan ang agrikultura. Kayod-kalabaw po si Secretary Alcala upang makapaghatid ng mabubuting balita. [\r\n] Binisita po niya ang lahat ng probinsya hindi para mangampanya sa sarili pero para ikampanya ang programa ng Department of Agriculture. Dati, para bang ang pinapalago ng mga namumuno sa Department of Agriculture ay ang utang ng NFA [National Food Authority]. Twelve billion pesos ang minana nilang utang; ang ipinamana naman nila sa atin, 177 billion pesos.\r\nHindi po ba\u2019t noon, pinaniwala tayo na 1.3 million metric tons ang kakulangan sa bigas, at para tugunan ito, di bababa sa 2 million metric tons ang kanilang inangkat noong 2010. Parang unlimited rice sila kung maka-order ng bigas, pero dahil sobra-sobra, nabubulok lang naman ito sa mga bodega. Ang 1.3 million metric tons, unang taon pa lang, napababa na natin sa 860,000 metric tons. [\r\n] Ngayong taon, 500,000 na lang, kasama pa ang buffer sakaling abutin tayo ng bagyo. [\r\n] Huwag lang po tayong pagsungitan ng panahon, harinawa sa susunod na taon ay puwede na tayong mag-export ng bigas. [\r\n]\r\nAng sabi po ni Secretary Alcala: Ang susi dito, makatotohanang programa sa irigasyon at masigasig na implementasyon ng certified seeds program. [\r\n] Ang masakit po, hindi bagong kaalaman ito; hindi lang ipinapatupad. Kung dati pa sila nagtrabaho nang matino, nasaan na kaya tayo ngayon?\r\nTingnan rin po natin ang industriya ng niyog at ang cocowater na dati tinatapon lang, ngayon, napapakinabangan na ng magsasaka. Noong 2009, 483,862 liters ng cocowater ang iniluwas natin. Umangat po ito ng 1,807,583 liters noong 2010. Huwag po kayong magugulat, noong 2011, 16,756,498 liters [\r\n]\u2014puwede ho bang ulitin iyon?\u201416,756,498 liters ng cocowater ang in-export ng Pilipinas. Ang coco coir naman, kung dati walang pumapansin, ngayon may shortage na dahil pinapakyaw ng mga exporter. Hindi natin sasayangin ang pagkakataong ito. Bibili pa tayo ng mga bagong makinang magpoproseso ng bunot para makuha ang mga hiblang ginagawa mula sa coco coir. Sa susunod na taon, lalo nating mapapakinabangan ang industriya ng niyog. Naglaan na tayo ng 1.75 billion pesos upang mamuhunan at palaguin ito. [\r\n]\r\nSinimulan po ng aking ina ang Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Nararapat lamang na matapos ang programang ito sa panahon ng aking panunungkulan. [\r\n]\r\nIsinasaayos na po ang sistema upang mapabilis ang pagpapatupad ng repormang agraryo. Ginagawa ng pamahalaan ang lahat ng hakbang upang maipamahagi sa ating magsasaka ang mga lupaing diniligan at pinagyaman ng kanilang pawis. Subalit mayroon pa rin pong ayaw paawat sa pagtatanim ng mga balakid. Ang tugon ko sa kanila: Susunod tayo sa batas. Ang atas ng batas, ang atas ng taumbayan, at ang atas ko: Bago ako bumaba sa puwesto, naipamigay na dapat ang lahat ng lupaing sakop ng CARP. [\r\n]\r\nLiwanagin naman po natin ang nangyayari sa sektor ng enerhiya. Mantakin po ninyo: Dati po, umabot lang ang kawad ng kuryente sa barangay hall, \u201cenergized\u201d na raw ang buong barangay. Kaya ganoon na lang kung ipagmalaki nilang 99.98 percent na raw ng mga barangay sa bansa ang may kuryente. Pati ba naman sa serbisyong dapat ay matagal nang napapakinabangan ng Pilipino, nagkakagulangan pa? Kaya nga po, para subukan ang kakayahan ng DOE [Department of Energy] at NEA [National Electrification Administration], naglaan tayo ng 1.3 billion pesos para pailawan ang unang target na 1,300 sitios, sa presyong 1 milyong piso bawat isa. Nang matapos sila, ang napailawan sa inilaan nating pondo: 1,520 sitios, at gumastos lamang sila ng 814 million pesos. [\r\n] Nagawa nila ito sa loob lamang ng tatlong buwan, at mas marami pa pong gagawin sa taong ito hanggang maubos \u2018yang 36,000 na sitiong walang kuryente. Kay Secretary Rene Almendras, bilib talaga ako sa iyo; [\r\n] parang hindi ka nauubusan ng enerhiya. Sa paghahatid-serbisyo, hindi ka lang ever-ready, nagmistulang Energizer bunny ka pa\u2014you keep on going, and going, and going. [\r\n]\r\nNangingibabaw na nga po ang liwanag sa ating bayan\u2014liwanag na nagsiwalat sa krimeng nagaganap sa madidilim na sulok ng lipunan. Ang pinagsisikapang kitain ng Pilipino, hindi na magagantso. Patuloy po ang pagbaba ng crime volume sa buong bansa. Ang mahigit 500,000 krimen na naitala noong 2009, mahigit kalahati po ang nabawas: 246,958 na lamang iyan nitong 2011. Dagdag pa rito, ang dating 2,200 kaso ng carnapping noong 2010, lampas kalahati rin ang ibinaba; 966 na lang po iyan pagdating ng 2011.\r\nIto nga po sana ang dalhin ng ating mga headline. Hindi po natin sinasabing wala nang krimeng nagaganap, pero palagay ko naman po, wala dapat magalit na nangalahati na ito. Si Raymond Dominguez na matagal nang labas-masok sa kulungan, hindi ba\u2019t sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang taon, nasentensyahan at naipakulong na? Ang dalawa pa niyang kapatid ay sinampahan na rin natin ng kaso at kasalukuyan na ring nakabilanggo. May dalawang suspect sa bus bombing sa Makati noong nakaraang taon, ang isa po\u2019y pumanaw na; \u2018yung isa, humihimas na ng rehas. Kakosa niya ang mahigit 10,000 sangkot sa ilegal na droga na inaresto ng PDEA [Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency] nitong 2011. [\r\n]\r\nAlam po nating hindi araw-araw ang laban ni Pacman, at hindi puwedeng iasa dito ang pagbaba ng krimen. Kaya nga po pinalalakas natin ang puwersa ng kapulisan. Di po ba, nang dumating tayo, 45 porsyento ng ating kapulisan ang walang baril at umaasa sa anting-anting habang tumutugis ng masasamang-loob? [\r\n] Mayroon pong nanalo na sa bidding, tinitiyak na lamang nating dekalidad ang kanilang mga produkto. Pagkatapos ng proseso, at itong taon po nating inaasahan ito, maipagkakaloob na ang 74,600 na baril na magagamit nila upang ipagtanggol at alagaan ang bayan, lipunan, at sarili. [\r\n]\r\nDumako naman po tayo sa usapin ng pambansang tanggulan. May mga nagsabi na po na ang ating Air Force, \u201call air, at no force.\u201d [\r\n] Imbes na alagaan ng estado, para bang sinasadyang ilagay sa alanganin ang ating mga sundalo. Hindi po tayo makakapayag na manatiling ganito.\r\nMakalipas nga lang po ang isang taon at pitong buwan, nakapaglaan na tayo ng mahigit 28 bilyong piso para sa AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Modernization Program. Aabutan na nito ang 33 bilyong pisong pondo na ipinagkaloob sa nasabing programa sa nakalipas na 15 taon. [\r\n] Bumubuwelo pa lang po tayo sa lagay na \u2018yan. Kapag naipasa na ang panukala nating AFP modernization bill sa Kongreso, makakapaglaan tayo ng 75 bilyong piso para sa susunod na limang taon.\r\nKasado na rin po ang tatlumpung milyong dolyar na pondong kaloob ng Estados Unidos para sa Defense Capability Upgrade and Sustainment of Equipment Program ng AFP. Bukod pa po ito sa tulong nila upang pahusayin pa ang pagmanman sa ating mga baybayin sa ilalim ng itatayong Coast Watch Center ng Pilipinas.\r\nNagka-canvass na rin po ang Sandatahang Lakas ng mga kagamitan tulad ng mga kanyon, armored personnel carrier, at frigates. Hindi magtatagal, dadaong na ang karelyebo ng\r\nsa ating pampang. Sa Enero, aangkla na po sa Pilipinas ang BRP\r\n, ang pangalawa nating Hamilton class cutter. Di na po bangkang papel ang ating ipapalaot; [\r\n] ngayon, mga high-tech at dekalidad na barko na ang tatanod sa 36,000 kilometers nating coastline.\r\nMainam na rin po siguro kung maglilinis-linis na ng mga hangar ang ating Sandatahang Lakas, dahil darating na ang mga kagamitang lalong magpapatikas sa ating tanggulan. Sa wakas, may katuwang na po ang kaisa-isa nating C-130 na 36 na taon nang rumoronda sa himpapawid. Dalawa pang C-130 ang magiging operational ulit sa taong ito. Bago matapos ang taong ito, inaasahan nating maide-deliver na ang binili nating 21 refurbished UH-1H Helicopter, 4 na combat utility helicopters, mga radyo\u2019t iba pang communication equipment, rifles, mortars, mobile diagnostic laboratories, kasama na ang bullet station assembly para sa arsenal. [\r\n] Pagdating naman po ng 2013, lalapag na ang 10 attack helicopters, 2 naval helicopters, 2 light lift aircraft, 1 frigate, at mga force protection equipment. [\r\n]\r\nAt hindi lang po natin sa armas ipinaparamdam ang pagkalinga sa ating pulis at kasundaluhan. Nabawasan na rin po ang mga pasanin nila sa pamumuhay dahil sa mahigit 22,000 bahay ang naipatayo na sa ilalim ng AFP\u2013PNP housing program. [\r\n]\r\nHindi po ito tungkol sa pakikipaggirian o pakikipagmatigasan. Hindi ito tungkol sa pagsisiga-sigaan. Tungkol ito sa pagkamit ng kapayapaan. Tungkol ito sa kakayahan nating ipagtanggol ang ating sarili\u2014isang bagay na kay tagal nating inisip na imposible. Tungkol po ito sa buhay ng isang sundalong araw-araw sumasabak sa peligro; tungkol ito sa pamilya niyang nag-aabang na makabalik siyang ligtas, ano man ang kanyang makaharap. Hayaan nating ang ilang mga benipisyaryo ang magsabi sa pagbabago ng buhay po nila:\r\n[Video starts]\r\n\u201cNagpapasalamat sa Poong Maykapal. Binigyan kami ng ganitong pagkakataon\u2014binigyan ng blessing na ganito. Pangalawa, \u2018yung pagkakaroon natin ng mabait na pangulo. Itong proyekto na ito ay hindi niya kami pinababayaan\u2014mga kapulisan at mga sundalo\u2014sandatahan ng ating Pilipinas.\u201d\r\n\u201cKinakaya namin, ma\u2019am. Pero ginagawan ko talaga ng paraan na makapasok sila [sa eskuwela]. \u2018Yun lang talaga, ma\u2019am, ang misyon ko sa buhay na mapaaral sila, maibigay ko \u2018yung tamang edukasyon, na hindi maging gusgusin ang anak ko, hindi kaawa-awa[an] ng mga tao, may magulang na dapat magtaguyod. At nagpapasalamat ako sa Pantawid [Pamilya Program], ma\u2019am, dahil may natutunan ako ditong malaki.\u201d\r\n\u201cMalaking tulong na isa kami\u2014ang alam ko kauna-unahan na nakinabang at nakikinabang pa sa package na \u2018to na Category Z Package ng PhilHealth. Nagpapasalamat kami nang sobra at hindi man maganda na nagkaroon ng sakit ang anak ko, pero mayroong PhilHealth na tutulong at handang tumulong sa mga gastusin namin.\u201d\r\n\u201cNoong araw na nasama ako sa isang Oakwood Mutiny\u2014\u2018yung pinaglalaban namin, ito na po \u2018yung hinihintay namin para sa pagbabago at ito na po ang pagkakataon natin para magkaroon tayo ng sariling bahay lalung-lalo na sa programa ng ating presidente na si Benigno Aquino III.\u201d\r\n[Video ends]\r\nAt ngayon ngang inaaruga na sila ng taumbayan, lalo namang ginaganahan ang ating kasundaluhan na makamtan ang kapayapaan. Tagumpay pong maituturing ang 203 rebeldeng sumuko at nagbabalik-loob na sa lipunan, at ang 1,772 na bandidong nawakasan na ang karahasan. Halimbawa po, ang kilabot na teroristang si Doctor Abu, na hindi na makakapaghasik ng kaniyang lagim. Nagpupugay rin po tayo sa panunumbalik sa katahimikan sa mga lugar na matagal nang biningi ng putukan. Ang resulta nga po ng bayanihan: 365 na barangay ang naagaw sa kamay ng kaaway, 270 na gusali\u2019t paaralan ang naipaayos, at 74 health centers ang naipagawa. [\r\n]\r\nKung kapayapaan na lang din po ang usapan, dumako naman tayo sa lugar na matagal naging mukha ng mga mithiing di makamtan-kamtan. Bago po magsimula ang mga reporma natin sa ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao], at alam naman po n\u2019yo, may mga ghost students doon, na naglalakad sa isang ghost road, tungo sa isang ghost school, para magpaturo sa isang ghost teacher. Ang mga aparisyon pong gumulantang kay OIC Governor Mujiv Hataman: [\r\n] Apat na eskuwelahan na natagpuang may ghost students; iniimbestigahan na rin ang mga teacher na hindi lumilitaw ang pangalan sa talaan ng Professional Regulation Commission, gayundin ang mga tauhan ng gobyernong hindi nakalista sa plantilya. Limampu\u2019t limang ghost entry ang tinanggal sa payroll. Ang dating paulit-ulit na pagsasaboy ng graba sa kalsada para lang pagkakitaan ng pera, bawal na. Wala nang cash advance sa mga ahensya, para maiwasan ang pagsasamantala. Ang mga multo sa voters list, mapapatahimik na ang kaluluwa. [\r\n] Kaya nga po kay OIC Gov. Mujiv Hataman, ang masasabi natin: talaga namang isa ka nang certified ghost buster. [\r\n]\r\nAng pumalit po, at pinapalit na: pabahay, tulay, at learning center para sa mga Badjao sa Basilan. Mga community-based hatchery, lambat, materyales para maglinang ng seaweeds, at punlang napakinabangan ng 2,588 na mangingisda. Certified seeds, punla ng gabi, cassava, goma, at mga punong namumunga para sa 145,121 na magsasaka. Simula pa lang po iyan; nakalaan na ang 183 million pesos para sa mga municipal fishing port projects sa ARMM; 310.4 million pesos para sa mga istasyon ng bumbero; 515 million pesos para sa malinis na inuming tubig; 551.9 million pesos para sa mga kagamitang pangkalusugan; 691.9 million pesos para sa day care centers; at 2.85 billion pesos para sa mga kalsada at tulay na babagtas sa rehiyon. Ilan lang po iyan sa patutunguhan ng kabuuang 8.59 billion pesos na ipinagkaloob ng pambansang gobyerno para isakatuparan ang mga reporma sa ARMM. [\r\n] Lilinawin ko rin po, hindi pa kasama rito ang taunang suportang natatanggap nila, na ngayong 2012 ay umabot sa 11.7 billion pesos. [\r\n]\r\nMaski po ang mga dating gustong tumiwalag, nakikita na ang epekto ng reporma. Kinikilala natin bilang pahiwatig ng kanilang tiwala ang nakaraang pitong buwan, kung kailan walang nangyaring sagupaan sa pagitan ng militar at ng MILF [Moro Islamic Liberation Front]. Sa peace process naman po, hayag at lantaran ang usapan. Nagpapamalas ang magkabilang panig ng tiwala sa isa\u2019t isa. Maaaring minsan, magiging masalimuot ang proseso; signos lang po ito na malapit na nating makamit ang nag-iisa nating mithiin: kapayapaan.\r\nMapayapang pag-uusap rin po ang prinsipyong isinulong natin upang mabuo ang ating Executive Order ukol sa pagmimina. Ang kaisipan sa likod ng nabuong consensus: mapakinabangan ang ating likas na yaman upang iangat ang buhay ng Pilipino, hindi lamang ngayon kundi pati na rin sa susunod na salinlahi. Hindi natin pipitasin ang ginintuang bunga ng industriyang ito, kung ang magiging kabayaran ay ang pagkasira ng kalikasan. [\r\n]\r\nNgunit unang hakbang lamang ito. Isipin po ninyo, noong 2010, 145 billion pesos ang kabuuang halaga na nakuha mula sa pagmimina, subalit 13.4 billion pesos lamang o 9 porsyento ang napunta sa kaban ng bayan. Ang likas na yaman, pag-aari ninyo; hindi tayo papayag na balato lang ang mapupunta sa Pilipino. Umaasa po tayo sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso upang makapagpasa ng batas na sisigurong napapangalagaan ang kalikasan at matitiyak na makatarungan ang magiging pakinabang ng publiko at pribadong sektor sa mga biyayang makukuha natin mula sa industriyang ito. [\r\n]\r\nPag-usapan po natin ang situwasyon sa Disaster Risk Reduction and Management. Dati, ang gobyernong dapat tumutulong, nanghihingi rin ng tulong. Ngayon, nasa Pasipiko pa lang ang bagyo, alam na kung saan idedestino ang ayuda, at may malinaw nang plano upang maiwasan ang peligro.\r\nTuwing pag-uusapan nga po ang sakuna, lagi kong naaalala ang nangyari po sa amin sa Tarlac noong minsang bumagyo. Sa lakas ng ulan, bumigay ang isang dike. Nang nagising ang atin pong barangay captain, tinangay na ng baha ang kanyang bahay at mga kagamitang pangsaka. Buti nga po\u2019t nailigtas ang buong mag-anak. Malas lang po ng kalabaw nilang naiwang nakatali sa puno; nabigti ito sa lakas ng ragasa.\r\nWalang kalaban-laban din po ang marami sa tinamaan ng bagyong Ondoy, Pepeng, at Sendong. Napakarami pong nasawi sa paghagupit ng mga delubyong ito. Sa ilalim ng bagong-lunsad na\r\n, isinakay natin sa iisang bangka ang mga inisyatiba kontra-sakuna, at hindi na rin po idinadaan sa tsamba ang paglilikas sa mga pamilya. Gamit ang teknolohiya, nabibigyan na ng wastong babala ang Pilipino upang makapaghanda at makaiwas sa disgrasya.\r\nReal-time at direkta na ang pakinabang ng 86 na automated rain gauges at 28 water level monitoring sensors natin sa iba\u2019t ibang rehiyon. Bago matapos ang 2013, ang target natin: 600 automated rain gauges at 422 water level sensors. Ipapakabit po natin ang mga ito sa 18 pangunahing river basins sa buong bansa. [\r\n]\r\nIsa pa pong pagbabago: Dati, ang mga ahensya\u2019y kanya-kanyang habulan ng numero, kanya-kanyang agenda, kanya-kanyang pasikatan. Ngayon, ang kultura sa gobyerno: bayanihan para sa kapakanan ng taumbayan. Convergence po ang tawag natin dito.\r\nDati pa naman po naglipana ang mga programa sa tree planting. Pero matapos magtanim, pababayaan na lang ang mga ito. Kapag nakita ng mga komunidad na naghahanap din ng kabuhayan, puputulin ang mga ito para gawing uling.\r\nMay solusyon na po rito. Mayroon na pong 128,558 hectares ng kagubatang naitanim sa buong bansa; bahagi lang po iyan ng kabuuang 1.5 million na ektaryang matatamnan bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. [\r\n] Nakapaloob po rito ang mga komunidad na nasa ilalim ng\r\n. Ang proseso: pagkatanim ng puno, makikipag-ugnayan ang DSWD sa mga komunidad. Kapalit ng conditional cash transfer, aalagaan ang mga puno; mayroon ding mga magpapalago ng bagong punla sa nursery. Three hundred thirty-five thousand and seventy-eight na po ang mga Pilipinong nakakakuha ng kabuhayan mula dito.\r\nSa isa nga pong programa, nakiambag din ang pribadong sektor, na nagbibigay ng espesyal na binhi ng kape at cacao sa komunidad, at tinuturuan silang alagaan at siguruhing mataas ang ani. Itinatanim ang kape sa ilalim ng mga puno, na habang nakatayo ay masisigurong hihigop ng baha at tutulong makaiwas tayo sa pinsala. Ang kumpanyang nagbigay ng binhi, sure buyer na rin ng ani. Panalo po ang mga komunidad na may dagdag kita, panalo ang pribadong sektor, panalo pa ang susunod na salinlahing makikinabang sa matatayog na puno. [\r\n]\r\nMatagal na pong problema ang illegal logging. Mula nga po nang lumapag ang\r\n, nakasabat na si Mayor Jun Amante ng mahigit 6 milyong pisong halaga ng troso. Nagpapasalamat tayo sa kanya. Sa Butuan pa lang ito; paano pa kung magpapakita ng ganitong political will ang lahat ng mga LGU [local government unit]?\r\nAng mga trosong nakukumpiska ng DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources], lalapag sa mga komunidad na naturuan na ng TESDA ng pagkakarpintero. Ang resulta: upuan para sa mga pampublikong paaralan na hawak naman ng DepEd. Isipin po ninyo, ang dating pinagmumulan ng pinsala, ngayon, tulay na para sa mas mabuting kinabukasan. Dati, imposible nga ito; imposible kung nagbubulag-bulagan ang pamahalaan sa ilegal na gawain.\r\nKaya kayong mga walang konsensya; kayong mga paulit-ulit isinusugal ang buhay ng kapwa Pilipino: maghanda na kayo. Tapos na ang maliligayang araw po ninyo. [\r\n] Sinampolan na natin ang 34 na kawani ng DENR, 1 PNP provincial director, at 7 chiefs of police. Pinagpapaliwanag na rin po natin ang isang regional director ng PNP na nagbingi-bingihan sa aking utos at nagbulag-bulagan sa mga dambuhalang trosong dumaan sa kanilang tanawin. Kung hindi kayo umayos, isusunod namin kayo. Magkubli man kayo sa ilalim ng inyong mga padrino, aabutan namin kayo. Isasama na rin namin ang mga padrino ninyo. [\r\n] Kaya bago pa magkasalubong ang ating landas, ako po\u2019y muling makikiusap, mas maganda sigurong tumino na kayo.\r\nMula sa sinapupunan, sa pag-aaral, at sa pagtatrabaho, may pagbabago nang haharap sa Pilipino. At sakaling piliin niyang magserbisyo sa gobyerno, tuloy pa rin ang pag-aaruga ng estado hanggang sa kanyang pagreretiro. Tatanawin ng pamahalaan ang kanyang ambag bilang lingkod-bayan, at hindi ipagdadamot sa kanya ang pensiyong siya rin naman ang nagpuhunan.\r\nIsipin po ninyo, at ako po\u2019y nagulat dito: may mga pensyonado tayong tumatanggap ng 500 pesos lamang kada buwan. Paano kaya niya ito pagkakasiyahin sa tubig, kuryente, at pagkain araw-araw? Ang atin pong tugon: Pagsapit ng bagong taon, hindi na bababa sa 5,000 piso ang matatanggap na buwanang pensyon ng ating old-age and disability pensioners. [\r\n] Masaya tayong matutugunan natin ang pangangailangan nila ngayon, nang hindi isinusugal ang kapakanan ng mga pensyonado bukas.\r\nIba na po talaga ang mukha ng gobyerno. Sumasabay na po sa pribadong sektor ang ating pasahod para sa entry level. Pero kapag sabay kayong na-promote ng kaklase mong piniling mag-pribado, nagkakaiwanan na.\r\nMahahabol din po natin iyan; pero sa ngayon po, ang good news natin sa mga nagtatrabaho sa pamahalaan:\r\n. Dati, maski palpak ang palakad ng isang ahensya, very satisfactory pa rin ang pinakamababang rating ng empleyado. Dahil sa pakikisama, nahihirapan ang bisor na bigyan ng makatarungang rating ang mga tauhan niya. Nakakawawa tuloy ang mga mahusay magtrabaho. Nawawalan sila ng dahilan para galingan dahil parehas lang naman ang insentibo ng mga tamad at pursigido.\r\nHeto po ang isa lamang sa mga hakbang natin upang tugunan ito. Simula ngayong taon, magpapatupad tayo ng sistema kung saan ang bonus ay nakabase sa pagtupad ng mga ahensya sa kanilang mga target para sa taon. [\r\n] Nasa kamay na ng empleyado ang susi sa kanyang pag-angat. Ang insentibo, maaaring umabot ng 35,000 piso, depende sa pagpapakitang-gilas mo sa iyong trabaho. Dagdag pa ito sa across-the-board na Christmas bonus na matatanggap mo.\r\nGinagawa natin ito, hindi lamang para itaas ang kumpiyansa at ipakita ang pagtitiwala natin sa ating mga lingkod-bayan. Higit sa lahat, para ito sa Pilipinong umaasa sa tapat at mahusay na serbisyo mula sa lingkod-bayan, at umaasang sila at sila lamang ang itinuturing na boss ng kanilang pamahalaan. [\r\n]\r\nAlam po niyo, sa simula pa lang mayroon nang mga kumukuwestiyon sa sinasabi nating, \u201cKung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.\u201d Hanggang ngayon mayroon pa rin pong mangilan-ngilang nagtatanong: Nakakain ba ang mabuting pamamahala? Ang simpleng sagot, \u201cSiyempre.\u201d\r\nIsipin po natin ang ating pinanggalingan: Dati, parang \u201cWild West\u201d ang pamumuhunan sa Pilipinas. May peligro na nga ang negosyo, sinagad pa ang risko dahil sa di tiyak at nakalihim na patakaran. Kakamayan ka gamit ang kanan, kokotongan ka naman na gamit ang kaliwa.\r\nNgayon, dahil patas na ang laban, at may hayag at hindi pabagu-bagong mga patakaran, patuloy ang pagtaas ng kumpiyansa sa ating ekonomiya. Patuloy ang pagpasok ng puhunan; patuloy ang pagdami ng trabaho; patuloy ang positibong siklo ng pagkonsumo, paglago ng negosyo, at pagdami ng mamamayang naeempleyo. [\r\n]\r\nDahil maayos ang paggugol ng gobyerno, walang tagas sa sistema. Dahil maayos ang pangkolekta ng buwis, lumalago ang kaban ng bayan. Bawat pisong nakokolekta, tiyak ang pupuntahan: Piso itong diretso sa kalsada, piso para sa bakuna, piso para sa classroom at upuan, piso para sa ating kinabukasan. [\r\n]\r\nDahil maayos ang paggawa ng tulay, kalsada, at gusali, itinatayo ang mga ito kung saan kailangan. Maayos ang daanan, mas mabilis ang takbo ng produkto, serbisyo, at mamamayan.\r\nDahil maayos ang pamamahala sa agrikultura, tumataas ang produksyon ng pagkain, at hindi pumapalo ang presyo nito. Stable ang pasahod, at mas malakas ang pambansang ekonomiya.\r\nTunay nga po, ang matatag at malakas na ekonomiyang pinanday ng mabuting pamamahala ang pinakamabisang kalasag laban sa mga hamon na kinakaharap ng daigdig. Dalawang taon po nating binaklas ang mga balakid sa pag-unlad, at ngayon, tayo na lang mismo ang makakapigil sa ating sariling pag-angat.\r\nGinawa po natin ang lahat ng ito habang binubuno rin ng bawat bansa sa iba\u2019t ibang sulok ng daigdig ang kani-kanilang problema\u2019t pagsubok.\r\nHindi po tayo nag-iisa sa mundo, kaya\u2019t habang tinutugunan natin ang sarili nating mga suliranin, angkop lamang na bantayan din ang ilang pangyayaring maaaring makaapekto sa atin.\r\nNaging maugong ang mga kaganapan sa Bajo de Masinloc. May mga mangingisdang Tsinong pumasok sa ating teritoryo. Nasabat ng barko natin at nasabat sa kanilang mga barko ang endangered species. Bilang pinuno, kailangan kong ipatupad ang batas na umiiral sa ating bansa. Sa pagsulong nito, nagbungguan ang Nine-Dash Line Theory ng mga Tsino, na umaangkin sa halos buong West Philippine Sea, at ang karapatan natin at ng marami pang ibang bansa, kasama na ang Tsina, na pinagtibay naman ng United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea.\r\nIbayong hinahon ang ipinamalas natin. Ang barko ng Hukbong Dagat, bilang tanda ng ating malinis na hangarin, ay agad nating pinalitan ng barkong sibilyan. Hindi tayo nakipagsagutan sa mga banat ng kanilang media sa atin. Hindi naman po siguro kalabisan na hilingin sa kabilang panig na galangin ang ating karapatan, gaya ng paggalang sa kanilang mga karapatan bilang kapwa bansang nasa iisang mundong kailangang pagsaluhan.\r\nMayroon po tayong mga miron na nagsasabing hayaan na lang ang Bajo de Masinloc; umiwas na lang tayo. Pero kung may pumasok sa inyong bakuran at sinabing sa kanya na ang kanyang kinatatayuan ay sa kanya na, papayag ba kayo? Hindi naman po yata tamang ipamigay na lang natin sa iba ang sadyang atin talaga. [\r\n]\r\nKaya nga po hinihiling ko sa sambayanan ang pakikiisa sa isyung ito. Iisa lang po dapat ang kumpas natin. Tulungan ninyo akong iparinig sa kabilang panig ang katuwiran ng ating mga paninindigan.\r\nHindi po simple ang sitwasyon, at hindi magiging simple ang solusyon. Magtiwala po kayo, kumukonsulta tayo sa mga eksperto, at sa lahat ng pinuno ng ating bansa, pati na sa mga kaalyado natin\u2014gayundin sa mga nasa kabilang panig ng usaping ito\u2014upang makahanap ng solusyon na katanggap-tanggap sa lahat. [\r\n]\r\nSa bawat hakbang sa tuwid na daan, nagpunla tayo ng pagbabago. Ngunit may mangilan-ngilan pa ring pilit na bubunot nito. Habang nagtatalumpati ako ngayon, may mga nagbubulung-bulungan sa isang silid at hinihimay ang aking mga sinasabi; naghahanap ng butas na ipambabatikos bukas. Sasabihin nila, \u201cSalita lang ito, at hindi totoo ang tuwid na landas.\u201d Sila rin po ang magsasabing hayaan na, magkaisa na; forgive and forget na lang para makausad na tayo.\r\nHindi ko po matatanggap ito. Forgive and forget na lang ang 10 taon na nawala sa atin? Forgive and forget na lang para sa magsasakang nabaon sa utang dahil sa kakaangkat natin ng bigas, gayong puwede naman palang pagyamanin ang ating sariling lupa?\r\nForgive and forget na lang ba para sa pamilya ng isang pulis na namatay nang walang kalaban-laban, dahil batuta lang ang hawak niya habang hinahabol ang armadong masasamang-loob?\r\nForgive and forget na lang ba para sa mga naulila ng 57 biktima ng masaker sa Maguindanao? Maibabalik ba sila ng \u201cforgive and forget?\u201d [\r\n] Forgive and forget ang lahat ng atraso ng mga naglubog sa atin sa bulok na estado? Forgive and forget para maibalik ang lumang status quo? Ang tugon ko, \u201cAng magpatawad, maaari; ang makalimot, hindi.\u201d [\r\n] Kung ang nagkasala ay hindi mananagot, gagarantiyahan mo ang pagpapahirap muli sa sambayanan.\r\nAng tunay na pagkakaisa at pagkakasunduan ay magmumula lamang sa tunay at ganap na katarungan. Katarungan ang tawag sa plunder case na isinampa laban sa dating pangulo. [\r\n] Katarungan na bigyan siya ng pagkakataong harapin ang mga akusasyon at ipagtanggol ang kanyang sarili. Katarungan ang nasaksihan natin noong 29 ng Mayo. Noong araw na iyon, pinatunayan natin: Posibleng mangibabaw ang katarungan kahit na ang kabangga mo ay may mataas na katungkulan. [\r\n] Noong araw na iyon, may isang Delsa Flores sa Panabo, Davao del Norte, na nagsabing, \u201cPosible palang iisang batas lang ang kailangang sundin ng court interpreter na tulad ko, at ng Punong Mahistrado.\u201d [\r\n] \u00a0Posible palang maging patas ang timbangan; maaaring isakdal at panagutin maski ang mayaman at makapangyarihan.\r\nKaya po sa susunod na magiging Punong Mahistrado, malaki ang inaasahan sa inyo ng sambayanan. Napatunayan na po nating posible ang imposible; ang trabaho natin ngayon, siguruhing magpapatuloy ang pagbabago tungo sa tunay na katarungan, matapos man ang ating termino. [\r\n] Marami pong sira sa sistemang kailangan ninyong kumpunihin, at alam kong hindi magiging madali ito. Alam ko po kung gaano kabigat ang pasanin ng isang malinaw na mandato; ngunit ito ang atas sa atin ng taumbayan; ito ang tungkuling ating sinumpaan; ito ang kailangan nating gampanan.\r\nSimple lang ang hangad natin: Kung inosente ka, buong-loob kang haharap sa korte, dahil kampante kang mapapawalang-sala ka. Kung ikaw ang salarin, anuman ang apelyido mo, o gaano man karami ang titulong nakakabit sa iyong pangalan, may katiyakan din na pananagutan mo ang ginawa mong kasalanan. [\r\n]\r\nSalamat din po kay Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, [\r\n] sa pagtanggap ng hamon na maging tunay na tanod-bayan. Kung tutuusin, puwede na niyang tanggihan ang responsibilidad at sabihing, \u201cRetirado na ako, puwede bang \u2018yung iba na lang?\u201d Subalit nangibabaw ang kaniyang malasakit sa bayan. Sa kabila nito, may nagregalo pa rin sa kanya ng granada sa bahay. [\r\n] Ma\u2019am, may mga darating pa pong pagsubok; baka po paglaon, magaya na kayo sa akin na tinatawag, sabay-sabay pang tinatawag, na ganid na kapitalistang kakuntsaba o komunista din patungong diktador dahil sa masigasig na mga repormang ipinapatupad natin.\r\nBilib po ako sa inyong pagpapakitang-gilas at maraming salamat sa pagiging instrumento ng katarungan, lalo na noong kasagsagan ng impeachment trial. [\r\n] Salamat din po sa dalawang institusyong bumubuo ng Kongreso: Sa Senado at Kamara de Representante, na tinimbang ng taumbayan at nakitang sapat na sapat.\r\nSa lahat po ng tumulong sa pagpapagana ng mga prosesong pangkatarungan: Dumaan kayo sa matinding pagsubok, batikos, at agam-agam; kasama pa ang kaba na kung natalo kayo, kayo ang unang pupuntiryahin ng kalaban. Pero di kayo natinag. Umasa sa inyo ang Pilipino, at pinatunayan ninyong tama ang pag-asa sa inyo. Hindi ninyo binigo ang sambayanan; pinaliwanag ninyo lalo ang ating kinabukasan. [\r\n]\r\nPaalala lang po: Hindi natatapos ang laban sa isang tiwaling opisyal na natanggal sa puwesto, sa isang maanomalyang kontratang napigil ipatupad, o sa isang opisinang naituwid ang pamamalakad. Kaya naman nananawagan po tayo sa Kongreso na ipasa ang panukala nating sa pag-amyenda sa Anti-Money Laundering Act, upang mas mapaigting pa natin ang pagpapanagot sa mga tiwali.\r\nItong tinatamasa natin ngayon: ang bawat nailawan at iilawan pang sitio; ang bawat daan, tulay, paliparan, tren, at daungan; ang bawat kontratang walang bukol; ang kaligtasan at kapayapaan mula lungsod hanggang nayon; ang pagbalik ng piring sa sistemang pangkatarungan; ang bawat classroom, upuan, at aklat na napasakamay ng kabataan; ang bawat Pilipinong nahahandugan ng bagong kinabukasan\u2014ang lahat ng ito, naabot natin sa loob lamang ng dalawang taon.\r\nPagtabihin po natin ang dalawang taon na ito, at ang nakaraang siyam at kalahating taon na ating pinagdusahan. Di po ba\u2019t sumusulong na ang agenda ng pagbabago? Ang kapareho namin ng adhikain, malamang, kasama namin sa agendang ito. At kung kontra ka sa amin, siguro kontra ka rin sa ginagawa namin. Kung kumukontra sila sa agenda ng pagbabago, masasabi ba niyang sila\u2019y nasa panig ninyo?\r\nPaparating na naman po ang halalan. Kayo po, ang aming mga boss, ang tangi naming susundan. Ang tanong ko sa inyo, \u201cBoss, saan tayo tatahak? Tuloy ba ang biyahe natin sa tuwid na landas, o magmamaneobra ba tayo paatras, pabalik sa daan na baluktot at walang patutunguhan?\u201d\r\nNaalala ko pa po noong nagsimula tayo. Mulat na mulat ako sa bigat ng pasaning sasalubong sa atin. Kabilang ako sa mga nag-isip: Kaya pa bang ituwid ang ganito kabaluktot na sistema?\r\nHeto po ang aking natutuhan sa 25 buwan ng pagkapinuno: Walang pong imposible. [\r\n] Walang imposible dahil kung nakikita ng taumbayan na sila ang tanging boss ng kanilang pamahalaan, bubuhatin ka nila, gagabayan ka nila, sila mismo ang mamumuno tungo sa makabuluhang pagbabago. Hindi imposible na ang Pilipinas ang maging kauna-unahang bansa sa Timog-Silangang Asya na magbibigay at nagbibigay ng libreng bakuna laban sa rotavirus. Hindi imposible para sa Pilipinas na tumindig at sabihing, \u201cAng Pilipinas ay sa Pilipino\u2014at handa kaming ipagtanggol ito.\u201d Hindi imposible na ang Pilipinong kay tagal nang yumuyuko tuwing may nakakasalubong na dayuhan\u2014ang Pilipino ngayon, taas-noong tinitingala ng buong mundo. [\r\n] Talaga naman pong ang sarap maging Pilipino sa mga panahong ito.\r\nNoon pong nakaraang taon, hiniling ko sa taumbayan, magpasalamat sa mga nakikiambag sa positibong pagbabago sa lipunan. Hindi po biro ang mga pagsubok na dinaanan natin, kaya angkop lamang na pasalamatan ang mga taong nakibalikat, sa pagkukumpuni sa mga maling idinulot ng masamang pamamahala.\r\nSa lahat ng miyembro ng aking Gabinete: Maraming, maraming salamat. [\r\n] Mapalad po ang sambayanan at may mga tulad ninyong handang isuko ang pribado at mas tahimik na pamumuhay para maghatid ng serbisyo-publiko, kahit pa batid ninyong ang kapalit nito ay mas maliit na sweldo, panganib, at pambabatikos. Kaya maraming salamat muli.\r\nHuwag din po sana nilang masamain dahil personal ko silang pangangalanan: Kina Father Catalino Arevalo at Sister Agnes Guillen, na dumidilig at nagpapalago sa aking buhay spirituwal, lalo na sa mga panahong sukdulan ang pagsubok sa amin, maraming, maraming salamat din po. [\r\n]\r\nIto po ang aking ikatlong SONA, tatlo na lamang din po ang natitira. Papasok na po tayo sa kalagitnaan ng ating liderato. Noong nakaraang taon, ang hamon ko sa inyo: Iwaksi ang kultura ng negatibismo; sa bawat pagkakataon, iangat ang kapwa-Pilipino.\r\nBatid po sa tinatamasa natin ngayon: Hindi kayo nabigo. Sa inyo nagmula ang pagbabago. Ang sabi ninyo: Posible.\r\nHumaharap po ako sa inyo bilang mukha ng isang gobyernong kayo ang boss at kayo pa rin ang lakas. Inuulat ko lamang ang mga pagbabagong ginawa ninyong posible.\r\nKaya nga po sa lahat ng nurse, midwife, o doktor na piniling magsilbi sa mga baryo; sa bawat bagong graduate na piniling magtrabaho sa gobyerno; sa bawat atletang Pilipinong bitbit ang watawat saan mang panig ng mundo; sa bawat kawani ng pamahalaan na tapat na nagseserbisyo: Kayo po ang gumawa ng pagbabago. [\r\n]\r\nSa tuwing haharap ako sa isang ina na nagsasabing, \u201cSalamat at nabakunahan na ang aking sanggol,\u201d ang tugon ko: \u201cIkaw ang gumawa nito.\u201d\r\nSa tuwing haharap ako sa isang bata na nagsasabing, \u201cSalamat sa papel at lapis, sa pagkakataong makapag-aral,\u201d ang tugon ko: \u201cKasama ka sa gumawa nito.\u201d\r\nSa tuwing haharap ako sa isang OFW na nagsasabing, \u201cSalamat at puwede ko na muling pangaraping tumanda sa Pilipinas,\u201d ang tugon ko: \u201cIkaw ang gumawa nito.\u201d\r\nSa tuwing haharap ako sa isang Pilipinong nagsasabing, \u201cSalamat, akala ko hindi na magkakakuryente sa aming sitio. Akala ko hindi ko na aabuting buhay ang liwanag na ganito,\u201d ang tugon ko: \u201cIkaw ang gumawa nito.\u201d\r\nSa bawat pagkakataon na haharap ako sa isang magsasaka, guro, piloto, inhinyero, tsuper, ahente sa call center, karaniwang Pilipino; sa bawat Juan at Juana dela Cruz na nagsasabing \u201cSalamat sa pagbabago,\u201d ang tugon ko sa inyo: \u201cKayo ang gumawa nito.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nInuulit ko po, posible na ang dating imposible. Humaharap po ako sa inyo ngayon, at sinasabing, \u201cHindi ko SONA ito. Kayo ang gumawa nito. SONA ito ng sambayanang Pilipino.\u201d Maraming, maraming salamat po at magandang hapon po sa lahat.

{"delivered": "2010-07-26 19:41:46+00:00", "author": "Benigno S. Aquino III", "text": "Maraming salamat po. Maupo po tayong lahat.\r\nSpeaker Feliciano Belmonte; Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile; Vice President Jejomar C. Binay; Chief Justice Renato Corona; Former Presidents Fidel Valdez Ramos and Joseph Ejercito Estrada; members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; distinguished members of the diplomatic corps; my fellow workers in government;\r\nMga minamahal kong kababayan:\r\nSa bawat sandali po ng pamamahala ay nahaharap tayo sa isang sangandaan.\r\nSa isang banda po ay ang pagpili para sa ikabubuti ng taumbayan. Ang pagtanaw sa interes ng nakakarami; ang pagkapit sa prinsipyo; at ang pagiging tapat sa sinumpaan nating tungkulin bilang lingkod-bayan. Ito po ang tuwid na daan.\r\nSa kabilang banda ay ang pag-una sa pansariling interes. Ang pagpapaalipin sa pulitikal na konsiderasyon, at pagsasakripisyo ng kapakanan ng taumbayan. Ito po ang baluktot na daan.\r\nMatagal pong naligaw ang pamahalaan sa daang baluktot. Araw-araw po, lalong lumilinaw sa akin ang lawak ng problemang ating namana. Damang-dama ko ang bigat ng aking responsibilidad.\r\nSa unang tatlong linggo ng aming panunungkulan, marami po kaming natuklasan. Nais ko pong ipahayag sa inyo ang iilan lamang sa mga namana nating suliranin at ang ginagawa naming hakbang para lutasin ang mga ito.\r\nSulyap lamang po ito; hindi pa ito ang lahat ng problemang haharapin natin. Inilihim at sadyang iniligaw ang sambayanan sa totoong kalagayan ng ating bansa.\r\nSa unang anim na buwan ng taon, mas malaki ang ginastos ng gobyerno kaysa sa pumasok na kita. Lalong lumaki ang deficit natin, na umakyat na sa 196.7 billion pesos. Sa target na kuleksyon, kinapos tayo ng 23.8 billion pesos; ang tinataya namang gastos, nalagpasan natin ng 45.1 billion pesos.\r\nAng budget po sa 2010 ay 1.54 trillion pesos.\r\nNasa 100 bilyong piso o 6.5 porsyento na lang ng kabuuan ang malaya nating magagamit para sa nalalabing anim na buwan ng taong ito.\r\nHalos 1 porsyento na lang po ng kabuuang budget ang natitira para sa bawat buwan.\r\nSaan naman po dinala ang pera?\r\nNaglaan ng 2 bilyong piso na Calamity Fund bilang paghahanda para sa mga kalamidad na hindi pa nangyayari. Napakaliit na nga po ng pondong ito, ngunit kapapasok pa lang natin sa panahon ng baha at bagyo, 1.4 billion pesos o 70 porsyento na ang nagastos.\r\nSa kabuuan ng 108 million pesos para sa lalawigan ng Pampanga, 105 million pesos nito ay napunta sa iisang distrito lamang. Samantala, ang lalawigan ng Pangasinan na sinalanta ng Pepeng ay nakatanggap ng 5 milyong piso lamang para sa pinsalang idinulot ng bagyong Cosme, na nangyari noong 2008 pa.\r\nIbinigay po ang pondo ng Pampanga sa buwan ng eleksyon, pitong buwan pagkatapos ng Ondoy at Pepeng. Paano kung bumagyo bukas? Inubos na ang pondo nito para sa bagyong nangyari noong isang taon pa. Pagbabayaran ng kinabukasan ang kasakiman ng nakaraan.\r\nGanyan din po ang nangyari sa pondo ng MWSS [Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]. Kamakailan lamang, pumipila ang mga tao para lang makakuha ng tubig. Sa kabila nito, minabuti pa ng liderato ng MWSS na magbigay ng gantimpala sa sarili kahit hindi pa nababayaran ang pensyon ng mga retiradong empleyado.\r\nNoong 2009, ang buong payroll ng MWSS ay 51.4 million pesos. Pero hindi lang naman po ito ang sahod nila; may mga additional allowances at benefits pa sila na aabot sa 160.1 million pesos. Sa madaling sabi, nakatanggap sila ng 211.5 million pesos noong nakaraang taon. Beinte-kuwatro porsyento lang nito ang normal na sahod, at 66 porsyento ang dagdag.\r\nAng karaniwang manggagawa hanggang 13th\u00a0month pay plus cash gift lang ang nakukuha. Sa MWSS, aabot sa katumbas ng mahigit sa 30 buwan ang sahod kasama na ang lahat ng mga bonuses at allowances na nakuha nila.\r\nMas matindi po ang natuklasan natin sa pasahod ng kanilang Board of Trustees. Tingnan po natin ang mga allowances na tinatanggap nila:\r\nUmupo ka lang sa Board of Trustees at Board Committee meeting, 14,000 na. Aabot ng 98,000 ito kada buwan. May grocery incentive pa sila na 80,000 kada taon.\r\nHindi lang iyon: may mid-year bonus, productivity bonus, anniversary bonus, year-end bonus, at financial assistance. May Christmas bonus na, may additional Christmas package pa. Kada isa sa mga ito, 98,000.\r\nSa suma total po, aabot ang lahat ng 2.5 milyong piso kada taon sa bawat miyembro ng Board maliban sa pakotse, technical assistance, at pautang. Uulitin ko po. Lahat ng ito ay ibinigay nila sa kanilang mga sarili habang hindi pa nababayaran ang mga pensyon ng kanilang mga retirees.\r\nPati po ang La Mesa Watershed ay hindi nila pinatawad. Para magkaroon ng tamang supply ng tubig, kailangang alagaan ang mga watershed. Sa watershed, puno ang kailangan. Pati po iyon na dapat puno ang nakatayo, tinayuan nila ng bahay para sa matataas na opisyal ng MWSS.\r\nHindi naman sila agad maaalis sa puwesto dahil kabilang sila sa mga Midnight Appointees ni dating Pangulong Arroyo. Iniimbestigahan na natin ang lahat ng ito. Kung mayroon pa silang kahit kaunting hiya na natitira\u2014sana kusa na lang silang magbitiw sa puwesto. [\r\n]\r\nPag-usapan naman po natin ang pondo para sa imprastruktura. Tumukoy ang DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways] ng 246 na priority safety projects na popondohan ng Motor Vehicle Users Charge. Mangangailangan po ito ng budget na 425 million pesos.\r\nAng pinondohan po, 28 proyekto lang. Kinalimutan po ang 218 proyekto at pinalitan ng 70 proyekto na wala naman sa plano. Ang hininging 425 million pesos, naging 480 million pesos pa, lumaki lalo dahil sa mga proyektong sa piling-piling mga benepisyaryo lang napunta.\r\nMga proyekto po itong walang saysay, hindi pinag-aralan, at hindi pinaghandaan, kaya parang kabuteng sumusulpot.\r\nTapos na po ang panahon para dito. Sa administrasyon po natin, walang kota-kota, walang tongpats, ang pera ng taumbayan ay gagastusin para sa taumbayan lamang. [\r\n]\r\nMeron pa po tayong natuklasan. Limang araw bago matapos ang termino ng nakaraang administrasyon, nagpautos silang maglabas ng 3.5 billion pesos para sa rehabilitasyon ng mga nasalanta nina Ondoy at Pepeng.\r\nWalumpu\u2019t anim na proyekto ang paglalaanan dapat nito na hindi na sana idadaan sa public bidding. Labingsiyam sa mga ito na nagkakahalaga ng 981 million pesos ang muntik nang makalusot. Hindi pa nailalabas ang Special Allotment Release Order ay pirmado na ang mga kontrata.\r\nButi na lang po ay natuklasan at pinigilan ito ni Secretary Rogelio Singson ng DPWH. Ngayon po ay dadaan na ang kabuuan ng 3.5 billion pesos sa tapat na bidding, at magagamit na ang pondo na ito sa pagbibigay ng lingap sa mga nawalan ng tahanan dahil kina Ondoy at Pepeng. [\r\n]\r\nPag-usapan naman natin ang nangyari sa NAPOCOR [National Power Corporation]. Noong 2001 hanggang 2004, pinilit ng gobyerno ang NAPOCOR na magbenta ng kuryente nang palugi para hindi tumaas ang presyo. Tila ang dahilan: pinaghahandaan na nila ang eleksyon.\r\nDahil dito, noong 2004, sumagad ang pagkakabaon sa utang ng NAPOCOR. Napilitan ang pambansang gobyerno na sagutin ang 200 bilyong pisong utang nito.\r\nAng inakala ng taumbayan na natipid nila sa kuryente ay binabayaran din natin mula sa kaban ng bayan. May gastos na tayo sa kuryente, binabayaran pa natin ang dagdag na pagkakautang ng gobyerno.\r\nKung naging matino ang pag-utang, sana\u2019y nadagdagan ang ating kasiguruhan sa supply ng kuryente. Pero ang desisyon ay ibinatay sa maling pulitika, at hindi sa pangangailangan ng taumbayan. Ang taumbayan, matapos pinagsakripisyo ay lalo pang pinahirapan.\r\nGanito rin po ang nangyari sa MRT [Metro Rail Transit]. Sinubukan na namang bilhin ang ating pagmamahal. Pinilit ang operator na panatilihing mababa ang pamasahe.\r\nHindi tuloy nagampanan ang garantiyang ibinigay sa operator na mababawi nila ang kanilang puhunan. Dahil dito, inutusan ang Land Bank at Development Bank of the Philippines na bilhin ang MRT.\r\nAng pera ng taumbayan, ipinagpalit sa isang naluluging operasyon.\r\nDumako naman po tayo sa pondo ng NFA [National Food Authority].\r\nNoong 2004: 117,000 metric tons ang pagkukulang ng supply ng Pilipinas. Ang binili nila, 900,000 metric tons. Kahit ulitin mo pa ng mahigit pitong beses ang pagkukulang, sobra pa rin ang binili nila.\r\nNoong 2007: 589,000 metric tons ang pagkukulang ng supply sa Pilipinas. Ang binili nila, 1.827 million metric tons. Kahit ulitin mo pa ng mahigit tatlong beses ang pagkukulang, sobra na naman ang binili nila.\r\nAng masakit nito, dahil sobra-sobra ang binibili nila taun-taon, nabubulok lang pala sa mga kamalig ang bigas, kagaya ng nangyari noong 2008.\r\nHindi po ba krimen ito, na hinahayaan nilang mabulok ang bigas, sa kabila ng 4 milyong Pilipinong hindi kumakain ng tatlong beses sa isang araw?\r\nAng resulta nito, umabot na sa 171.6 billion pesos ang utang ng NFA noong Mayo ng taong ito.\r\nAng tinapon na ito, halos puwede na sanang pondohan ang mga sumusunod:\r\nAng budget ng buong Hudikatura, na 12.7 billion pesos sa taong ito.\r\nAng Conditional Cash Transfers para sa susunod na taon, na nagkakahalaga ng 29.6 billion pesos.\r\nAng lahat ng classroom na kailangan ng ating bansa, na nagkakahalaga ng 130 billion pesos.\r\nKasuklam-suklam ang kalakarang ito. Pera na, naging bato pa.\r\nNarinig po ninyo kung paano nilustay ang kaban ng bayan. Ang malinaw po sa ngayon: Ang anumang pagbabago ay magmumula sa pagsiguro natin na magwawakas na ang pagiging maluho at pagwawaldas.\r\nKaya nga po mula ngayon: ititigil na natin ang paglulustay sa salapi ng bayan. [\r\n] Tatanggalin natin ang mga proyektong mali.\r\nIto po ang punto ng tinatawag nating zero-based approach sa ating budget. Ang naging kalakaran po, taun-taon ay inuulit lamang ang budget na puno ng tagas. Dadagdagan lang nang konti, puwede na.\r\nSa susunod na buwan ay maghahain tayo ng budget na kumikilala nang tama sa mga problema, at magtutuon din ng pansin sa tamang solusyon.\r\nIlan lang ito sa mga natuklasan nating problema. Heto naman po ang ilang halimbawa ng mga hakbang na ginagawa natin.\r\nNandiyan po ang kaso ng isang may-ari ng sanglaan. Bumili siya ng sasakyang tinatayang nasa 26 milyong piso ang halaga.\r\nKung kaya mong bumili ng Lamborghini, bakit hindi mo kayang magbayad ng buwis?\r\nNasampahan na po ito ng kaso. Sa pangunguna nina Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, BIR [Bureau of Internal Revenue] Commissioner Kim Henares at Customs Commissioner Lito Alvarez, [\r\n] bawat linggo po ay may bago tayong kasong isinasampa kontra sa mga smuggler at sa mga hindi nagbabayad ng tamang buwis. [\r\n]\r\nNatukoy na rin po ang salarin sa mga kaso nina Francisco Baldomero, Jose Daguio at Miguel Belen, tatlo sa anim na insidente ng extralegal killings mula nang umupo tayo.\r\nSingkuwenta porsyento po ng mga insidente ng extralegal killings na nangyari sa maikling panahon ng ating panunungkulan ang patungo na sa kanilang resolusyon.\r\nAng natitira pong kalahati ay hindi natin tatantanan ang pag-usig hanggang makamit ang katarungan. [\r\n]\r\nPananagutin natin ang mga mamamatay-tao. Pananagutin din natin ang mga corrupt sa gobyerno.\r\nNagsimula nang mabuo ang ating Truth Commission, sa pangunguna ni dating Chief Justice Hilario Davide. [\r\n] Hahanapin natin ang katotohanan sa mga nangyari diumanong katiwalian noong nakaraang siyam na taon.\r\nSa loob ng linggong ito, pipirmahan ko ang kauna-unahang Executive Order na nagtatalaga sa pagbuo nitong Truth Commission.\r\nKung ang sagot sa kawalan ng katarungan ay pananagutan, ang sagot naman sa kakulangan natin sa pondo ay mga makabago at malikhaing paraan para tugunan ang mga pagkatagal-tagal nang problema.\r\nNapakarami po ng ating pangangailangan: mula sa edukasyon, imprastruktura, pangkalusugan, pangangailangan ng militar at kapulisan, at marami pang iba. Hindi kakasya ang pondo para mapunan ang lahat ng ito.\r\nKahit gaano po kalaki ang kakulangan para mapunuan ang mga listahan ng ating pangangailangan, ganado pa rin ako dahil marami nang nagpakita ng panibagong interes at kumpyansa sa Pilipinas.\r\nIto ang magiging solusyon: mga Public-Private Partnerships. Kahit wala pa pong pirmahang nangyayari dito, masasabi kong maganda ang magiging bunga ng maraming usapin ukol dito.\r\nMay mga nagpakita na po ng interes, gustong magtayo ng expressway na mula Maynila, tatahak ng Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, hanggang sa dulo ng Cagayan Valley [\r\n] nang hindi gugugol ang estado kahit na po piso.\r\nSa larangan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas:\r\nMayroon po tayong 36,000 nautical miles na baybayin. Ang mayroon lamang tayo: 32 barko. Itong mga barkong ito, panahon pa ni Gen. MacArthur. [\r\n]\r\nMay nagmungkahi sa atin, ito ang proposisyon: uupahan po nila ang headquarters ng Navy sa Roxas Boulevard at ang Naval Station sa Fort Bonifacio.\r\nSagot po nila ang paglipat ng Navy Headquarters sa Camp Aguinaldo. Agaran, bibigyan tayo ng 100 milyong dolyar. At dagdag pa sa lahat nang iyan, magsusubi pa sila sa atin ng kita mula sa mga negosyong itatayo nila sa uupahan nilang lupa.\r\nSa madali pong sabi: Makukuha natin ang kailangan natin, hindi tatayo gagastos, kikita pa tayo. [\r\n]\r\nMarami na pong nag-alok at nagmungkahi sa atin, mula lokal hanggang dayuhang negosyante, na magpuno ng iba\u2019t ibang pangangailangan.\r\nMula sa mga Public-Private Partnerships na ito, lalago ang ating ekonomiya, at bawat Pilipino makikinabang. Napakaraming sektor na matutulungan nito.\r\nMaipapatayo na po ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin para palaguin ang turismo.\r\nSa agrikultura, makapagtatayo na tayo ng mga grains terminals, refrigeration facilities, maayos na road networks at postharvest facilities.\r\nKung maisasaayos natin ang ating food supply chain sa tulong ng pribadong sektor, sa halip na mag-angkat tayo ay maari na sana tayong mangarap na mag-supply sa pandaigdigang merkado.\r\nKung maitatayo ang minumungkahi sa ating mga railway system, bababa ang presyo ng bilihin. Mas mura, mas mabilis, mas maginhawa, at makakaiwas pa sa kotong cops at mga kumokotong na rebelde ang mga bumibiyahe. [\r\n]\r\nPaalala lang po: Una sa ating plataporma ang paglikha ng mga trabaho, at nanggagaling ang trabaho sa paglago ng industriya. Lalago lamang ang industriya kung gagawin nating mas malinis, mas mabilis, at mas maginhawa ang proseso para sa mga gustong magnegosyo.\r\nPabibilisin natin ang proseso ng mga proyektong sumasailalim sa Build-Operate-Transfer. Sa tulong ng lahat ng sangay ng gobyerno at ng mga mamamayan, pabababain natin sa anim na buwan ang proseso na noon ay inaabot ng taon kung hindi dekada.\r\nMay mga hakbang na rin pong sinisimulan ang DTI [Department of Trade and Industry], sa pamumuno ni Secretary Gregory Domingo:\r\nAng walang-katapusang pabalik-balik sa proseso ng pagrehistro ng pangalan ng kumpanya, na kada dalaw ay umaabot ng apat hanggang walong oras, ibababa na natin sa 15 minuto. [\r\n]\r\nAng dating listahan ng 36 na dokumento, ibababa natin sa 6. Ang dating walong pahinang application form, ibababa natin sa isang pahina.\r\nNananawagan ako sa ating mga LGUs [local government units]. Habang naghahanap tayo ng paraan para gawing mas mabilis ang pagbubukas ng mga negosyo, pag-aralan din sana nila ang kanilang mga proseso. Kailangan itong gawing mas mabilis, at kailangan itong itugma sa mga sinisumulan nating reporma.\r\nNegosyante, sundalo, rebelde, at karaniwang Pilipino, lahat po makikinabang dito. Basta po hindi dehado ang Pilipino, papasukin po natin lahat iyan. [\r\n] Kailangan na po nating simulan ang pagtutulungan para makamit ito. Huwag nating pahirapan ang isa\u2019t isa.\r\nParating na po ang panahon na hindi na natin kailangang mamili sa pagitan ng seguridad ng ating mamamayan o sa kinabukasan ng inyong mga anak.\r\nOras na maipatupad ang Public-Private Partnerships na ito, mapopondohan ang mga serbisyong panlipunan, alinsunod sa ating plataporma.\r\nMagkakapondo na po para maipatupad ang mga plano natin sa edukasyon.\r\nMapapalawak natin ang basic education cycle mula sa napakaikling 10 taon tungo sa global standard na 12 taon.\r\nMadadagdagan natin ang mga classroom. Mapopondohan natin ang service contracting sa ilalim ng GASTPE [Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education].\r\nPati ang conditional cash transfers, na magbabawas ng pabigat sa bulsa ng mga pamilya, madadagdan na rin ng pondo.\r\nMaipapatupad ang plano natin sa PhilHealth.\r\nUna, tutukuyin natin ang tunay na bilang ng mga nangangailangan nito. Sa ngayon, hindi magkakatugma ang datos. Sabi ng PhilHealth sa isang bibig, 87 porsyento na raw ang merong coverage. Sa kabilang bibig naman, 53 porsyento naman. Ayon naman sa National Statistics Office, 38 porsyento ang may coverage.\r\nNgayon pa lang, kumikilos na si Secretary Dinky Soliman at ang DSWD [Department of Social Welfare and Development] upang ipatupad ang National Household Targetting System, na magtutukoy sa mga pamilyang higit na nagangailangan ng tulong. Tinatayang 9 bilyon ang kailangan para mabigyan ng PhilHealth ang 5 milyong pinakamaralitang pamilyang Pilipino.\r\nNapakaganda po ng hinaharap natin. Kasama na po natin ang pribadong sektor, at kasama na rin natin ang League of Provinces, sa pangunguna nina Governor Alfonso Umali kasama sina Governor L-Ray Villafuerte at Governor Icot Petilla. Handa na pong makipagtulungan para makibahagi sa pagtustos ng mga gastusin. Alam ko rin pong hindi magpapahuli ang League of Cities sa pangunguna ni Mayor Oscar Rodriguez. [\r\n]\r\nKung ang mga gobyernong lokal ay nakikiramay na sa ating mga adhikain, ang Kongreso namang pinanggalingan ko, siguro naman maasahan ko din. [\r\n]\r\nNagpakitang-gilas na po ang gabinete sa pagtukoy ng ating mga problema at sa paglulunsad ng mga solusyon sa loob lamang ng tatlong linggo.\r\nNang bagyo pong Basyang, ang sabi sa atin ng mga may prangkisa sa kuryente, apat na araw na walang kuryente. Dahil sa mabilis na pagkilos ni Secretary Rene Almendras at ng Department of Energy, naibalik ang kuryente sa halos lahat sa loob lamang ng 24 oras. [\r\n]\r\nIto pong sinasabing kakulangan sa tubig sa Metro Manila, kinilusan agad ni Secretary Rogelio Singson at ng DPWH. Hindi na siya naghintay ng utos, kaya nabawasan ang perwisyo.\r\nNakita na rin natin ang gilas ng mga hinirang nating makatulong sa Gabinete. Makatuwiran naman po sigurong umasa na hindi na sila padadaanin sa butas ng karayom para makumpirma ng Commission on Appointments. Kung mangyayari po ito, marami pa sa mga mahuhusay na Pilipino ang maeengganyong magsilbi sa gobyerno.\r\nSa lalong madaling panahon po, uupo na tayo sa LEDAC [Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council]\u00a0at pag-uusapan ang mga mahahalagang batas na kailangan nating ipasa. Makakaasa kayo na mananatiling bukas ang aking isipan, at ang ating ugnayan ay mananatiling tapat. [\r\n]\r\nIsinusulong po natin ang\r\n, kung saan hindi tayo magpapasa ng batas na mangangailangan ng pondo kung hindi pa natukoy ang panggagalingan nito. May 104.1 billion pesos tayong kailangan para pondohan ang mga batas na naipasa na, ngunit hindi maipatupad.\r\nKailangan din nating isaayos ang mga\r\nna ibinigay noong nakaraan. Ngayong naghihigpit tayo ng sinturon, kailangang balikan kung alin sa mga ito ang dapat manatili at kung ano ang dapat nang itigil.\r\nHuwag po tayong pumayag na magkaroon ng isa pang NBN-ZTE. Sa lokal man o dayuhan manggagaling ang pondo, dapat dumaan ito sa tamang proseso. Hinihingi ko po ang tulong ninyo upang amiyendahan ang ating\r\n.\r\nAyon po sa Saligang Batas, tungkulin ng estado ang siguruhing walang lamangan sa merkado. Bawal ang monopolya, bawal ang mga cartel na sasakal sa kumpetisyon. Kailangan po natin ng isang\r\nna magbibigay-buhay sa mga prinsipyong ito. Ito ang magbibigay ng pagkakataon sa mga Small- at Medium-scale Enterprises na makilahok at tumulong sa paglago ng ating ekonomiya.\r\nIpasa na po natin ang\r\n.\r\nUna rin pong naging batas ng Commonwealth ang\r\n, na ipinasa noon pang 1935. Kailangan nang palitan ito ng batas na tutugon sa pangangailangan ng pambansang seguridad sa kasalukuyan.\r\nNakikiusap po akong isulong ang\r\nupang patuloy nang iwaksi ang kultura ng takot at pananahimik. [\r\n]\r\nPalalakasin pa lalo ang\r\n. Alalahanin po natin na noong taong 2009 hanggang 2010, may nahatulan sa 95 percent ng mga kaso kung saan may witness na sumailalim sa programang ito.\r\nKailangang repasuhin ang ating mga batas. Nanawagan po akong umpisahan na ang\r\n, upang siguruhing magkakatugma sila at hindi salu-salungat.\r\nIto pong mga batas na ito ang batayan ng kaayusan, ngunit ang pundasyon ng lahat ng ginagawa natin ay ang prinsipyong wala tayong mararating kung walang kapayapaan at katahimikan.\r\nDalawa ang hinaharap nating suliranin sa usapin ng kapayapaan: ang situwasyon sa Mindanao, at ang patuloy na pag-aaklas ng CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People\u2019s Army-National Democratic Front].\r\nTungkol sa situwasyon sa Mindanao: Hindi po nagbabago ang ating pananaw. \u00a0[\r\n] Mararating lamang ang kapayapaan at katahimikan kung mag-uusap ang lahat ng apektado: Moro, Lumad, at Kristiyano. Inatasan na natin si Dean Marvic Leonen na mangasiwa sa ginagawa nating pakikipag-usap sa MILF [Moro Islamic Liberation Front].\r\nIiwasan natin ang mga pagkakamaling nangyari sa nakaraang administrasyon, kung saan binulaga na lang ang mga mamamayan ng Mindanao. [\r\n] Hindi tayo puwedeng magbulag-bulagan sa mga dudang may kulay ng pulitika ang proseso, at hindi ang kapakanan ng taumbayan ang tanging interes.\r\nKinikilala natin ang mga hakbang na ginagawa ng MILF sa pamamagitan ng pagdidisplina sa kanilang hanay. Inaasahan natin na muling magsisimula ang negosasyon pagkatapos ng Ramadan. [\r\n]\r\nTungkol naman po sa CPP-NPA-NDF: Handa na ba kayong maglaan ng kongkretong mungkahi, sa halip na pawang batikos lamang? [\r\n]\r\nKung kapayapaan din ang hangad ninyo, handa po kami sa malawakang tigil-putukan. Kayo po ba ay handa rin? Mag-usap tayo. [\r\n]\r\nMahirap magsimula ang usapan habang mayroon pang amoy ng pulbura sa hangin. Nananawagan ako: huwag po natin hayaang masayang ang napakagandang pagkakataong ito upang magtipon sa ilalim ng iisang adhikain.\r\nKapayapaan at katahimikan po ang pundasyon ng kaunlaran. Habang nagpapatuloy ang barilan, patuloy din ang pagkakagapos natin sa kahirapan.\r\nDapat din po nating mabatid: Ito ay panahon ng sakripisyo. At ang sakripisyong ito ang magiging puhunan para sa ating kinabukasan. Kaakibat ng ating mga karapatan at kalayaan ay ang tungkulin natin sa kapwa at sa bayan.\r\nInaasahan ko po ang ating mga kaibigan sa media, lalo na sa radyo at sa print, sa mga nagbablock-time, at sa community newspapers, kayo na po mismo ang magbantay sa inyong hanay.\r\nMabigyang-buhay sana ang mga batayang prinsipyo ng inyong bokasyon: ang magbigay-linaw sa mahahalagang isyu; ang maging patas at makatotohanan; at ang itaas ang antas ng pampublikong diskurso. [\r\n]\r\nTungkulin po ng bawat Pilipino na tutukan ang mga pinunong tayo rin naman ang nagluklok sa puwesto. Humakbang mula sa pakikialam tungo sa pakikilahok. Dahil ang nakikialam, walang-hanggan ang reklamo. Ang nakikilahok, nakikibahagi sa solusyon. [\r\n]\r\nNapakatagal na pong namamayani ang pananaw na ang susi sa asenso ay ang intindihin ang sarili kaysa intindihin ang kapwa. Malinaw po sa akin: Paano tayo aasenso habang nilalamangan ang kapwa?\r\nAng hindi nabigyan ng pagkakataong mag-aral, paanong makakakuha ng trabaho? Kung walang trabaho, paanong magiging konsumer? Paanong mag-iimpok sa bangko?\r\nNgunit kung babaliktarin natin ang pananaw\u2014kung iisipin nating, \u201cDadagdagan ko ang kakayahan ng aking kapwa\u201d\u2014magbubunga po ito, at ang lahat ay magkakaroon ng pagkakataon. [\r\n]\r\nMaganda na po ang nasimulan natin. At mas lalong maganda po ang mararating natin. Ngunit huwag nating kalimutan na mayroong mga nagnanasang hindi tayo magtagumpay. Dahil kapag hindi tayo nagtagumpay, makakabalik na naman sila sa kapangyarihan, at sa pagsasamantala sa taumbayan. [\r\n]\r\nAkin pong paniwala na Diyos at taumbayan ang nagdala sa ating kinalalagyan ngayon. Habang nakatutok tayo sa kapakanan ng ating kapwa, bendisyon at patnubay ay tiyak na maaasahan natin sa Poong Maykapal. At kapag nanalig tayo na ang kasangga natin ay ang Diyos, mayroon ba tayong hindi kakayanin?\r\nAng mandato nating nakuha sa huling eleksyon ay patunay na umaasa pa rin ang Pilipino sa pagbabago. Iba na talaga ang situwasyon. Puwede na muling mangarap. [\r\n] Tayo nang tumungo sa katuparan ng ating mga pinangarap.\r\nMaraming salamat po. Magandang hapon sa inyong lahat.", "title": "State of the Nation Address"},
{"delivered": "2009-07-27 14:25:03+00:00", "author": "Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo", "text": "FULL TRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered in the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City on July 27, 2009]\r\nThank you.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Before I begin my report to the nation, please join me first in a moment of prayer for President Aquino.\r\nSenate President Enrile, Speaker Nograles, Senators, Representatives, Vice President de Castro, former President Ramos, Chief Justice Puno, Ambassadors, friends:\r\nThe past 12 months have been a year for the history books. Financial meltdown in the West spread throughout the world. Tens of millions lost their jobs; billions across the globe have been hurt\u2014the poor always harder than the rich. No one was spared.\r\nIt has affected us already. But the story of the Philippines in 2008 is that the country weathered a succession of global crises in fuel, in food, then in finance and finally, economy in a global recession, never losing focus and with economic fundamentals intact. [\r\n]\r\nA few days ago, Moody\u2019s upgraded our credit rating, citing the resilience of our economy. The state of our nation is a strong economy. [\r\n] Good news for our people, bad news for our critics. [\r\n]\r\nI did not become President to be popular. To work, to lead, to protect and preserve our country, our people, that is why I became President. [\r\n] When my father left the Presidency, we were second to Japan. I want our Republic to be ready for the first world in 20 years.\r\nTowards that vision, we made key reforms. Our economic plan centers on putting people first. Higit sa lahat, ang layunin ng ating patakaran ay tulungan ang masisipag na karaniwang Pilipino. [\r\n] New tax revenues were put in place to help pay for better health care, more roads, and a strong education system. Housing policies were designed to lift up our poorer citizens so they can live and raise a family with dignity. Ang ating mga puhunan sa agrikultura ay naglalayong kilalanin ang ating mga magsasaka bilang backbone ng ating bansa, [\r\n] at bigyan sila ng mga modernong kagamitan to feed our nation and feed their own family.\r\nHad we listened to the critics of those policies, had we not braced ourselves for the crisis that came, had we taken the easy road much preferred by politicians eyeing elections, this country would be flat on its back. [\r\n] It would take twice the effort just to get it back again on its feet\u2014to where we are now because we took the responsibility and paid the political price of doing the right thing. [\r\n] For standing with me and doing the right thing, thank you, Congress.\r\nThe strong, bitter, and unpopular revenue measures of the past few years have spared our country the worst of the global financial shocks. They gave us the resources to stimulate the economy. Nabigyan nila ang pinakamalaking pagtaas ng IRA ng mga LGU na P40 billion itong taon, imparting strength throughout the country at every level of government.\r\nCompared to the past, we have built more and better infrastructure, including those started by others but left unfinished. The Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway is a prime example of building better roads. [\r\n] It creates wealth as the flagship of the Subic-Clark corridor.\r\nWe have built airports of international standard, upgraded domestic airports, built seaports and the Roll On/Roll Off system. I ask Congress for a Philippine Transport Security Law. [\r\n]\r\nSome say that after this SONA, it will be all politics. Sorry, but there\u2019s more work. [\r\n]\r\nSa telecommunications naman, inatasan ko ang Telecommunications Commission na kumilos na tungkol sa mga sumbong na dropped calls at mga nawawalang load sa cell phone. [\r\n] We need to amend the Commonwealth-era Public Service Law. And we need to do it now. [\r\n]\r\nKung noong nakaraan, lumakas ang electronics, today we are creating wealth by developing the BPO and tourism sectors as additional engines of growth. Electronics and other manufactured exports rise and fall in accordance with the state of the world economy. But BPO remains resilient. With earnings of $6 billion and employment of 600,000, the BPO phenomenon speaks eloquently of our competitiveness and productivity. [\r\n] Let us have a Department of ICT. [\r\n]\r\nIn the last four years, tourism almost doubled. [\r\n] It is now a $5 billion industry.\r\nOur reforms gave us the resources to protect our people, our financial system, and our economy from the worst of shocks that the best in the West failed to anticipate. [\r\n]\r\nThey gave us the resources to extend welfare support and enhance spending power.\r\nFor helping me raise government salaries through Joint Resolution 4, thank you, Congress. [\r\n]\r\nCash handouts give the most immediate relief and produce the widest stimulating effect. Nakikinabang ang 700,000 na pinakamahihirap na pamilya sa programang Pantawid Pamilya. [\r\n]\r\nWe prioritize projects with the same stimulus effects plus long-term contributions to progress.\r\nSa pagpapamahagi ng milyun-milyong ektaryang lupa, 700,000 na katutubo at mahigit 1 milyong benepisyaryo ng CARP ay taas-noong may-ari na ng sariling lupa. [\r\n] Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na ipasa agad ang pagpapalawig ng CARP, [\r\n] at dapat ma-condone ang P42 billion na land reform liabilities dahil 18% lamang ang nabayaran mula 1972. [\r\n] Napapanahon, because it will unfreeze the rural property market. Ang mahal kong ama ang nag-emancipate ng mga magsasaka. Ii-mancipate naman natin ngayon ang titulo.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNakinabang ang pitong milyong entrepreneurs sa P165 billion in microfinance loans.\r\nNakinabang ang 100,000 sa Emergency Employment ng ating Economic Resiliency Plan. Kasama natin ngayon ang isa sa kanila, si Gigi Gabiola. Dating household service worker sa Dubai, ngayon siya ay nagtatrabaho sa DOLE. Good luck, Gigi. [\r\n]\r\nNakinabang ang 1 milyong pamilya sa programang pabahay at palupa, mula Pag-Ibig, NHA, Community Mortgage Program, Certificates of Lot Award, at saka yung inyong Loan Condonation and Restructuring Act. Salamat.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nOur average inflation is the lowest since 1966. Last June, it dropped to 1.5%. [\r\n]\u00a0Paano?\r\nProper policies lowered interest rates, which lowered costs to business and consumers.\r\nDahil sa ating mga reporma, nakaya nating ibenta ang bigas NFA sa P18.25 per kilo, kahit tumaas ang presyo sa labas mula P17.50 hanggang P30 dahil sa kakulangan sa supply sa mundo. Habang, sa unang pagkakataon, naitaas ang pamimili ng palay sa mga magsasaka, P17 mula sa P11.\r\nDahil sa ating mga reporma, nakaya nating mamuhunan sa pagkain\u2014anticipating an unexpected global food crisis. Nakagawa tayo ng libu-libong kilometro ng farm-to-market roads at, kasama ng pribadong sector, natubigan ang 2 milyong ektarya.\u00a0[\r\n] Mga Badjao gaya ni Tarnati Dannawi ay tinuruan ng modernong mariculture. Umabot na sa P180,000 ang kinita niya mula noong nakaraang taon. Congratulations, Tarnati.\u00a0[\r\n] We will help more fisherfolk shift to fish farming with a budget of P1 billion.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nDahil dumarami na naman daw ang pamilyang nagugutom, mamumuhunan tayo ng panibago sa ating Hunger Mitigation Program na sa nakaraan ay napatunayang mabisa. Tulungan ninyo ako dito, Kongreso.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMula pa noong 2001, nanawagan na tayo ng mas murang gamot. Nagbebenta tayo ng gamot na kalahating presyo sa libu-libong Botika ng Bayan at Botika ng Barangay sa maraming dako ng bansa. Our efforts prodded the pharmaceutical companies to come up with low-cost generics and brands like RiteMed. I supported the tough version of the House of the Cheaper Medicine law. [\r\n] I supported it over the weak version of my critics. [\r\n] The result: the drug companies volunteered to bring down drug prices, slashing by half the prices of 16 drugs. Thank you, Congressmen Cua, Alvarez, Biron, Locsin. [\r\n]\r\nPursuant to law, we are placing other drugs under a maximum retail price. To those who want to be President, this advice: If you really want something done, just do it. Do it hard, do it well. Don\u2019t pussyfoot. Don\u2019t pander. And don\u2019t say bad words in public.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSa health insurance, sakop na ng 86% ang ating populasyon.\r\nSa Rent Control Law ng 2005 hanggang 2008, di pwedeng lumampas ng 10% ang pagtaas ng upa taun-taon. Ayon sa kapipirma nating batas, may isang taong moratorium, tapos hanggang 7% lamang ang maaaring pagtaas. Salamat, Kongreso.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNoong isang taon, nabiyayaan ng tig-P500 ang mahigit pitong milyong tahanan bilang Pantawid Kuryente sa mga small electricity users.\r\nYung presyo ng kuryente, ang EPIRA natin ang pangmatagalang sagot. EPIRA dismantled monopoly. Ngunit minana natin ang Power Purchase Agreements, kaya hindi pa natin nakakamtan yung buong intended effect. Pero happy na rin tayo, dahil isang taon na lamang iyan. The next generation will benefit from low prices from our EPIRA. Thank you.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSamantala, umabot na sa halos lahat ng barangay ang elektrisidad. We increased indigenous energy from 48% to 58%. Nakatipid tayo ng dollars tapos malaki pa ang na-reduce na oil consumption. The huge reduction in fossil fuel is the biggest proof of energy independence and environmental responsibility.\u00a0[\r\n]\u00a0Further reduction will come with the implementation of the Renewable Energy Act, and the Biofuels Act. Again, thank you.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe next generation will also benefit from our lower public debt-to-GDP ratio. It declined from 78% in 2000 to 55% in 2008. We cut in half the debt of government corporations from 15% to 7%; likewise foreign debt from 73% to 32%. [\r\n]\u00a0Kung meron man tayong malaking kaaway na tinalo, walang iba kundi ang utang, iyong foreign debt. Those in the past conjured the demon of foreign debt. We exorcised it.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe market grows economies. A free market, not a free-for-all.\r\nTo that end, we improved our banking system to complement its inherent conservatism. The Bangko Sentral has been prudent. Thank you, Governor Tetangco, [\r\n]\u00a0for being so effective. The BSP will be even more effective if Congress will amend its Charter.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe worked on the Special Purpose Vehicle Act, reducing nonperforming loans from 18% to 4% and improving loan-deposit ratios.\r\nOur new Securitization Law did not encourage the recklessness that brought down giant banks and insurance companies elsewhere and laid their economies to waste. In fact, it monitors and regulates the newfangled financial schemes. Thank you, Congress.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe will work to increase tax effort through improved collections and new sin taxes to further our capacity to reduce poverty and pursue growth. Revenue enhancement must come from the Department of Finance plugging leaks and catching tax and customs cheats. I call on tax-paying citizens and tax-paying businesses: help the BIR and customs stop those cheats.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nTaxes should come from alcohol and tobacco, and not from books. Tax hazards to lungs and livers, do not tax minds. [\r\n]\u00a0Ang kita mula sa buwis sa alak at sigarilyo ay dapat gamitin sa kalusugan at edukasyon. Pondohan ang PhilHealth premiums ng pinakamahihirap. Pondohan ang mas maraming classroom at computers.\r\nPardon my partiality for the teaching profession. I was a teacher, [\r\n]\u00a0kaya namuhunan tayo ng malaki sa education at skills training.\r\nAng magandang edukasyon ay susi sa mas magandang buhay, the great equalizer that allows every young Filipino a chance to realize their dreams.\r\nNagtayo tayo ng 95,000 na silid-aralan, nagdagdag ng 60,000 na guro, naglaan ng P1.5 billion para sa teacher training, especially for 100,000 English teachers.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIsa sa pinakamahirap sa Millennium Development Goals ay iyong education para sa lahat pagdating ng 2015. Ibig sabihin, lahat ng nasa tamang edad ay dapat nasa primary school. Halos walang bansang nakakatupad nito, ngunit nagsisikap pa rin tayo. Nagtayo tayo ng mga paaralan sa higit 1,000 barangay na dati walang eskwelahan upang makatipid ng gastos sa pasahe ang mga bata.\u00a0[\r\n] Tinanggal natin ang miscellaneous fees para sa primary school. Hindi na kailangan ang uniporme sa estudyante sa public school.\r\nIn private high schools, we finance half of the students.\r\nWe have provided college and postgraduate education for over 600,000 scholars. One of them, Mylene Amerol-Macumbal, finished Accounting at MSU-IIT,\u00a0[\r\n]\u00a0then she went to law school, and placed second in the last bar exams [\r\n]\u2014the first Muslim woman bar topnotcher. Congratulations!\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn technical education and skills training, we have invested three times that of three previous administrations combined.\u00a0[\r\n]\u00a0Narito si Jennifer Silbor, isa sa 10 milyong trainee. Natuto siya ng medical transcription. Now, as an independent contractor and lecturer for transcriptions in Davao, kumikita siya ng P18,000 bawat buwan. Good job, Jennifer.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe Presidential Task Force on Education, headed by Jesuit educator Father Bienvenido Nebres, has come out with the Main Education Highway towards a Knowledge-Based Economy. It envisions seamless education from basic to vocational school or college.\r\nIt seeks to mainstream early childhood development in basic education. Our children are our most cherished possession. In their early years we must make sure they get a healthy start in life. They must receive the right food for a healthy body, the right education for a bright and inquiring mind\u2014and the equal opportunity for a meaningful job.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nFor college admission, the Task Force recommends mandatory Scholastic Aptitude Tests. It also recommends that higher private education institutions and state universities and colleges should be harmonized, and also that CHED should oversee local universities and colleges. For professions seeking international recognition\u2014engineering, architecture, accountancy, pharmacy, and physical therapy\u2014the Task Force recommends radical reform: 10 years of basic education, 2 years of pre-university, before 3 years of university.\r\nOur educational system should make the Filipino fit not just for whatever jobs happen to be on offer today, but also for whatever economic challenge life will throw in their way.\r\nSa hirap at ginhawa, pinapatatag ang ating bansa ng ating overseas Filipinos. Iyong padala nilang $16 billion noong isang taon ay record. Itong taon, mas mataas pa.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI know that this is not a sacrifice joyfully borne. This is work where it can be found\u2014in faraway places, among strangers with different cultures. It is lonely work, it is hard work.\r\nKaya nagsisikap tayong lumikha dito sa atin ng mga trabahong maganda ang sahod, so that overseas work will just be a career choice, not the only option for a hardworking Filipino.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMeanwhile, we should make their sacrifices worthwhile. Dapat gumawa tayo ng mas epektibong proteksyon at pagpapalawak ng halaga ng kanilang pinagsikapang suweldo. That means stronger consumer protection for overseas Filipinos investing in property and products back home. Para sa kanila, pinapakilos natin ang Investors Protection Task Force. [\r\n]\r\nHindi ako nag-aatubiling bisitahin ang ating taong bayan at kanilang mga host sa buong mundo\u2014mula Hapon hanggang Brazil, mula Europa at Middle East hanggang sa American Midwest, nakikinig sa kanilang mga problema at pangangailangan, inaalam kung paano sila matutulungan ng ating pamahalaan\u2014by working out better policies on migrant labor, or by saving lives and restoring liberty.\r\nPagpunta ko sa Saudi, pinatawad ni Haring Abdullah ang 700 OFW na nasa preso. [\r\n] Pinuno nila ang isang buong eroplano at umuwi kasama ko. [\r\n]\r\nMula sa ating State Visit sa Espanya, it has become our biggest European donor. [\r\n] At si Haring Juan Carlos ay nakikipag-usap sa ibang mga bansa para sa ating mga namomroblemang OFW. Ganoon din si Sheikh Khalifa, ang Prime Minister ng Bahrain. [\r\n]\r\nPagpunta ko sa Kuwait, Emir Al-Sabah commuted death sentences. [\r\n] We thank all our leaders, all the world leaders, who have shown compassion for our overseas Filipino workers. Maraming salamat. [\r\n]\r\nOur vigorous international engagement has helped bring in foreign investment. Net foreign direct investments multiplied 15 times during our administration. Kasama ng ating mga OFWs, they more than doubled our foreign exchange reserves. Pinalakas ang ating piso at naiwasan ang lubhang pagtaas ng presyo. They upgraded our credit because while the reserves of our peers have shrunk this past year, our reserves grew by $3 billion. [\r\n]\r\nOur international engagement has also corrected historical injustice. The day we visited Washington, Senator Daniel Inouye successfully sponsored benefits for our veterans as part of America\u2019s stimulus package.\r\nI have accepted the invitation of President Obama to be the first Southeast Asian leader to meet him at the White House, later this week. [\r\n]\r\nThat he sought out the Philippines testifies to our strong and deep ties.\r\nHigh on our agenda will be peace and security issues. Terrorism: how to meet it, how to end it, how to address its roots in injustice and prejudice\u2014and first and always how to protect lives.\r\nWe will discuss nuclear nonproliferation. The Philippines will chair the review of the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty in New York in May 2010. The success of the talks will be a major diplomatic achievement for us.\r\nThere is a range of other issues we will discuss, including the global challenge of climate change, especially the threat to countries with long coastlines. And there is the global recession, its worse impact on poor people, and the options that can spare them from the worst.\r\nIn 2008 up to the first quarter of 2009, we stood among only a few economies in Asia Pacific that did not shrink. [\r\n] Compare this to 2001, when some of my current critics were driven out by People Power. Asia was then surging but our country was on the brink of bankruptcy. [\r\n]\r\nSince then, our economy posted uninterrupted growth for 33 quarters; more than doubled its size from $76 billion to $186 billion. The average GDP growth from 2001 to the first quarter of 2009 is the highest in 43 years. [\r\n]\r\nBumaba ang bilang ng mga nagsasabing mahirap sila sa 47% mula 59%. Maski lumaki ang ating populasyon, nabawasan ng 2 milyon ang bilang ng mahihirap. [\r\n] GNP per capita rose from a Third World $967 to $2,000. Lumikha tayo ng 8 milyong trabaho, an average of a million a year\u2014much, much more than at any other time. [\r\n]\r\nIn sum:\r\nFirst, we have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position to withstand political shocks.\r\nSecond, we built new and modern infrastructure and completed unfinished ones.\r\nThird, the economy is more fair to the poor than ever before. [\r\n]\r\nFourth, we are building a sound base for the next generation.\r\nFifth, international authorities have taken notice that we are safer from environmental degradation and man-made disasters.\r\nAs a country in the path of typhoons and in the Pacific Rim of Fire, we must be prepared as the latest technology permits to anticipate natural calamities when that is possible; to extend immediate and effective relief when it is not. The mapping of flood- and landslide-prone areas is almost complete. Early warning, forecasting, and monitoring systems have been improved, with weather tracking facilities in Subic, Tagaytay, Mactan, Mindanao, Pampanga.\r\nWe have worked on flood control infrastructure like those for Pinatubo, Agno, Laoag, and Abucay, which will pump the run off waters from Quezon City and Tondo flooding Sampaloc. This will help relieve hundreds of hectares in this old city of its age-old woe. [\r\n]\r\nPatuloy naman iyong sa Camanava, dagdag sa Pinatubo, Iloilo, Pasig-Marikina, Bicol River Basin, at mga river basin ng Mindanao.\r\nThe victims of typhoon Frank in Panay should receive their long-overdue assistance package. I ask Congress to pass the SNITS Law. [\r\n]\r\nNamana natin ang pinakamatagal na rebelyon ng Komunista sa buong mundo.\r\nSi Leah de la Cruz isa sa labindalawang libong rebel returnee. Sixteen pa lang siya nang sumali sa NPA. Naging kasapi sa regional White Area Committee, napromote sa Leyte Party Committee Secretary. Nahuli noong 2006. She is now involved in an LGU-supported handicraft livelihood training of former rebels. We love you, Leah! [\r\n]\r\nThere is now a good prospect for peace talks with both the Communist Party of the Philippines and the MILF, with whom we are now on ceasefire.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe inherited an age-old conflict in Mindanao, exacerbated by a politically popular but nearsighted policy of massive retaliation. This only provoked the other side to continue the war.\r\nIn these two internal conflicts, ang tanong ay hindi, \u201cSino ang mananalo?\u201d kundi, \u201cBakit pa ba kailangang maglaban ang kapwa Pilipino tungkol sa mga isyu na alam naman nating lahat na di malulutas sa dahas, at mareresolba lang sa paraang demokratiko?\u201d\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThere is nothing more that I would wish for than peace in Mindanao. It will be a blessing for all its people: Muslim, Christian, and Lumads. It will show other religiously divided communities that there can be common ground on which to live together in peace, harmony, and cooperation that respects each other\u2019s religious beliefs.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAt sa lahat ng dako ng bansa, kailangan nating protektahan ang ating mga mamamayan kontra sa krimen\u2014in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in their communities. How shall crime be fought? With the five pillars of justice, including crime fighters; we call on Congress to fund more policemen on the streets.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nReal government is about looking beyond the vested to the national interest, setting up the necessary conditions to enable the next, more enabled, and more empowered generation to achieve a country as prosperous, a people as content, as ours deserve to be.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe noisiest critics of constitutional reform tirelessly and shamelessly attempted Cha-Cha when they thought they could take advantage of a shift in the form of government. Now that they feel they cannot benefit from it, they oppose it.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAs the seeds of fundamental political reform are planted, let us address the highest exercise of democracy\u2014voting!\r\nIn 2001, I said we would finance fully automated elections. We got it, thanks to Congress.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAt the end of this speech I shall step down from this stage, but not from the Presidency. [\r\n] \u00a0My term does not end until next year. [\r\n]\u00a0Until then, I will fight for the ordinary Filipino. The nation comes first. There is much to do as Head of State\u2014to the very last day.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nA year is a long time. Patuloy ang pamumuhunan sa tinatawag na three E\u2019s ng ekonomiya, environment, at edukasyon. There are many perils that we must still guard against.\r\nA man-made calamity is already upon us, global in scale. As I said earlier, so far we have been spared its worst effects but we cannot be complacent. We only know that we have generated more resources on which to draw, and thereby created options we could take. Thank God we did not let our critics stop us.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAs the campaign unfolds and the candidates take to the airwaves, I ask them to talk more about how they will build up the nation rather than tear down their opponents. [\r\n]\u00a0Give the electorate real choices and not just sweet talk.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMeanwhile, I will keep a steady hand on the tiller, keeping the ship of state away from the shallows some prefer, and steering it straight on the course we set in 2001.\r\nAng ating taong bayan ay masipag at maka-Diyos. These qualities are epitomized in someone like Manny Pacquiao. [\r\n]\u00a0Manny trained tirelessly, by the book, with iron discipline, with the certain knowledge that he had to fight himself, his weaknesses first, before he could beat his opponent. [\r\n]\u00a0That was the way to clinch his victories and his ultimate title: ang pinakadakilang boksingero sa kasaysayan. [\r\n]\u00a0Mabuhay ka, Manny!\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nHowever much a President wishes it, a national problem cannot be knocked out with a single punch. A president must work with the problem as much as against it, turn it into a solution if she can.\r\nThere isn\u2019t a day I do not work at my job, or a waking moment when I do not think through a work-related problem. Even my critics cannot begrudge the long hours I put in. Our people deserve a government that works just as hard as they do.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nA President must be on the job 24/7, ready for any contingency, any crisis, anywhere, anytime.\r\nEverything right can be undone by even a single wrong. Every step forward must be taken in the teeth of political pressures and economic constraints that could push you two steps back\u2014if you flinch and falter. I have not flinched, I have not faltered. Hindi ako umatras sa hamon.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAnd I have never done any of the things that scared my worst critics so much. They are frightened by their own shadows.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn the face of attempted coups, I issued emergency proclamations just in case. But I was able to resolve these military crises with the ordinary powers of my office. My critics call it dictatorship. I call it determination.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe know it as strong government, but I never declared martial law, [\r\n]\u00a0though they are running scared as if I did. In truth, what they are really afraid of is their weakness in the face of this self-imagined threat.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI say to them: Do not tell us what we all know, that democracy can be threatened. Tell us what you will do when it is attacked.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI know what to do:\r\nAs I have shown, I will defend democracy with arms when it is threatened by violence; with firmness when it is weakened by division; with law and order when it is subverted by anarchy; and always, I will try to sustain it by wise policies of economic progress, so that a democracy means not just an empty liberty but a full life for all.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI have never expressed the desire to extend myself beyond my term. [\r\n]\u00a0Many of those who accuse me of it tried to cling like nails to their posts.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI am accused of misgovernance. Many of those who accuse me of it left me the problem of their misgovernance to solve. [\r\n]\u00a0And we did it.\r\nI am falsely accused, without proof, of using my position for personal profit. Many who accuse me have lifestyles and spending habits that make them walking proofs of that crime.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe can read their frustrations. They had the chance to serve this good country and they blew it by serving themselves.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThose who live in glass houses should cast no stones. Those who should be in jail should not threaten it, especially if they have been there.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nOur administration, with the highest average rate of growth, recording multiple increases in investments, with the largest job creation in history, and which gets a credit upgrade at the height of a world recession, must be doing something right, [\r\n]\u00a0even if some of those cocooned in corporate privilege refuse to recognize it.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nGovernance, however, is not about looking back and getting even. It is about looking forward and giving more\u2014to the people who gave us the greatest, hardest gift of all: the care of a country.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nFrom Bonifacio at Balintawak to Cory Aquino at EDSA and up to today, we have struggled to bring power to the people, and this country to the eminence it deserves.\r\nToday the Philippines is weathering well the storm that is raging around the world. It is growing stronger with the challenge. When the weather clears, as it will, there is no telling how much farther forward it can go. Believe in it. I believe.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe can and we must march forward with hope, optimism, and determination.\r\nWe must come together, work together, and walk together toward the future.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nBagamat malaking hamon ang nasa ating harapan, nasa kamay natin ang malaking kakayahan.[\r\n] Halina\u2019t pagtulungan nating tiyakin ang karapat-dapat na kinabukasan ng ating Inang Bayan.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAnd to the people of our good country, for allowing me to serve as your President: Maraming salamat.\u00a0[\r\n] [\r\n]\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas!\u00a0[\r\n] [\r\n]\r\n", "title": "Ninth State of the Nation Address"},

Aquino III", "text": "[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEsw4w0TJN0[/youtube] FULL TRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2011]\r\nSenate President Juan Ponce Enrile; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte; Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Chief Justice Renato Corona at ang ating mga kagalang-galang na mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kasapi ng diplomatic corps; mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante at ng Senado; mga local government officials; mga miyembro ng ating Gabinete; mga unipormadong kasapi ng militar at kapulisan; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan;\r\nAt sa mga minamahal kong kababayan, ang aking butihing mga Boss:\r\nHumarap po ako sa inyo noong aking inagurasyon at sinabing: Walang wangwang sa ating administrasyon. At ngayon, patuloy nating itinitigil ito. Naging hudyat at sagisag po ito ng pagbabago, hindi lamang sa kalsada, kundi pati na rin sa kaisipan sa lipunan.\r\nSa matagal na panahon, naging simbolo ng pang-aabuso ang wangwang. Dati, kung makapag-counterflow ang mga opisyal ng pamahalaan, para bang oras lang nila ang mahalaga. Imbes na maglingkod-bayan, para bang sila ang naging hari ng bayan. Kung makaasta ang kanilang mga padrino\u2019t alipores, akala mo\u2019y kung sinong maharlika kung humawi ng kalsada; walang pakialam sa mga napipilitang tumabi at napag-iiwanan. Ang mga dapat naglilingkod ang siya pang nang-aapi. Ang panlalamang matapos mangakong maglingkod\u2014iyan po ang utak-wangwang.\r\nWala silang karapatang gawin ito. Ayon sa batas, tanging ang Presidente, Bise Presidente, Senate President, House Speaker, Chief Justice, pulis, bumbero, at ambulansya lang ang awtorisadong gumamit ng wangwang para sa kanilang mga opisyal na lakad. Kung sa trapiko nga ay \u2018di masunod ang batas, paano pa kaya sa mga bagay na mas malaki ang makukuha, tulad ng sa mga proyektong [\r\n] pinopondohan ng kaban ng bayan?\r\nKayo po ba gusto ninyong makulong ang lahat ng tiwali? Ako rin po. Gusto ba ninyong matanggal ang wangwang, hindi lamang sa kalsada, kundi sa kaisipang nagdulot ng baluktot na sistema na pagkatagal-tagal na nating pinagtiisan? Ako rin. Gusto po ba ninyong mabigyan ng patas na pagkakataon ang lahat na umasenso? Siyempre ako rin po.\r\nNarito po ang halimbawa ng resulta ng ating kampanya kontra wangwang sa sistema. Nitong taong ito, taumbayan na mismo ang nagsabing nabawasan ang nagugutom sa kanila. Mula sa 20.5\u00a0percent na self-rated hunger noong Marso, bumaba na ito sa 15.1\u00a0percent nitong Hunyo, [\r\n] katumbas ng isang milyong pamilyang Pilipinong nagugutom dati, pero ngayon ay nakakakain na nang tama kada araw.\r\nSa larangan po ng negosyo, sino ba ang nag-akalang pitong ulit nating malalampasan ang all-time high ng stock market? Ang dating 4,000 index na inaakalang hindi maaabot, o kung maabot man ay pansamantala lang, ngayon, pangkaraniwan nang hinihigitan.\r\nKung dati napako na ang bansa sa mababang credit ratings, itinaas ng Moody\u2019s, Standard and Poors, Fitch, at Japan Credit Ratings Agency ang ating ranking, bilang pagkilala sa ating tamang paggugol ng pondo at sa malikhain nating pananalapi. Ang mataas na credit rating, magpapababa ng interes sa perang inuutang natin. Kumpara sa unang apat na buwan ng nakaraang taon, mas malaki po ng 23\u00a0billion pesos ang natipid nating interest payments mula Enero hanggang Abril ng 2011. Maaari na po nitong sagutin ang dalawang milyon at tatlongdaan libong benepisyaryo ng CCT [conditional cash transfer] hanggang sa katapusan ng 2011. [\r\n]\r\nPaalala ko lang po, sa siyam at kalahating taon bago tayo maitalaga sa puwesto, iisang beses lang tayong nakatikim ng ratings upgrade, at anim na beses pang na-downgrade ng iba\u2019t ibang ratings agency. Sa isang taon pa lang po natin, apat na beses na tayong nabigyan ng upgrade. [\r\n] Alam naman po natin na hindi madaling ma-upgrade sa mga panahong ito. Itong mga ratings agency, nabatikos na mali raw ang payo bago magkakrisis sa Amerika, kaya ngayon ay mas makunat na sila sa pagbibigay ng magagandang ratings, at nakikita nga natin ito sa sunud-sunod na pag-downgrade sa ibang mga bansa. Pero tayo po, in-upgrade pa nila. Sang-ayon silang lahat: gumanda at lalo pang gaganda ang ekonomiya ng Pilipinas. Isang hakbang na lang po, aabot na raw tayo sa investment grade, at wala pong tigil ang ating economic team upang tuluyan na tayong makaarangkada.\r\nAt may mabubuting balita pa pong parating. Dahil wala nang wangwang sa DOE [Department of Energy], muling nabuhay ang kumpiyansa ng mga namumuhunan sa ating energy sector. Patunay dito ang isandaan at apatnapung kumpanya na nakahandang tumaya sa eksplorasyon at pagpapalakas ng ating oil at natural gas resources. Sa huling energy contracting round noong 2006, 35 lang po ang nakilahok. Nitong Biyernes lamang po, nilagdaan na ang panibagong kasunduan para sa isang bagong power plant sa Luzon grid upang pagdating ng 2014, may mas mura at mas maaasahang pagmumulan ng enerhiya ang bansa.\r\nMay kumpiyansa, may pag-asa, at tinutupad po natin ang ating mga pangako. Naaalala ko nga po ang babaeng nakausap ko nang ako\u2019y unang nagha-house-to-house campaign para sa akin pong sarili. Ang kaniyang hinaing: \u201cMaski sino naman ang manalo, pare-pareho lang ang kahihinatnan. Mahirap ako noong sila ay nangangampanya; mahirap ako habang nakaupo sila, at malamang mahirap pa rin ako \u2018pag nagretiro na sila.\u201d Sa madaling salita, ang hinaing po ng marami, \u201cWalang pakialam ang mga pinuno namin kahapon, wala silang pakialam ngayon. Bukas, wala pa rin silang pakialam.\u201d\r\n\u2018Di po ba\u2019t may katwiran naman siya sa pagsasabi nito, dahil sa pagwawangwang sa mga ahensya ng gobyerno? Wangwang po ang pagbili ng helicopter sa presyong brand new, pero iyon pala ay gamit na gamit na. [\r\n] Wangwang din ang milyun-milyong pabuya na tinanggap ng mga opisyal ng GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation], tulad ng sa Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), gayong hindi naman sila nakapaghandog ng disenteng serbisyo, at ibinaon pa sa utang ang kanilang mga ahensya. Bago sila bumaba sa puwesto, dalawandaan tatlumpu\u2019t dalawang milyong piso po ang inomento ng dating pamunuan ng PNCC sa kanilang sarili. 2007 pa lang po, wala na silang prangkisa; lahat ng kikitain, dapat diretso na sa pambansang gobyerno. Hindi na nga nag-abot ng kita, sinamantala pa ang puwesto. Ang bonus nila mula 2005 hanggang 2009, dinoble pa nila sa unang anim na buwan ng 2010. Ibinaon na nga po nila sa bilyun-bilyong pisong utang ang kanilang tanggapan, nasikmura pa nilang magbigay ng midnight bonus sa sarili.\r\nPara\u00a0po pigilan ang pagwangwang sa kaban ng bayan, sinuyod at sinuri natin ang mga programa. Dalawang magkasunod na taon na po nating ipinatutupad ang zero-based budgeting, na magsisilbing kalasag sa walang-saysay na paggastos.\r\nSa Laguna Lake po, magtatanggal nga\u2014sabi nila\u2014ng 12\u00a0million cubic meters sa dredging, pero pagkatapos ng tatlong taon, garantisado naman itong babalik; 18.7\u00a0billion pesos ang magiging utang natin para lang maglaro ng putik. Hindi pa bayad ang utang, nag-expire na ang pakinabang. Pinigilan po natin iyan. Ang food-for-school program na bara-bara lang ang paghahanap ng benepisyaryo, at iba pang inisyatibang pinondohan ngunit walang pinatunguhan\u2014binura na natin sa budget upang ang pera namang nalibre ay mailaan sa mga proyektong totoong may silbi.\r\nAng budget po ang pinakamalinaw na pagsasabuhay ng ating tuwid na landas. Ang aking pahiwatig sa lahat ng gusto pang ilihis tayo rito: Kung mang-aagrabyado ka lang ng mahirap, huwag ka nang magtangka. Kung sarili mo lang ang papayamanin mo, huwag ka nang magtangka. Kung hindi iyan para sa Pilipino, huwag ka nang magtangka.\r\nSana\u00a0masabi na natin na tapos na ang utak-wangwang, pero nakikita po natin ang latak ng ganitong kaisipan na pilit bumubulahaw sa aliwalas ng ating biyahe sa tuwid na landas.\r\nMukhang marami rin po kasi ang nagwawangwang sa pribadong sektor. Ayon sa BIR [Bureau of Internal Revenue], mayroon tayong halos 1.7\u00a0million na self-employed at professional taxpayers gaya ng mga abogado, doktor, at negosyante na nagbayad lamang, sa sumatotal, ng 9.8\u00a0billion pesos noong 2010. 5,783 pesos lang ang ibinayad na income tax ng bawat isa raw sa kanila, on average\u2014ang ibig-sabihin, kung totoo po ito, ang kabuuang kita nila ay umaabot lang ng 8,500\u00a0pesos kada buwan. Mababa pa sa minimum wage.\r\n. [\r\n]\r\nNakikita naman po ninyong napupunta na sa tama ang buwis ninyo, kaya wala na pong dahilan upang iwasan natin ang pagbabayad. Nananawagan po ako sa inyo: Hindi lang po gobyerno, kundi kapwa natin Pilipino ang pinagkakaitan sa hindi pagbabayad ng tamang buwis.\r\nPinananagot at pananagutin po natin ang wangwang saanmang sulok ng gobyerno. Ang masakit, hanggang sa mga araw pong ito, may sumusubok pa ring makalusot. Mayroon nga pong isang distrito sa Region IV-B, may proyektong gagastusan ng 300\u00a0million pesos. Kaso hanggang 50\u00a0million pesos lang ang puwedeng aprubahan ng district engineer.\r\nKaya naisip nilang i-chop-chop ang proyekto para \u2018di lumampas sa 50\u00a0million pesos ang halaga, at \u2018di na umabot sa regional at central office ang kanilang mga papeles. Kani-kaniyang diskarte, kani-kaniyang kaharian ang nadatnan nating sitwasyon sa DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways]. Sinubukan nilang ipagpatuloy ang nakasanayan na nila. Kadalasan, dahil sa lumpsum na pagbibigay ng pondo, wala nang tanung-tanong kung ano ang plano at detalye ng proyekto. Maski yata\u2014sabi ng iba\u2014bahay ng gagamba ang ipatatayo, bibigyan ng pondo, basta may padrino.\r\nHindi ito pinalusot ni Secretary Babes Singson. [\r\n] Tinanggal na niya sa puwesto ang district engineer. Pinigilan din po ang pag-award ng proyektong ito para busisiin kung ano pang magic ang nangyari. Masusi na ring iniimbestigahan lahat ng nagkuntsabahan. Ang mga kontratistang mapatunayang nakipagsabwatan para mag-tongpats sa mga proyekto, iba-blacklist natin.\r\nTingnan nga po ninyo ang idinulot na perhuwisyo ng pagwawangwang sa sistema: Tuloy ang pagdusa ng mamamayang dapat nakikinabang na sa proyekto ng bayan.\r\nHindi lang po iyan sa Region IV-B nadiskubre. Ngunit natigil na po ito dahil hindi na padrino kundi tamang proseso ang naghahari sa DPWH. Hindi na puwedeng walang work program; kailangang magpakita ng pinag-isipang plano para hindi magkasalungat ang pagsasagawa ng mga proyekto. Malinis at hayag na ang bidding, at pantay na ang pagkakataon sa pagpasok ng mga kontratista.\r\nSa sistemang pinaiiral ngayon sa DPWH, nakatipid na tayo ng 2.5 bilyong piso, at umaasa tayo na aabot pa sa 6 hanggang 7 bilyong piso ang matitipid sa taon na ito. Ang pinakamahalaga po, nakakaasa na tayo sa mga kalsadang matino, hindi \u2018yung maambunan lang ay lulundo o mabibiyak agad. Paniwala natin dati, imposibleng maitama ng DPWH ang sistema nila. Hindi lang po ito posible; sa unang taon pa lamang, ginagawa na natin ito.\r\nKahit po sa mga bukirin, may mga nagwawangwang din. Bago tayo maupo noong 2010, nag-angkat ang bansa ng 2.3\u00a0million metric tons ng bigas. 1.3\u00a0million metric tons lamang ang kailangan nating angkatin, ngunit pinasobrahan pa nila ito ng 1 milyong tonelada. Dahil nga sobra-sobra ang inangkat, kinailangan pa nating gumastos muli sa mga bodegang pagtatambakan lang naman ng barku-barkong bigas.\r\nIlang taon bang walang saysay na pinasobrahan ang bigas na inaangkat? Dahil dito, umiral ang pag-iisip na habambuhay na tayong aangkat ng bigas. Ang akala ng marami, wala na talaga tayong magagawa.\r\nNgunit, sa loob lamang ng isang taon, pinatunayan nating mali sila. Ngayon, ang dating 1.3\u00a0million metric tons na kakulangan natin sa bigas, halos nangalahati na; 660,000\u00a0metric tons na lang [\r\n] po ang kailangan nating angkatin. Kahit dagdagan pa natin iyan ng panangga laban sa sakuna at gawing 860,000 metric tons\u2014na ginagawa na nga po natin\u2014mas mababa pa rin ito sa tinatayang taunang kakulangan na 1.3\u00a0million metric tons.\r\nAt hindi po buwenas lang ang nangyaring pag-angat ng ating rice productivity. Bunga po ito ng matinong pamamalakad: ng paggamit ng maiinam na klase ng binhi, at masusi at epektibong paggastos para sa irigasyon. Nito nga pong nakaraang taon, 11,611 bagong ektarya ng bukirin ang napatubigan natin. Dagdag pa iyan sa halos 212,000 ektarya na nakumpuni o nabigyang muli ng irigasyon matapos ang panahon ng pagkakatiwangwang. Ang resulta: umangat ng 15.6\u00a0percent ang inani nating palay noong nakaraang taon.\r\nAng gusto nating mangyari: Una, hindi tayo aangkat ng hindi kailangan, para lang punan ang bulsa ng mga gustong magsariling-diskarte ng kita sa agrikultura. Ikalawa: ayaw na nating umasa sa pag-angkat; ang isasaing ni Juan dela Cruz, dito ipupunla, dito aanihin, dito bibilhin. [\r\n]\r\nBalikan din po natin ang dinatnang kalagayan ng ating mga kawal at kapulisan. Labintatlong libong piso po ang karaniwang suweldo ng isang PO1 sa Metro Manila. Apat na libong piso daw rito ang napupunta sa upa ng bahay. Tila tama nga po na isang-katlo ng kanilang sahod diretso na sa upa. Isang-katlo pa nito, para naman sa pagkain. At ang natitirang isang-katlo, para sa kuryente, tubig, pamasahe, pampaaral sa anak, gamot sakaling may magkasakit, at iba pa. Maganda na nga po kung tumabla ang kita niya sa gastusin. Kapag naman kinapos, malamang sa 5-6 po sila lalapit. At kapag nagpatung-patong ang interes ng utang nila, makakatanggi kaya sila sa tuksong dumelihensya?\r\nKaya ang ipinangako nating solusyon pabahay nitong Pebrero, ngayong Hulyo ay tinutupad na. Nakapag-abot na po tayo ng 4,000 Certificate of Entitlement to Lot Allocation sa magigiting nating kawal at pulis. Bahagi pa lang po ito ng target nating kabuuang 21,800 bahay sa pagtatapos ng taong ito. Ang dating apat na libong ibinabayad para sa upa kada buwan, ngayon, dalawandaang piso na lang, para pa sa bahay na pagmamay-ari talaga nila. [\r\n] Ang dating nalalagas na halaga na pambayad sa buwanang renta, maaari nang igugol para sa ibang gastusin.\r\nMayroon pa raw pong mahigit 1,000 bahay na natitira, kaya po sa mga pulis at sundalo nating \u2018di pa nakakapagpasa ng kanilang mga papeles, last call na po para sa batch na ito. Pero huwag po kayong mag-alala, sa susunod na taon, lalawak pa ang ating pabahay, at hindi lang pulis at kawal sa Luzon ang makikinabang. Inihahanda na ng NHA [National Housing Authority] ang lupang patatayuan sa Visayas at Mindanao, para sa susunod na taon, makapagpapatayo [\r\n] na tayo ng mga bahay doon. Sa ating mga kawani ng Bureau of Jail Management and Penology at Bureau of Fire Protection, may good news pa rin po ako sa inyo: kasama na po kayo rito. [\r\n]\r\nKung seguridad na rin lang po ang ating pag-uusapan, \u2018di ba\u2019t karugtong din nito ang ating pambansang dangal? Dati, hindi man lang natin makuhang pumalag tuwing may sisindak sa atin sa loob mismo ng ating bakuran. Malinaw ang pahiwatig natin ngayon sa buong mundo: Ang sa Pilipinas ay sa Pilipinas; [\r\n] kapag tumapak ka sa Recto Bank, para ka na ring tumapak sa Recto Avenue. [\r\n]\r\nTama nga po kaya ang kuwento tungkol sa isang stand-off noong araw? Tinapatan daw ang mga marino natin ng kanyon. Ang ginawa nila noong gabi, pumutol ng puno ng niyog, pininturahan ito ng itim, saka itinutok sa kalaban. [\r\n] Tapos na po ang panahong iyan. Parating na ang mga capability upgrade at modernization ng mga kagamitan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas. Literal na pong naglalakbay sa karagatan papunta rito ang kauna-unahan nating Hamilton Class Cutter, [\r\n] isang mas modernong barko na magagamit natin para mabantayan ang ating mga baybayin. Maaari pa po tayong makakuha ng mga barkong tulad nito. Idadagdag iyan sa kukunin na nating mga helicopter (plural po iyon), patrol craft, at sandata na bultong bibilhin ng AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines], PNP [Philippine National Police], kasama na ang DOJ [Department of Justice] upang makakuha ng malaking diskuwento. Lahat po ito, makakamtan sa matinong pamamahala; mabibili sa tamang presyo, nang walang kailangang ipadulas kung kani-kanino.\r\nWala tayong balak mang-away, pero kailangan ding mabatid ng mundo na handa tayong ipagtanggol ang atin. [\r\n] Pinag-aaralan na rin po natin ang pag-angat ng kaso sa West Philippine Sea [\r\n] sa International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, upang masigurong sa mga susunod na pagkakataon ay hinahon at pagtitimpi ang maghahari tuwing may alitan sa teritoryo.\r\nAlam ko pong magbubunga ang pag-aarugang ipinapamalas natin sa mga lingkod-bayan na nakatutok sa ating seguridad. Mantakin po ninyo: sa unang anim na buwan ng 2010, umabot sa 1,010 kotse at motorsiklo ang nanakaw. Ikumpara po natin iyan sa 460 kotse at motorsiklong nanakaw mula Enero hanggang Hunyo ng taong ito. Ang laki po ng naibawas, \u2018di po ba? Malas ko lang po siguro na \u2018yung isa o dalawang kaso ng carnapping ang naihe-headline, at hindi ang pagbawas sa mga insidente nito o ang mas mataas na porsyento ng mga nanakaw na kotse na naibalik na sa kanilang mga may-ari.\r\nIsa pa pong halimbawa ng pagbabagong tinatamasa natin: Mayo ng taong 2003 nang lagdaan ang Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, pero dahil hindi sineryoso ng estado ang pagpapatupad nito, 29 na indibiduwal lamang ang nahatulan sa loob ng pitong taon. Nalagpasan na po natin iyan, dahil umabot na sa 31 human traffickers ang nahatulan sa ating administrasyon. Ito nga po siguro ang sinasabing \u201csea change\u201d ni Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ng Amerika. Dahil dito, natanggal na tayo sa Tier 2 Watchlist ng Trafficking in Persons Report nila\u00a0[\r\n]. Kung hindi tayo natanggal sa watchlist na ito, siguradong napurnada pa ang mga grant na maaari nating makuha mula sa Millenium Challenge Corporation at iba pa.\r\nDumako po tayo sa trabaho. Dagdag-trabaho ang unang panata natin sa Pilipino. Ang 8\u00a0percent na unemployment rate noong Abril ng nakaraang taon, naibaba na sa 7.2\u00a0percent nitong Abril ng 2011. [\r\n] \u00a0Tandaan po natin: moving target ang nasa hanay ng ating unemployed, dahil taun-taon ay may mga bagong graduate na naghahanap ng trabaho. Nito nga pong huling taon, nadagdag pa sa bilang nila ang libu-libong hawi boys, tagasabit ng banderitas, at iba pang mga Pilipinong kumuha ng pansamantalang kabuhayan mula sa eleksyon. Ang resulta po natin: 1.4 milyon trabahong nalikha nitong nakaraang taon, nagtatapos po ng Abril.\r\nDati, nakapako sa pangingibang-bansa ang ambisyon ng mga Pilipino. Ngayon, may pagpipilian na siyang trabaho, at hangga\u2019t tinatapatan niya ng sipag at determinasyon ang kanyang pangangarap, tiyak na maaabot niya ito.\r\nMalaki pa po ang puwedeng madagdag sa trabahong nalilikha sa ating bansa. Ayon pa lang po sa website nating Philjobnet, may 50,000 trabahong hindi napupunan, napupunuan, kada buwan dahil hindi tugma ang kailangan ng mga kumpanya sa kakayahan at kaalaman ng mga naghahanap ng trabaho. Hindi po natin hahayaang masayang ang pagkakataong ito; ngayon pa lang, nagtatagpo na ang kaisipan ng DOLE [Department of Labor and Employment], CHED [Commission on Higher Education], TESDA [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority], at DepEd upang tugunan ang isyu ng job mismatch. Susuriin ang mga curriculum para maituon sa mga industriyang naghahanap ng empleyado, at gagabayan ang mga estudyante sa pagpili ng mga kursong hitik sa bakanteng trabaho.\r\nNgunit aanhin naman po natin ang mga numerong naghuhudyat ng pag-asenso ng iilan, kung marami pa rin ang napag-iiwanan? Ang unang hakbang: tinukoy natin ang totoong nangangailangan; namuhunan tayo sa pinakamahalaga nating yaman:\r\n. Sa 2 milyong pamilyang rehistrado sa ating Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, 1.6 milyon na ang nakakatanggap ng benepisyo nito. Sa pagpapakitang-gilas ni Secretary Dinky Soliman, tinatayang may mahigit 100,000 pamilya [\r\n]\u2014uulitin ko po: mahigit 100,000 pamilya ang naiaahon natin mula sa kahirapan kada buwan. Kaya naman mataas ang aking kumpiyansang makukumpleto ang 1.3\u00a0million na dagdag na pamilya, mula sa kabuuang 2.3\u00a0milyong target na benepisyaryo ng CCT bago matapos ang taong ito. At sa compliance rate nito na hindi bababa sa 92\u00a0percent, milyun-milyon na rin po ang inang regular na nagpapa-checkup sa mga health center, ang mga sanggol na napabakunahan, at ang mga batang hindi hinahayaan sa labas ng paaralan. [\r\n]\r\nSimula pa lang po ito, at sa ganitong kalinaw na mga resulta, umaasa ako sa suporta ng bawat Pilipino, lalo na po ng lehislatura, sa mungkahi nating salinan pa ng pondo ang Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. Inaasam po natin na bago matapos ang 2012, 3 milyong pamilya na ang mabibigyan ng puhunan para sa kanilang kinabukasan.\r\nBinibigyan natin ang mga maralitang pamilyang ito ng pagkakataong makaahon sa buhay, dahil ang pag-asenso nila ay pag-angat rin ng buong bansa. Sino ang tatangkilik sa mga produkto at serbisyo ng mga negosyante, kung isang kahig, isang tuka naman ang mamimili? Kapag may amang kumakapit sa patalim para may kainin ang kanyang pamilya, at siya ay magnakaw o nangholdap, sino ba ang puwedeng mabiktima ng krimen kundi tayo rin? Kung ang mga kababayan natin ay walang maayos na pagkain o tahanan, mahina ang kalusugan at may malubhang karamdaman, hindi ba\u2019t tayo rin ang nasa peligrong mahawa sa kanilang sakit?\r\nNaglalatag po tayo ng pagbabago upang mapatibay ang pundasyon ng maaliwalas na bukas para sa lahat. Halimbawa po, sa kalusugan: di ba\u2019t kapansin-pansin ang pagtaas ng bilang ng mga benepisyaryo ng PhilHealth tuwing maghahalalan? Ngayon, sa pamamagitan ng National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR), tiniyak natin na ang 5.2 milyon pamilyang Pilipino na nakikinabang sa PhilHealth ay ang talagang mga nangangailangan nito. Malawakang pag-unlad at pag-asenso ng lahat: Iyan po ang panata natin. Walang maiiwan sa tuwid na landas. [\r\n]\r\nTumungo naman po tayo sa ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]. Ang dating sistema: Nagbabatuhan lang ng huwad na utang ng loob ang mga baluktot na kandidato. Kapag pambansang halalan, malaya ang nakaupo sa ARMM na imane-obra ang makinarya sa kaniyang rehiyon para matiyak na bokya, o sero, ang boto ng hindi kaalyado. Kapag naman eleksyon sa ARMM at maniningil na ng utang si Mayor o Governor, ang administrasyon naman ang magpapatakbo ng makinarya para manalo ang kanilang kandidato.\r\nAyon nga po sa naungkat ng COA [Commission on Audit], sa opisina ng regional governor ng ARMM, mula Enero 2008 hanggang Setyembre 2009, walumpung\u2014uulitin ko po: 80 porsyento ng mga disbursement ang napunta sa mga cash advance na wala namang maayos na paliwanag. Kung hindi nawala ang pondong ito, nakatapos na sana ang isang batang sa ngayon tumatawid sa ghost bridge, para pumasok sa ghost school, kung saan tuturuan siya ng ghost teacher. [\r\n] Kaawa-awang bata: walang humpay na paghihirap, at walang pag-asa ng pag-asenso.\r\nGusto nating maranasan ng ARMM ang benepisyo ng tamang pamamahala. Kaya ang atin pong minungkahing solusyon: synchronization. Dahil dito, kailangan nilang tumutok sa kani-kanilang mga kampanya; magiging mas patas ang labanan, at lalabnaw ang command votes. Salamat po sa Kongreso at naipasa na ang batas na magsasabay sa halalan ng ARMM sa halalang pambansa. [\r\n]\r\nMay nagtatanong po, bakit postponement ang kailangan? Sa kagustuhang, siyempre, makabalik sa puwesto, nakahanda ang ilan na ulitin ang nakagawian para manalo. Isipin na lang po ninyo kung pumayag tayo sa kagustuhan ng mga kontra, at itinuloy natin ang eleksyon. Wala po silang ibang gagawin sa loob ng dalawang taon kundi paghandaan ang susunod na halalan at isiksik ang kalokohan nila sa mas maigsing panahon. Habang nananatili sa puwesto ang mga utak wangwang na opisyal, naiiwan namang nakalubog sa kumunoy ng kawalang-pagasa ang taumbayan.\r\nWala akong duda sa kahihinatnan ng mga repormang inilatag na natin. Hindi po tayo nagbubukambibig lang; may kongkretong resulta ang ating mga paninindigan. Kapag sinabi nating tuwid na daan, may katapat itong kalsada sa Barangay Bagumbayan sa Sta. Maria, Laguna. \u2018Pag sinabi nating malinis na pamamahala, may dadaloy na malinis na tubig sa mga liblib na lugar gaya ng nasa Barangay Poblacion, sa Ferrol, Romblon. Kapag sinabi nating liwanag ng pagbabago, titiyakin nating may liwanag na tatanglaw sa mga pamayanang dati ay nangangapa sa aandap-andap na gasera, gaya ng ginawa natin sa Barangay San Marcos, sa Bunawan, Agusan del Sur. Ganito na ang nangyayari sa marami pang ibang lugar; pinipilit nating ito rin ang mangyari sa kabuuan ng Pilipinas.\r\nNakatutok na po ang iba\u2019t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno; nag-uugnayan at nagtutulungan sila upang maabot at mapabilis ang mga solusyon sa mga problemang kaytagal nang pinapasan ng bayan.\r\nDi po ba\u2019t may problema tayo sa baha, na alam naman nating dulot ng walang humpay at ilegal na pagputol ng mga puno? Ang dating solusyon: photo-op ng pagtatanim na ang tanging benepisyaryo ay nagpapoging pulitiko. Nagtanim nga ng puno kontra-baha, pero hindi naman siniguro na mananatiling nakatayo ang mga ito pag-alis nila.\r\nIsa sa mga solusyong hinahanda na po at pinag-aaralan ay ang gawing kapaki-pakinabang sa mga pamayanan ang pagbabantay ng puno. Bibigyan sila ng binhi ng kape at cacao para itanim at mamunga ng kabuhayan. Habang hinihintay ang ani, makakakuha sila ng stipend upang bantayan naman ang mga punong itinanim laban sa baha. Puwedeng maging benepisyaryo ng programang ito ang mga informal settlers, na ngayon ay nagkukumpulan sa siyudad. Mamumuhunan tayo sa taumbayan, habang namumuhunan din sa kalikasan.\r\nNoon bang isang taon, inisip kaya natin na kaya nating gawin ito? Sa ngayon, tinutupad na natin ang ating mga pangako. Bukas makalawa, katotohanan na ang lahat ng ating mga pinangarap. [\r\n]\r\nMarami pa pong malikhaing konsepto na inilalapit sa atin, at ang atin pong ipinatupad na. May mosquito trap na pinapatay ang mga kiti-kiti ng lamok, na siguro naman po ay may kinalaman sa halos 14 porsiyentong pagbaba ng insidente ng dengue; may hibla ng niyog na itatapon na sana, pero puwede palang murang solusyon sa mga daanang madaling mabitak; may landslide sensor na magbababala kung tumaas na ang panganib na gumuho ang lupa; may mga kagamitang magbibigay ng senyales kung malapit nang umapaw ang tubig sa mga ilog. Lahat po nito, gawa ng Pilipino.\r\nPinag-aaralan na rin po ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology] at UP [University of the Philippines] ang pagkakaroon natin ng monorail system, [\r\n] para tugunan ang problema sa pangmalawakang transportasyon. Sa malikhaing pag-iisip ng kapwa Pilipino, may pag-asa pala tayong magtayo ng light rail system nang hindi hihigit sa 100\u00a0million pesos ang gagastusin kada kilometro. Sa matitipid na pondo, mas mahabang kilometro ng riles ang mailalatag at makaka-abot sa mga lugar na malayo sa sentro ng komersyo. Ang mga dating sumisiksik sa siyudad para maghanap ng trabaho, maaari nang tumira sa medyo mas malayo, nang hindi pahirapan ang biyahe.\r\nUulitin ko po: ang mungkahing ito ay galing sa kapwa natin Pilipino, para sa Pilipinas. Naaalala po ba ninyo ang panahon kung kailan ni hindi man lang maabot ng mga pangarap natin ang ganitong mga proyekto? Ngayon, sinasabi ko po sa inyo: pinapangarap natin ito, kaya natin ito, gagawin natin ito. Hindi ba tayo nagagalak, Pilipino tayong nabubuhay sa mga panahong ito? [\r\n]\r\nSa kabila ng lahat ng ito, huwag po sana nating lilimutin: masasayang lang ang lahat ng ating narating kung hindi tuluyang maiwawaksi ang kultura ng korupsyon na dinatnan natin.\r\nSa mga kapwa ko empleyado ng sambayanan, mula sa tuktok hanggang sa bawat sulok ng burukrasya: Di po ba\u2019t napakarangal na ngayon ang magtrabaho sa gobyerno? Di po ba\u2019t ngayon, sa halip na ikahiya, gusto mo pang isuot kung minsan ang iyong ID kung sumasakay ka ng bus o jeep papasok sa iyong ahensya? Sasayangin po ba natin ang karangalang kaloob sa atin ng sambayanan?\r\nIyan din po ang aking panawagan sa ating local government units (LGUs). Kabilang po ako sa mga sumasang-ayon na kayo ang pinaka-nakakaalam sa pangangailangan ng taumbayan sa inyong mga lungsod at munisipyo. Makakaasa po ang ating mga LGU sa higit na kalayaan at kakayahan, kung makakaasa rin tayong gagamitin ito sa tuwid na paraan, at isasaalang-alang ang kapakanan ng buong sambayanan.\r\nHalimbawa po, may ilang munisipyo na naisipang magbuwis sa mga transmission lines ng kuryente na dadaan sa kanilang mga pook. Magpapasok nga po ng kita sa kanilang lokal na kaban, pero kapalit nito, tataas din ang gastusin ng mas nakararaming Pilipino sa kuryente. Tiwala po akong kaya nating balansehin ang interes ng inyong mga nasasakupan sa interes ng sambayanan.\r\nKailangan pong manatiling magkatugma ang ating mga programa, dahil ang ikauunlad ng buong bansa ay manganganak din ng resulta sa inyong mga pook. Wakasan na po sana natin ang agendang nakatuon sa susunod na eleksyon lamang, at ang kaisipang isla-isla tayong maihihiwalay ang sariling pagsulong sa pag-unlad ng bansa.\r\nTayu-tayo rin po ang dapat magtulungan tungo sa kaunlaran. Malaki ang pasasalamat ko sa Kongreso sa pagpapasa ng mga batas ukol sa GOCC Governance, ARMM Synchronization, [\r\n] Lifeline Electricity Rates Extension, Joint Congressional Power Commission Extension, Children and Infants\u2019 Mandatory Immunization, at Women Night Workers, at marami pa sigurong pasunod.\r\nNoong isang taon nga po, nagpakitang-gilas ang Kongreso sa pagpasa ng budget bago matapos ang taon. Dahil dito, nasimulan agad ang mga proyekto at hindi na inabot ng tag-ulan. Bukas na bukas po, ihahain na namin sa lehislatura ang budget para sa susunod na taon. [\r\n] Umaasa po ako na muli kayong magpapakitang-gilas, upang tuluyan na nating mapitas ang bunga ng mga naitanim nating pagbabago.\r\nMaganda na po ang ating nasimulan. Pero mahalaga pong maalala natin: simula pa lang ito. Marami pa tayong gagawin. Hayaan po ninyong ilatag ko sa Kongreso ang ilan sa mga batas na magpapaigting sa pagtupad ng ating mga panata sa bayan.\r\nLayon nating bigyan ng kaukulang kompensasyon ang mga biktima ng Martial Law; [\r\n] ang pagkakaloob ng makatarungang pasahod at benepisyo para sa mga kasambahay; at ang pagpapatupad ng isang mas maayos na sistema ng pensyon para sa atin pong mga kawal. Sinusuportahan din natin ang pagpapalawak ng sakop ng scholarship na ipinagkakaloob ng DOST sa mahuhusay ngunit kapuspalad na mag-aaral; ang pagtataguyod ng pinaigting na pangkalahatang kalusugan; at ang pangangalaga sa ating kalikasan at sa mga pasilidad na titiyak sa kaligtasan ng mga mamamayan sa oras ng sakuna.\r\nKabilang din po sa ating agenda ang pagpapalakas ng Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), ng National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), ng National Electrification Administration (NEA), at pati na rin po ng PTV\u00a04, upang sa halip na mapag-iwanan ng kaalaman at panahon, mas maayos nilang magagampanan ang kanilang pagbibigay-serbisyo sa publiko.\r\nHindi ko po nailagay ang lahat ng gustong magpasali ng kanilang adbokasiya dito po sa SONA. Pero kumpleto po ang detalye sa budget at budget message. Sa mga interesado po, pakibasa na lang detalye doon.\r\nMay mga nagsasabing pinepersonal ko raw ang paghahabol sa mga tiwali.\r\n: Personal talaga sa akin ang paggawa ng tama, [\r\n] at ang pagpapanagot sa mga gumagawa ng mali\u2014sino man sila. At hindi lamang dapat ako ang namemersonal sa usaping ito. Personal dapat ito sa ating lahat, dahil bawat Pilipino ay biktima nito. [\r\n]\r\nAng mali\u2014gaano katagal man ito nanatili\u2014ay mali pa rin. Hindi puwedeng \u201cOks lang\u201d; hindi puwedeng \u201cwala lang iyan.\u201d Kapag kinalimutan natin ang mga ito, mangyayari lang ulit ang mga kamalian ng nakaraan. Kung hindi magbabayad ang mga nagkasala, parang tayo na rin mismo ang nag-imbita sa mga nagbabalak gumawa ng masama na kung puwede, uulitin ninyo ang ginawa ninyo. [\r\n]\r\nAng totoo nga po, marami pang kalokohan ang nahalungkat natin\u2014pero hindi na po magpapakahaba doon, bigyan ko na lang kayo ng isang halimbawa. Sa PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]: kape. Isang bilyong piso po ang ginastos ng dating pamunuan ng ahensya para sa kape; sa 100 piso na lang po kada tasa, lalabas na nakakonsumo sila ng 10 milyong tasa ng kape. [\r\n] Baka po kahit ngayong iba na ang pamunuan ng PAGCOR ay dilat na dilat pa rin ang mata ng mga uminom ng kapeng ito. [\r\n]\u00a0Hanapin nga po natin sila, at matanong: nakakatulog pa po kayo? [\r\n]\r\nPagpasok ng bagong Ombudsman na si dating Supreme Court Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales, [\r\n] magkakaroon tayo ng tanod-bayan na hindi magiging tanod-bayad ng mga nagwawangwang sa pamahalaan. Inaasahan ko nga po na sa taon na ito, masasampahan na ng kaso ang maraming nagkuntsabahan sa katiwalian, at naging sanhi ng situwasyong ating inabutan. Tapos na rin po ang panahon kung kailan nagsasampa ang gobyerno ng malalabnaw na kaso. Kapag tayo ang nagsampa, matibay ang ebidensya, malinaw ang testimonya, at siguradong walang lusot ang salarin. [\r\n]\r\nTutok po tayo na ang pagkakamit ng ganap na katarungan ay hindi natatapos sa pagsasakdal kung hindi sa pagkukulong ng maysala. Buo ang kumpiyansa ko na tinutupad ng Department of Justice ang malaki nilang bahagi upang maipiit ang mga salarin, lalo na sa mga kaso ukol sa tax evasion, drug trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, graft and corruption, at extrajudicial killings. [\r\n]\r\nWala pong tsamba: ang tapat at mabuting pamamahala ay nanganganak ng mabuti ring resulta. Isipin po ninyo: naipatupad natin ang mga ipinangakong serbisyo ng gobyerno, at nakapaglaan pa ng sapat na pondo para sa mga proyekto nang hindi kinailangang magtaas ng buwis.\r\nIyan naman po talaga ang plano: siguruhin na patas ang laban; itigil ang panlalamang ng mga makapangyarihan; at tiyakin na ang dating sistema kung saan nakikinabang ang iilan ay magiging bukal ng oportunidad para sa lahat.\r\nTinutuldukan na po natin ang wangwang: sa kalsada, sa gobyerno, sa kalakhang lipunan. Ito po ang manganganak ng kumpiyansa na magdadala ng negosyo; ito rin ang sisiguro na ang pondo ng taumbayan ay mapupunta sa dapat nitong kalagyan: Imprastruktura na titiyak sa tuluyang pag-angat ng ekonomiya at pagmumulan ng trabaho, at serbisyong panlipunan na sisigurong walang mapapag-iiwanan. Bubukas ang marami pang pintuang pangkabuhayan sa pamamagitan ng turismo; sisiguruhing hindi magugutom ang Pilipino sa pagpapalakas ng agrikultura. Ang mga dating kinakaligtaan, bibigyang-puhunan ang kinabukasan.\r\nMagbubunsod ito ng siklo kung saan tiyak na may pupuno sa mga nalilikhang trabaho, at may mga konsumer na lalong magpapalago sa mga negosyo.\r\nBatid ko po na hanggang ngayon ay may kakaunti pang nagrereklamo sa ating istilo ng pamamahala. Nakita po ninyo ang aming istilo, at ang kaakibat nitong resulta. Nakita po ninyo ang istilo nila, at kung saan tayo nito dinala. Sa mga taong bukas ang mata, maliwanag kung saan ang tama.\r\nNgayong tayo na ang nagtitimon sa gobyerno, malinaw ang direksyong tinatahak ng ating bayan. Isang bansa kung saan ang pagkakataon ay abot-kamay; kung saan ang mga nangangailangan ay sinasaklolohan; kung saan may saysay ang bawat patak ng pawis, bawat sandali ng pagtitiis, at bawat butil ng hinagpis na dinaanan natin. Kung may gawin kang mabuti, may babalik sa iyong mabuti. At kung may gawin kang masama, tiyak na mananagot ka. [\r\n]\r\nNaaalala ko nga po ang isang ginang na lumapit sa akin noong kampanya; ang babala niya, \u201cNoy, mag-iingat ka, marami kang kinakabangga.\u201d\r\nTama po ang sabi niya: Tama pong may agam-agam din ako kung minsan. Pero wala po akong alinlangang tumahak sa tuwid na daan: Buo ang loob ko dahil alam kong nasa likod ko po kayo. Salamat po. [\r\n]\r\nSalamat po sa mga pari at obispo na masinsinang nakipagdiyalogo sa atin, katulad nina Cardinal Rosales at Vidal. Di naman po kami ganoong kalapit ni Cardinal Rosales, pero naniniwala akong ibinuhos niya ang lahat para mabawasan ang hindi pinagkakaunawaan ng gobyerno at simbahan. Sa pagkahalal kay Archbishop Palma, tagapagtanggol ng karapatang pantao at kalikasan, lalo pong tumibay ang aking kumpiyansang ugnayan, at hindi bangayan, ang mabubuo sa pagitan ng estado at simbahan. [\r\n]\r\nSalamat din po sa ating Gabinete, na walang kinikilalang panahon ng tulog o pahinga, maipatupad lang ang pambansang agenda. Special mention po ang PAGASA [Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration], na tunay na ngayong nagbibigay ng maaasahang babala. [\r\n]\r\nAt sa mga nasasagasaan po natin sa landas ng katapatan at integridad sa pamamahala, ito naman po ang aking masasabi: Pinili ninyo ang landas kung saan naaapi ang sambayanan. Pinili naman namin ang landas na ipagtanggol ang taumbayan. [\r\n] Nasa tama po kami; nasa mali kayo. Sa inyong magbabalik ng pang-aapi sa sambayan,\r\n. [\r\n]\r\nSa lahat ng mga kasama natin sa tuwid na daan: kayo ang lumikha ng pagkakataong baguhin ang dinatnan, at gawing mas maganda ang ipapamana natin sa susunod na salinlahi ng mga Pilipino. Kayo pong mga tsuper na pumapasada pa rin; kayong mga guro at estudyanteng pauwi pa lang mula sa klase; kayong patuloy ang paglikha ng mga obrang nagpapaalab sa apoy ng ating pagka-Pilipino; kayong mga pulis, sundalo, kaminero, at bumbero; kayong mga marangal na magtrabaho, sa Pilipinas man, sa gitnang dagat, o sa ibang bansa; kayong mga tapat na kasama natin sa gobyerno, anumang probinsya o partido; kayong mga Pilipinong nakikinig sa akin ngayon\u2014kayo po ang lumikha ng pagkakataong ito.\r\nLumikha po kayo ng gobyernong tunay na nagtatrabaho para sa inyo. May limang taon pa tayo para siguruhing hindi na tayo babalik sa dating kalagayan. Hindi tayo magpapadiskaril ngayong napakaganda na ng resulta ng ating sinimulan.\r\nKapag may nakita tayong butas sa sistema, huwag na po tayo magtangkang lumusot. Huwag na nating daanin sa pakiusap ang madadaan sa pagsisikap. Tama na ang unahan, tama na ang tulakan, tama na ang lamangan, dahil lahat naman po tayo ay makakarating sa minimithi nating kinabukasan.\r\nTapusin na po natin ang kultura ng negatibismo; iangat natin ang kapwa-Pilipino sa bawat pagkakataon. Bakit po ang iba, ang hilig maghanap ng kung anu-anong pangit sa ating bayan? At napakahirap\u2014parang kasalanan\u2014na magsabi ng maganda? Naalala pa po ba natin noong huling beses tayong pumuri sa kapwa Pilipino?\r\nItigil na po natin ang paghihilahan pababa. Ang dating industriya ng pintasan na hindi natin maitakwil, iwaksi na po natin. Tuldukan na po natin ang pagiging utak-alimango; puwede bang iangat naman natin ang magaganda nating nagawa?\r\nKung may nakita kang mabuti, huwag kang magdalawang-isip na purihin ito. Kapag nakita mo ang pulis sa kanto, nagtatrapik nang walang kapote sa ilalim ng ulan, lapitan mo naman sana at sabihing, \u201cSalamat po.\u201d\r\nKung magkasakit ka at makita mo ang nars na nag-aruga sa iyo, sa halip na magserbisyo sa dayuhan kapalit ng mas malaking suweldo, pakisabi rin po, \u201cSalamat po.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nBago ka umuwi galing eskuwela, lapitan mo ang guro mong piniling mamuhunan sa iyong kinabukasan kaysa unahin ang sariling ginhawa; sabihin mo, \u201cSalamat po\u201d: Tulad ng aking gurong nasa screen ngayon, Salamat po Ginang Escasa. [\r\n]\r\nKung makasalubong mo ang iyong kinatawan sa kalsadang dati ay lubak-lubak (o wala), at ngayon ay puwede nang daanan nang maaliwalas, lapitan mo siya at sabihing: \u201cSalamat po.\u201d\r\nKaya po, sa sambayanang Pilipino, ang aking Boss na nagtimon sa atin tungo sa araw na ito: maraming, maraming salamat po sa pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon.\r\nBuhay na buhay na ang Pilipinas at ang Pilipino.", "title": "Second State of the Nation Address"},

Senate President Villar. Senators and Representatives. Vice President de Castro, President Ramos, Chief Justice Puno, members of the diplomatic corps, ladies and gentlemen:\r\nI address you today at a crucial moment in world history.\r\nJust a few months ago, we ended 2007 with the strongest economic growth in a generation. Inflation was low, the peso strong, and a million new jobs were created. We were all looking to a better, brighter future. [\r\n]\r\nBecause tough choices were made, kumikilos na ang bayan sa wakas. Malapit na sana tayo sa pagbalanse ng budget. We were retiring debts in great amounts, reducing the drag on our country\u2019s development, habang namumuhunan sa taong bayan.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nBiglang-bigla, nabaligtad ang ekonomiya ng mundo. Ang pagtalon ng presyo ng langis at pagkain ay nagbunsod ng pandaigdigan krisis, the worst since the Great Depression and the end of World War II. Some blame speculators moving billions of dollars from subprime mortgages to commodities like fuel and food. Others point of the very real surge in demand as millions of Chinese and Indians move up to the middle class.\r\nWhatever the reasons, we are on a roller coaster ride of oil price hikes, high food prices, and looming economic recession in the US and other markets. Uncertainty has moved like a terrible tsunami around the globe, wiping away gains, erasing progress.\r\nThis is a complex time that defies simple and easy solutions. For starters, it is hard to identify villains, unlike in the 1997 financial crisis. Everyone seems to be a victim, rich countries and poor, though certainly some can take more punishment than others.\r\nTo address these global challenges, we must go on building and buttressing bridges to allies around the world: to bring in the rice to feed our people; investments to create jobs; and to keep the peace and maintain stability in our country and the rest of the world. Yet even as we reach out to those who need, and who may need us, we strive for greater self-reliance.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nBecause tough choices were made, the global crisis did not catch us helpless and unprepared. Through foresight, grit, and political will, we built a shield around our country that has slowed down and somewhat softened the worst effects of the global crisis. [\r\n]\u00a0We have the money to care for our people and pay for food when there are shortages; for fuel despite price spikes.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNeither we nor anyone else in the world expected this day to come so soon but we prepared for it. For the guts not to flinch in the face of tough choices, I thank God. For the wisdom to recognize how needed you are, I thank you Congress.\u00a0[\r\n]\u00a0For footing the bill, I thank the taxpayers.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe result has been, on the one hand, ito ang nakasalba sa bayan; on the other, more unpopularity for myself in the opinion polls. Yet even unfriendly polls show self-rated poverty down to its 20-year low in 2007.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMy responsibility as President is to take care, to solve the problems we are facing now, and to provide a vision and direction for how our nation should advance in the future.\r\nMany in this great hall live privileged lives and exert great influence in public affairs. I am accessible to you, but I spend time every day with the underprivileged and under represented who cannot get a grip on their lives in the daily, all-consuming struggle to make ends meet.\r\nNag-aalala ako para sa nakakaawang maybahay na pasan ang pananagutan para sa buong pamilya. Nag-aalala ako para sa magsasakang nasa unang hanay ng pambansang produksyon ng pagkain ngunit nagsisikap pakanin ang pamilya. I care for hardworking students soon to graduate and wanting to see hope of good job and a career prospect here at home.\r\nNag-aalala ako para sa 41-year old na padre de pamilya na di araw-araw ang trabaho, at nag-aabala sa asawa at tatlong anak, at dapat bigyan ng higit pang pagkakakitaan at dangal. I care for our teachers who gave the greatest gift we ever received\u2014a good education\u2014still trying to pass on the same gift to succeeding generations. I care for our OFWs, famed for their skill, integrity, and untiring labor, who send home their pay as the only way to touch loved ones so far away. [\r\n]\u00a0Nagpupugay ako ngayon sa kanilang mga karaniwang Pilipino.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMy critics say this is fiction, along with other facts and figures I cite today. I call it heroism though they don\u2019t need our praise. Each is already a hero to those who matter most\u2014their families.\r\nI said this is a global crisis where everyone is a victim. But only few can afford to avoid, or pay to delay, the worst effects.\r\nMany more have nothing to protect them from the immediate blunt force trauma of the global crisis. Tulad ninyo, nag-aalala ako para sa kanila. Ito ang mga taong bayan na dapat samahan natin. Not only because of their sacrifices for our country but because they are our countrymen.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nHow do we solve these many complex challenges?\r\nSa kanilang kalagayan, the answer must be special care and attention in this great hour of need.\r\nFirst, we must have a targeted strategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease the price challenges we are facing.\r\nSecond, food self-sufficiency; less energy dependence; greater self-reliance in our attitude as a people and in our posture as a nation.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThird, short-term relief cannot be at the expense of long-term reforms. [\r\n]\u00a0These reforms will benefit not just the next generation of Filipinos, but the next President as well.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNapakahalaga ang value-added tax [VAT] sa pagharap sa mga hamong ito.\r\nItong programa ang sagot sa mga problemang namana natin.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nUna, mabawasan ang ating mga utang and shore up our fiscal independence.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nPangalawa, higit na pamumuhunan para mamamayan at imprastraktura.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nPangatlo, sapat na pondo para sa mga programang pangmasa.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThus, the infrastructure links programmed for the our poorest provinces like Northern Samar: Lao-ang-Lapinig-Arteche, right now ay maputik; San Isidro-Lope de Vega; the rehabilitation of Maharlika in Samar.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nTake VAT away and you and I abdicate our responsibility as leaders and pull the rug from under our present and future progress, which may be compromised by the global crisis.\r\nLalong lumakas ang tiwala ng mga investor dahil sa VAT. Mula P56.50 kada dolyar, lumakas ang piso hanggang P40.20 bago bumalik sa P44 dahil sa mga pabigat ng pangdaigdigang ekonomiya. Kung alisin ang VAT, hihina ang kumpiyansa ng negosyo, lalong tataas ang interes, lalong bababa ang piso, lalong mamahal ang bilihin.\r\nKapag ibinasura ang VAT sa langis at kuryente, ang mas makikinabang ay ang mga maykaya na kumukonsumo ng 84% ng langis at 90% ng kuryente habang mas masasaktan ang mahihirap na mawawalan ng P80 billion para sa mga programang pinopondohan ngayon ng VAT. [\r\n]\u00a0Take away VAT and we strip our people of the means to ride out the world food and energy crisis.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe have come too far and made too many sacrifices to turn back now on fiscal reforms. Leadership is not about doing the first easy thing that comes to mind; it is about doing what is necessary, however hard.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe government has persevered, without flip-flops, in its much-criticized but irreplaceable policies, including oil and power VAT and oil deregulation.\r\nPatuloy na gagamitin ng pamahalaan ang lumalago nating yaman upang tulungan ang mga pamilyang naghihirap sa taas ng bilihin at hampas ng bagyo, habang nagpupundar upang sanggahan ang bayan sa mga krisis sa hinaharap.\r\nPara sa mga namamasada at namamasahe sa dyip, sinusugpo natin ang kotong at colorum upang mapataas ang kita ng mga tsuper. [\r\n]\u00a0Si Federico Alvarez kumikita ng P200 a day sa kaniyang rutang Cubao-Rosario. Tinaas ito ng anti-kotong, anti-colorum ngayon P500 na ang kita niya. [\r\n]\u00a0Iyan ang paraan kung paano napananatili ang dagdag-pasahe sa P1 lamang. Halaga lang ng isang text.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nTexting is a way of life. I asked the telecoms to cut the cost of messages between networks. They responded. It is now down to 50 centavos.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNoong Hunyo, nagpalabas tayo ng 4 bilyong piso mula sa VAT sa langis\u20142 bilyong pambayad ng koryente ng 4 milyong mahihirap, 1 bilyon para college scholarship o pautang sa 70,000 na estudyanteng maralita; [\r\n]\u00a0kalahating bilyong pautang upang palitan ng mas matipid na LPG, CNG, o biofuel ang motor ng libu-libong jeepney; [\r\n]\u00a0at kalahating bilyong pampalit sa fluorescent sa mga pampublikong lugar.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nKung mapapalitan ng fluorescent ang lahat ng bumbilya, makatitipid tayo ng lampas P2 billion.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSa sunod na katas ng VAT, may P1 billion na pambayad ng kuryente ng mahihirap; kalahating bilyon para sa matatandang di sakop ng SSS o GSIS; kalahating bilyong kapital para sa pamilya ng mga namamasada; kalahating bilyon upang mapataas ang kakayahan at equipment ng mga munting ospital sa mga lalawigan. [\r\n]\u00a0At para sa mga kalamidad, angkop na halaga.\r\nWe released P1 billion for the victims of typhoon Frank. We support a supplemental Western Visayas calamity budget from VAT proceeds,[\r\n] as a tribute to the likes of Rodney Berdin, age 13, of Barangay Rombang, Belison, Antique, who saved his mother, brother, and sister from the raging waters of Sibalom River.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMula sa buwang ito, wala nang income tax ang sumusweldo ng P200,000 o mas mababa sa isang taon\u2014P12 billion na bawas-buwis para sa maralita at middle class. Maraming salamat, Congress.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNgayong may P32 na commercial rice, natugunan na natin ang problema sa pagkain sa kasalukuyan. Nagtagumpay tayo dahil sa pagtutulungan ng buong bayan sa pagsasaka, bantay-presyo, at paghihigpit sa price manipulation, sa masipag na pamumuno ni Artie Yap.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSa mga LGU at religious groups na tumutulong dalhin ang NFA rice sa mahihirap, maraming salamat sa inyo.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nDahil sa subsidy, NFA rice is among the region\u2019s cheapest. While we can take some comfort that our situation is better than many other nations, there is no substitute for solving the problem of rice and fuel here at home. In doing so, let us be honest and clear eyed\u2014there has been a fundamental shift in global economics. The price of food and fuel will likely remain high. Nothing will be easy; the government cannot solve these problems over night. But we can work to ease the near-term pain while investing in long-term solutions.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSince 2001, new irrigation systems for 146,000 hectares, including Malmar in Maguindanao and North Cotabato, Lower Agusan, Casecnan and Aulo in Nueva Ecija, Abulog-Apayao in Cagayan and Apayao, Addalam in Quirino and Isabela among others, and the restoration of old systems on another 980,000 hectares have increased our nation\u2019s irrigated land to a historic 1.5 million hectares.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nEdwin Bandila, 48 years old, of Ugalingan, Carmen, North Cotabato, cultivated 1 hectare and harvested 35 cavans. Thirteen years na ginawa iyong Malmar. In my first State of the Nation Address, sabi ko kung hindi matapos iyon sa Setyembre ay kakanselahin ko ang kontrata, papapasukin ko ang engineering brigade, natapos nila. With Malmar, now he cultivates 5 hectares [\r\n]\u00a0and produces 97 cavans per hectare. Mabuhay, Edwin! VAT will complete the San Roque-Agno River project.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe Land Bank has quadrupled loans for farmers and fisherfolk. That is fact not fiction. Check it. For more effective credit utilization, I instructed DA to revitalize farmers cooperatives.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe are providing seeds at subsidized prices to help our farmers.\r\nIncremental Malampaya national revenues of P4 billion will go to our rice self-sufficiency program.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nRice production since 2000 increased an average of 4.07% a year, twice the population growth rate. By promoting natural planning and female education, we have curbed population growth to 2.04% during our administration, down from the 2.36% in the 1990s, when artificial birth control was pushed. [\r\n]\u00a0Our campaign spreads awareness of responsible parenthood regarding birth spacing. Long years of pushing contraceptives made it synonymous to family planning. Therefore, informed choice should mean letting more couples, who are mostly Catholics, know about natural family planning.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nFrom 1978 to 1981, nag-export tayo ng bigas. Hindi tumagal. But let\u2019s not be too hard on ourselves. Panahon pa ng Kastila bumibili na tayo ng bigas sa labas. While we may know how to grow rice well, topography doesn\u2019t always cooperate.\r\nNature did not gift us with a mighty Mekong like Thailand and Vietnam, with their vast and naturally fertile plains. Nature instead put our islands ahead of our neighbors in the path of typhoons from the Pacific. So, we import 10% of the rice we consume.\r\nTo meet the challenge of today, we will feed our people now, not later, and help them get through these hard times. To meet the challenges of tomorrow, we must become more self-reliant, self-sufficient, and independent, relying on ourselves more than on the world.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNow we come to the future of agrarian reform.\r\nThere are those who say it is a failure, that our rice importations prove it. There are those who say it is a success\u2014if only because anything is better than nothing. Indeed, people are happier owning the land they work, no matter what the difficulties.\r\nSa SONA noong 2001, sinabi ko, bawat taon, mamamahagi tayo ng 200,000 ektarya sa reporma sa lupa: 100,000 hectares of private farmland; and 100,000 of public farmland, including ancestral domains. Di hamak mahigit sa target ang naipamahagi natin sa nakaraang pitong taon: 854,000 hectares of private farmland, 797,000 of public farmland, and Certificates of Ancestral Domain for 525,000 hectares. [\r\n]\u00a0Including, over a 100,000 hectares for the Bugkalots in Quirino, Aurora, and Nueva Vizcaya. After the release of their CADT, Rosario Camma, Bugkalot chieftain, and now mayor of Nagtipunan, helped his 15,000-member tribe develop irrigation, plant vegetables and corn, and achieve food sufficiency. Mabuhay, Chief!\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAgrarian reform should not merely subdivide misery, it must raise living standards. Ownership raises the farmer from his knees but productivity will keep him on his feet.\r\nSinimula ng aking ama ang land reform noong 1963. Upang mabuo ito, the extension of CARP with reforms is top priority. [\r\n]\u00a0I will continue to do all I can for the rural as well as urban poor. Ayaw natin na paglaya ng tenant sa landlord, mapapasa-ilalim naman sa usurero. Former tenants must be empowered to become agribusinessmen by allowing their land to be used as collateral.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nDapat mapalaya ng reporma sa lupa ang magsasaka sa pagiging alipin sa iba. Dapat bigyan ang magsasaka ng dangal bilang taong malaya at di hawak ninuman. We must curb the recklessness that gives land without the means to make it productive and bites off more than beneficiaries can chew.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAt the same time, I want the rackets out of agrarian reform: [\r\n]\u00a0the threats to take and therefore undervalue land, the conspiracies to overvalue it.\r\nBe with me on this. There must be a path where justice and progress converge. Let us find it before Christmas. [\r\n]\u00a0Dapat nating linisin ang landas para sa mga ibig magpursige sa pagsasaka, taglay ang pananalig na ang lupa ay sasagip sa atin sa huli kung gamitin natin ito nang maayos.\r\nAlong with massive rice production, we are cutting costs through more efficient transport. For our farm-to-market roads, we released P6 billion in 2007.\r\nOn our nautical highways. RORO boats carried 33 million metric tons of cargo and 31 million passengers in 2007. We have built 39 RORO ports during our administration, 12 more are slated to start within the next two years. In 2003, we inaugurated the Western Nautical Highway from Batangas through Mindoro, Panay and Negros to Mindanao. This year we launched the Central Nautical Highway from Bicol mainland through Masbate, Cebu, Bohol and Camiguin to Mindanao mainland. [\r\n]\u00a0These developments strengthen our competitiveness.\r\nLeading multinational company Nestle cut transport costs and offset higher milk prices abroad. Salamat, RORO. [\r\n]\u00a0Transport costs have become so reasonable for bakeries like Gardenia, a loaf of its bread in Iloilo is priced the same as in Laguna and Manila. Salamat muli sa RORO.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nTo the many LGUs who have stopped collecting fees from cargo vehicles, maraming, maraming salamat.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe are repaving airports that are useful for agriculture, like Zamboanga City Airport.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nProducing rice and moving it cheaper addresses the supply side of our rice needs. On the demand side, we are boosting the people\u2019s buying power.\r\nGinagawa nating labor-intensive ang paggawa at pag-ayos ng kalsada at patubig. Noong SONA ng 2001, naglunsad tayo sa NCR ng patrabaho para sa 20,000 na out of school youth, na tinawag na OYSTER. Ngayon, mahigit 20,000 ang ineempleyo ng OYSTER sa buong bansa. [\r\n]\u00a0In disaster-stricken areas, we have a cash-for-work program.\r\nIn training, 7.74 million took technical and vocational courses over the last seven years, double the number in the previous 14 years. In 2007 alone, 1.7 million graduated. Among them are Jessica Barlomento now in Hanjin as supply officer, Shenve Catana, Marie Grace Comendador, and Marlyn Tusi, lady welders, congratulations.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn microfinance, loans have reached P102 billion or 30 times more than the P3 billion we started with in 2001, with a 98% repayment record, congratulations! [\r\n]\u00a0Major lenders include the Land Bank with P69 billion, the Peoples\u2019 Credit and Finance Corporation P8 billion, the National Livelihood Support Fund P3 billion, DBP P1 billion, and the DSWD\u2019s SEA-K P800 million. For partnering with us to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit, thank you, Go Negosyo and Joey Concepcion.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nUpland development benefits farmers through agro-forestry initiatives. Rubber is especially strong in Zamboanga Sibugay and North Cotabato. [\r\n]\u00a0Victoria Mindoro, 56 years old, used to earn P5,000 a month as farmer and factory worker. Now she owns 10 hectares in the Goodyear Agrarian Reform Community in Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay, earning P10,000 a week. [\r\n]\u00a0With 1 hectare, Pedro and Concordia Faviolas of Makilala, North Cotabato, sent their six children to college, bought two more hectares, and earn P15,000 a month. Congratulations!\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nJatropha estates are starting in 900 hectares in and around Tamlang Valley in Negros Oriental; 200 in CamSur; 300 in GenSan, 500 in Fort Magsaysay near the Cordero Dam, and 700 in Samar, among others.\r\nIn our 2006 SONA, our food baskets were identified as North Luzon and Mindanao.\r\nThe sad irony of Mindanao as food basket is that it has some of the highest hunger in our nation. It has large fields of high productivity, yet also 6 of our 10 poorest provinces.\r\nThe prime reason is the endless Mindanao conflict. A comprehensive peace has eluded us for half a century. But last night, differences on the tough issue of ancestral domain were resolved. Yes, there are political dynamics among the people of Mindanao. Let us sort them out with the utmost sobriety, patience, and restraint. I ask Congress to act on the legislative and political reforms that will lead to a just and lasting peace during our term of office.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe demands of decency and compassion urge dialogue. Better talk than fight, if nothing of sovereign value is anyway lost. Dialogue has achieved more than confrontation in many parts of the world. This was the message of the recent World Conference in Madrid organized by the King of Saudi Arabia, and the universal message of the Pope in Sydney.\r\nPope Benedict\u2019s encyclical Deus Caritas Est reminds us: \u201cThere will always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love for neighbour is indispensable.\u201d\r\nPinagsasama-sama natin ang mga programa ng DSWD, DOH, GSIS, SSS, at iba pang lumalaban sa kahirapan sa isang National Social Welfare Program para proteksyonan ang pinakamahihirap mula sa pandaigdigang krisis, and to help those whose earnings are limited by illness, disability, loss of job, age, and so on\u2014through livelihood projects, microfinance, skills and technology transfer, emergency and temporary employment, pension funds, food aid and cash subsidies, child nutrition and adult health care, medical missions, salary loans, insurance, housing programs, educational and other savings schemes, and now cheaper medicine\u2014thanks to Congress.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe World Bank says that in Brazil, the income of the poorest 10% has grown 9% per year versus the 3% for the higher income levels due in large part to their family stipend program linking welfare checks to school attendance. We have introduced a similar program, Pantawid Pamilya.\r\nEmployers have funded the two increases in SSS benefits since 2005. Thank you, employers, for paying the premiums.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nGSIS pensions have been indexed to inflation and have increased every year since 2001. Its salary loan availments have increased from two months equivalent to 10 months, the highest of any system public or private\u2014while repayments have been stretched out.\r\nPag-Ibig housing loans increased from P3.82 billion in 2001 to P22.6 billion in 2007. This year it experienced an 84% increase in the first four months alone. [\r\n]\u00a0Super heating na. Dapat dagdagan ng GSIS at buksan muli ng SSS ang pautang sa pabahay. I ask Congress to pass a bill allowing SSS to do housing loans beyond the present 10% limitation.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nBago ako naging Pangulo, 1.5 milyong maralita lamang ang may health insurance. Noong 2001, sabi natin, dadagdagan pa ng kalahating milyon. Sa taong iyon, mahigit 1 milyon ang nabigyan natin. Ngayon, 65 milyong Pilipino na ang may health insurance, mahigit doble ng 2000, kasama ang 15 milyong maralita. [\r\n]\u00a0PhilHealth has paid P100 billion for hospitalization. The indigent beneficiaries largely come from Central and West Visayas, Central Luzon, and Ilocos. Patuloy nating palalawakin itong napaka-importanteng programa, lalo na sa Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga Norte, Maguindanao, Apayao, Dinagat, Lanao Sur, Northern Samar, Masbate, Abra, and Misamis Occidental. Lalo na sa kanilang mga magsasaka at mangingisda.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn these provinces and in Agusan Sur, Kalinga, Surigao Sur, and calamity-stricken areas, we will launch a massive school feeding program at P10 per child every school day.\r\nBukod sa libreng edukasyon sa elementarya at high school, nadoble ang pondo para sa mga college scholarships, while private high school scholarship funds from the government have quadrupled.\r\nI have started reforming and clustering the programs of the DepEd, CHED, and TESDA.\r\nAs with fiscal and food challenges, the global energy crunch demands better and more focused resource mobilization, conservation, and management.\r\nGovernment agencies are reducing their energy and fuel bills by 10%, emulating Texas Instruments and Philippine Stock Exchange who did it last year. Congratulations, Justice Vitug and Francis Lim.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nTo reduce power system losses, we count on government regulators and also on EPIRA amendments.\r\nWe are successful in increasing energy self-sufficiency\u201456%, the highest in our history. We promote natural gas and biofuel; geothermal fields, among the world\u2019s largest; windmills like those in Ilocos and Batanes; and the solar cells lighting many communities in Mindanao. The new Galoc oil field can produce 17,000 to 22,000 barrels per day, 1/12 of our crude consumption.\r\nThe Renewable Energy Bill has passed the House. Thank you, Congressmen and Congresswomen.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nOur costly commodity imports like oil and rice should be offset by hard commodities exports like primary products, and soft ones like tourism and cyberservices, at which only India beats us.\r\nOur P350 million training partnership with the private sector should qualify 60,000 for call centers, medical transcription, animation, and software development, which have a projected demand of 1 million workers generating $13 billion by 2010.\r\nInternational finance agrees with our progress. Credit rating agencies have kept their positive or stable outlook on the country. Our world competitiveness ranking rose five notches. Congratulations to us.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe are sticking to, and widening, the fiscal reforms that have earned us their respect.\r\nTo our investors, thank you for your valuable role in our development. [\r\n]\u00a0I invite you to invest not only in factories and services, but in profitable infrastructure, following the formula for the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI ask business and civil society to continue to work for a socially equitable, economically viable balance of interests. Mining companies should ensure that host communities benefit substantively from their investments, and with no environmental damage from operations.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nOur administration enacted the Solid Waste Management Act, Wildlife Act, Protection of Plant Varieties, Clean Water Act, Biofuels Act, and various laws declaring protected areas.\r\nFor reforestation, for next year we have budgeted P2 billion. [\r\n]\u00a0Not only do forests enhance the beauty of the land, they mitigate climate change, a key factor in increasing the frequency and intensity of typhoons and costing the country 0.5% of the GDP.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe have set up over 100 marine and fish sanctuaries since 2001. In the whale shark sanctuary of Donsol [Sorsogon], Alan Amanse, a 40-year-old college undergraduate and father of two, was earning P100 a day from fishing and driving a tricycle. Now as whale shark-watching officer, he earns P1,000 a day, 10 times his former income.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nFor clean water, so important to our health, there is P500 million this year and P1.5 billion for next year.\r\nFrom just one sanitary landfill in 2001, we now have 21, with another 18 in the works.\r\nWe launched the Zero Basura Olympics to clear our communities of trash. Rather than more money, all that is needed is for each citizen to keep home and workplace clean, and for garbage officials to stop squabbling.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nOur investments also include essential ways to strengthen our institutions of governance in order to fight the decades-old scourge of corruption. I will continue to fight this battle every single day. [\r\n]\u00a0While others are happy with headlines through accusation without evidence and privilege speeches without accountability, we have allocated more than P3 billion\u2014the largest anti-graft fund in our history\u2014for real evidence gathering and vigorous prosecution.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nFrom its dismal past record, the Ombudsman\u2019s conviction rate has increased 500%. [\r\n]\u00a0Lifestyle checks, never seriously implemented before our time, have led to the dismissal and/or criminal prosecution of dozens of corrupt officials.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI recently met with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. agency that provides grants to countries based on governance. They have commended our gains, contributed P1 billion to our fight against graft, and declared us eligible for more grants. Thank you!\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nLast September, we created the Procurement Transparency Group in the DBM and linked it with business, academe, and the Church, to deter or catch anomalies in government contracts.\r\nOn my instruction, the BIR and Customs established similar government-civil society tie-ups for information gathering and tax evasion and smuggling monitoring.\r\nMore advanced corruption practices require a commensurate advances in legislative responses. Colleagues in Congress, we need a more stringent Anti-Graft Act.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSa pagmahal ng bilihin, hirap na ang mamimili\u2014tapos, dadayain pa. Dapat itong mahinto. Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na magpasa ng Consumer Bill of Rights laban sa price gouging, false advertising, at iba pang gawain kontra sa mamimili.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI call on all our government workers at the national and local levels to be more responsive and accountable to the people. Panahon ito ng pagsubok. Kung saan kayang tumulong at dapat tumulong ang pamahalaan, we must be there with a helping hand. Where government can contribute nothing useful, stay away. Let\u2019s be more helpful, more courteous, more quick.\r\nKaakibat ng ating mga adhikain ang tuloy na pagkalinga sa kapakanan ng bawat Pilipino. Iisa ang ating pangarap\u2014maunlad at mapayapang lipunan, kung saan ang magandang kinabukasan ay hindi pangarap lamang, bagkus natutupad.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nSama-sama tayo sa tungkuling ito. May papel na gagampanan ang bawat mamamayan, negosyante, pinunong bayan, at simbahan, sampu ng mga nasa lalawigan.\r\nWe are three branches but one government. We have our disagreements; we each have hopes, and ambitions that drive and divide us, be they personal, ethnic, religious, and cultural. But we are one nation with one fate.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nAs your President, I care too much about this nation to let anyone stand in the way of our people\u2019s well-being.

Aquino III", "text": "[\r\n.]\r\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 27, 2015]\r\nMaraming salamat po. Maupo ho tayo lahat.\r\nBago po ako magsimula, hihingi ako ng paumanhin, dahil hindi natin nagawa ang tradisyonal na processional walk. Hindi na rin po natin nakamayan ang lahat ng nag-abang. Medyo masama po kasi ang ating pakiramdam sa kasalukuyan.\r\nBise Presidente Jejomar Binay; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon at mga miyembro ng Senado; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. at mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga kasapi ng militar, pulis, at iba pang kawani mula sa ating unipormadong hanay; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan, magandang hapon sa inyong lahat. [Palakpakan]\r\nIto ang aking ikaanim na SONA. Muli akong humaharap sa Kongreso at sa sambayanan upang iulat ang lagay ng atin pong bansa. Mahigit limang taon na ang lumilipas mula nang itinigil natin ang wang-wang, hindi lang sa kalsada, kundi sa buong lipunan; mula nang pormal tayong nanumpang labanan ang katiwalian upang masugpo ang kahirapan; at mula nang natuto muling mangarap ang Pilipino, ang atin pong mga boss. Mga Boss, ito ang kuwento ng ating paglalakbay sa Daang Matuwid.\r\nNito lang pong Biyernes,\r\nnatin ang Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway. Una po ito sa nakapilang Public-Private Partnerships na tayo ang nag-apruba, at sa ilalim ng administrasyon natin binuksan sa publiko. Sa atin pong mga sinundan: Halos magmakaawa ang pamahalaan sa pribadong sektor na lumahok sa mga proyekto. Ngayon sila na ang sumusuyo\u2014dito nga po sa MCX, binayaran pa tayo ng premium na P925 million para sa pribilehiyong itayo ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin. Sa taas din ng kumpiyansa nilang kikita ang proyekto, sabi ng private proponent, libre na ang unang buwan ng toll sa MCX.\r\nTalaga nga pong napakalayo na ng ating narating. Para isakonteksto ito, magbalik-tanaw tayo.\r\nDinatnan natin ang taumbayang namanhid na sa walang humpay na alegasyon ng kasinungalingan, pandaraya, at pagnanakaw.\r\nIpinagmalaki sa ating sapat na raw ang mga classroom. Iyon pala, umaabot sa apat na shift ang mga klase. May pumapasok nang madilim pa, at may umuuwing madilim na\u2014pero lahat sila, naiwan sa dilim dahil hindi sapat ang oras ng pag-aaral.\r\n\u201cUninterrupted growth\u201d ang ibinida ng ating sinundan sa\r\n. Pero nang suriin po, malaking bahagi pala nito ay galing sa remittances ng mga taong nawalan ng pag-asa sa Pilipinas. Ika nga po, \u201cPeople were voting with their feet.\u201d Kung gagayahin ko ang ganitong estilo, kikilabutan akong angkinin ang tagumpay na nagmula sa pagpapalayas ng ating mga kababayan.\r\nNang papalapit ang eleksiyon ng 2004, lampas P700 milyon ang diumano\u2019y pinambili ng fertilizer na di-angkop sa pananim, sobrang taas ng presyo, at sa maraming pagkakataon ay hindi man lang nasilayan ng mga magsasaka. Sino kaya ang napataba ng patabang ito? Klarong hindi pananim o magsasaka. Naalala rin po siguro ninyo ang NBN-ZTE scandal. Inimbestigahan namin ito sa Senado; may nagsabing siya raw ay tinangkang suhulan. Nang usisain, ayaw namang magsalita dahil may executive privilege daw siya. Hindi rin naman maipatawag ang dating pangulo\u2014kaya ang natirang matatanong ay ang alipores niyang akusado ng panunuhol. Natural, itinanggi niya ang paratang.\r\nNoong mga panahong iyon, maski bata, natutuhan na ang salitang \u201cscam.\u201d Naaalala siguro ninyo: Ang Hello Garci, na sinagot lang ng \u201cI am sorry.\u201d Ang mga tunay na bank account ng bogus na si Jose Pidal. Ang tinangkang Constitutional Assembly para habambuhay na manatili sa puwesto. Ang\r\nna nagtangkang supilin ang katotohanan. Ang pagdeklara ng State of Emergency, para umilag sa checks and balances ng\r\nukol sa Martial Law. Ang midnight appointments. Ang Calibrated Preemptive Response na ginamit laban sa mga nagpoprotesta. Sa wika pa lang po, mali na ito. Paano nauuna ang response? Para mo na ring sinabing nag-reply ka sa taong hindi ka naman tinext [text].\r\nIto po ang mga headline na araw-araw nating inalmusal bago tayo manungkulan. Pag-upo naman natin sa puwesto, sunod-sunod nating nadiskubre ang kalokohan ng ating pinalitan. Nabanggit ko na po sa\r\n: Sa NFA, pinalobo ang utang mula P12.3 billion noong 2001, patungong P176.8 billion noong Hunyo 2010. Sinabayan ito ng sobra-sobrang pag-angkat ng bigas na nabulok lang sa kamalig. Sa PAGCOR, isang bilyong piso para sa kape. Sa MWSS: Patong-patong na pa-bonus. Sa Laguna Lake: higit sa P18 bilyon ang tinangkang lustayin sa paglalaro ng putik. Di ko nga po lubos maisip kung paanong naatim ng mga pasimuno nito ang makinabang sa pagdurusa ng ating mga kababayan.\r\nBawat opisyal ng gobyerno, nanunumpang maging makatarungan sa kapwa at sumunod sa batas. Pero klaro: Ang ginawa ng nauna sa atin, kabaliktaran nito. Nakita natin ang pinakamasahol na ehemplo noong Nobyembre ng 2009, nang pinaslang ang 58 na Pilipino sa Maguindanao. Isipin lang ito, mali na. Ginawa nila, lalong mali pa. Pero ang matindi po: Naniwala silang malulusutan ito, dahil nasa poder sila\u2014kaya nila itinuloy. Ilang halimbawa pa lang po ito na batid n\u2019yo; napakarami pang iba.\r\nSa ganitong sitwasyon, masisisi ba natin ang mga kababayang lumikas na dahil walang makitang pag-asa?\r\nGaya ninyo, sumagi rin sa isip kong sumuko na lang. Nang pumanaw ang aking ina, lalo pang nabawasan ang ating kumpiyansa; nawala ang aming pinuno at inspirasyon sa pagtutulak ng pagbabago. Sa burol niya, may lumapit sa akin at nagmungkahing tumakbo raw po ako sa pagka-pangulo. Ang sagot ko: Hindi naman ako masokista. Kasama ako sa nagpapahinto ng mga ginawang mali; batid ko ang lubha ng sitwasyon. Tiyak ko ring may mga detalye pang inilihim sa atin, at sadya ngang mas malaki pa sa ating nalalaman ang problema. Nang ako nga po ay tawagin ninyo para maglingkod, ang naging tanong ko: Kung hindi agad malutas ang mga problema, gaano kahaba ang magiging pasensiya ng aking mga Boss, bago nila ibaling ang galit sa akin?\r\nIsa sa mga nakakumbinsi sa akin si Alex Lacson. Ang sabi niya: \u201cSimulan lang ang pagtigil sa pang-aabuso, sapat na. To stop the hemorrhaging would be enough.\u201d\r\nPakinggan po natin siya:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nNoon pa man, alam na nating katiwalian ang ugat ng pagdurusa. Kaya nga, ang sigaw po natin: Kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.\r\nMatinding pagsisikap, tapang, political will, at tiwala sa Diyos at kapwa ang kinailangan upang isabuhay ang kaisipang ito. Siyempre po, ang mga dalubhasa ng lumang kalakaran, hindi maamong tupang papayag na lang matigil ang pagkakataon nilang magsamantala. Ginamit at patuloy nilang ginagamit ang impluwensiya at salapi upang labanan ang agenda ng pagbabago. Ginamit din nila ang poder para maghanda ng mga salbabida sa panahon ng paghuhusga.\r\nAng Ombudsman na itinalaga para bantayan ang katiwalian, diumano\u2019y nagbulag-bulagan sa mga eskandalo ng nakaraang administrasyon. Na-impeach siya sa Kamara, at nagbitiw sa puwesto bago malitis ng Senado. Ang Punong Mahistradong tila ba may pagkiling sa nag-appoint sa kaniya, ay napatunayang naglihim ng yaman at ari-arian sa SALN, na-impeach ng Kongreso at na-convict ng Senado.\r\nKapalit nila, nagtalaga tayo ng mga taong may integridad at sariling pasya. Ang bagong Ombudsman: si Conchita Carpio-Morales. Ang bagong Chief Justice: si Ma. Lourdes Sereno. Ngayon, may sapat na panahon na siyang magpatupad ng reporma sa Hudikatura. [Palakpakan]\r\nPati po sa ibang ahensiya, nagtalaga tayo ng tapat at matatapang na pinuno. Sa COA, agad nating inilagay si Chairperson Grace Pulido-Tan. Sa Ehekutibo naman, nag-appoint din tayo ng mga palaban: si Commissioner Kim Henares sa BIR, at si Secretary Leila de Lima [palakpakan] naman sa Department of Justice. Wala silang inatrasan sa pagtupad ng kanilang tungkulin. Sa inyong lahat, isang taos-pusong pasasalamat.\r\nSa itaas, gitna, o ibaba ng burukrasya, napakarami nang sinuspinde, tinanggal sa puwesto, sinampahan ng kaso, o di kaya\u2019y nasa piitan. Kung may nagdududa pang tunay ngang nakapiring ang katarungan, maganda po sigurong ituon nila ang pansin sa tatlong senador na kasalukuyang naka-detain, at sa dating pangulong naka-hospital arrest.\r\nMay mga magsasabi: Mag-move on na raw tayo. Ako naman po ay naniniwala sa sinabi ni George Santayana: Ang makalimot sa mali ng nakaraan, garantisadong uulitin ito.\r\nTingnan po ninyo ang ginagawa ng mga nagkasala sa atin. Una, ipinapalimot ang kanilang mga nagawa. Pagkatapos, sasabihin nila, \u201cKawawa naman kami.\u201d Sinamantala na nga tayo, sinasamantala pa ang likas nating pagkamaawain, para tuluyang makatakas sa pananagutan. Ang kasunod, gagawa sila ng paraan para makabalik sa poder. Di ba\u2019t iyan naman talaga ang kanilang master plan, upang patuloy pa tayong pagsamantalahan?\r\nNatutuhan ko nga po sa aking mga magulang, sa simbahan, at sa mga proseso ng batas: Anumang paghihilom ay nagsisimula sa pag-amin at pagsisisi ng nagkasala. May naalala ba kayong nagsabing, \u201cSorry sa pagnanakaw at pang-aabuso, handa na akong magbago\u201d? Ang sa akin lang po: Makaka-move on lang tayo kapag nakamtan ang katarungan. [Palakpakan]\r\nNagpatuloy nga po ang pagsasaayos ng mga institusyon, upang muli silang maituon sa tunay nilang mandato. Halimbawa: Sa Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations. Ang mga itinalaga dito, nanumpang pangalagaan ang yaman ng bayan. Ang masakit, maski nalulugi na nga ang mga GOCC, kaliwa\u2019t kanang benepisyo\u2019t insentibo pa ang ipinamudmod nila sa kanilang sarili. Kumbaga sa baka, habang ginagatasan ang institusyon, gusto pang karnehin. Kaya ang dibidendo ng nakaraang administrasyon, P84.18 billion lang sa loob ng siyam at kalahating taon.\r\nSa atin, nabawasan na ang GOCCs sa pagpapasara ng mga nawalan na ng saysay, pero dahil pinatino ang palakad: Umabot na sa P131.86 billion ang dibidendo [palakpakan] sa loob ng limang taon mula nang tayo\u2019y maupo. Hindi nga po malabong bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto ay madodoble na natin ang dibidendo ng ating pinalitan, na mas mahaba ang panahon para mag-ipon. [Palakpakan]\r\nGanitong paninindigan din ang ipinamalas natin sa BIR, na siyang pinakamalaking revenue generating agency ng pamahalaan. Dumating tayong pinakamataas na sa kasaysayan ang P778.6 billion na koleksiyon noong 2008. Tinambakan natin ito. Noong 2012, P1.06 trillion ang nakolekta ng BIR\u2014ang unang pagkakataon sa kasaysayang tumawid ng P1 trilyon ang ating koleksiyon. [Palakpakan]\r\nNitong nakaraang taon, umakyat na ito sa P1.3 trillion, at aabot pa sa P1.5 trillion ang malilikom ngayong 2015. [Palakpakan]\r\nLimang taon lang ang kinailangan para mapantayan, mahigitan, at halos madoble ang pinakamalaking nakolekta ng ating sinundan. Nagawa ito nang tumutupad sa pangakong di magpapataw ng bagong buwis, maliban sa\r\nReform. [Palakpakan]\r\nPaano narating ito? Simple lang po: Ako po\u2019y naniniwalang mabait si Commissioner Kim Henares, pero \u2018yung kaniyang mga kinasuhan ay iba yata ang opinyon. Si Commissioner Kim Henares, walang tax evader na sinanto. Ngayon, 380 kaso na ang naisampa laban sa mga nagtangkang umiwas sa buwis. Ginawa rin niyang episyente ang sistema ng pagbabayad ng buwis, at sinigurong malinaw sa lahat ang kanilang tungkuling makiambag sa pag-angat ng bansa.\r\nSa Pambansang Budget: Sa ilalim ng pinalitan natin, laging reenacted ang bahagi o kabuuan nito. Noong 2007, halimbawa, halos Abril na naaprubahan ang GAA. Masama na po, na ang mga proyektong natapos na ay pinondohang muli. Ang mas malala: Pati ang Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses, kabilang na ang pasahod, ay kasama sa reenacted budget na ito. Ibig sabihin, ang nakasahod na ng unang tatlong buwan ng 2007, pinaglaanan pa ulit ng pondo. Saan kaya napadpad ang mga sobrang ipinagkaloob at hiniling?\r\nAng napatunayan natin: Kung makatwiran ang mungkahi ng Ehekutibo sa budget, maayos ang magiging diyalogo sa mga miyembro ng Kongreso. Agarang maipapasa ang GAA, mas mapapabilis ang pagdating ng serbisyo sa ating mga kababayan, at mas maagang maiibsan ang kanilang paghihirap.\r\nNaging malinaw ang mensahe: Seryoso tayo sa pagbabago; patas ang laban dito. Ang resulta: kumpiyansa sa ating ekonomiya.\r\nNang nagsisimula pa lang tayo, hindi ko inasahang manunumbalik agad ang tiwala ng mundo sa Pilipinas. Ang inisip ko lang po noon: Itigil ang kalokohang umiiral sa sistema, para mahinto ang paglubog ng sitwasyon ng ating kababayang naghihikahos sa kahirapan. Sumagi man lang ba sa isip ninyo na magtutuloy-tuloy ang pag-angat natin sa global competitiveness rankings, at magiging tanyag tayo dahil sa bilis ng paglago ng ating ekonomiya? Ngayon, ang Pilipinas, nabansagan nang \u201cAsia\u2019s Rising Tiger,\u201d \u201cAsia\u2019s Rising Star,\u201d at \u201cAsia\u2019s Bright Spot.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nNgayon nga po, sa kauna-unahang pagkakataon, investment grade na tayo ayon sa mga pinakatanyag na credit rating agencies. Malinaw ang sinasabi nito sa mga negosyante: Sulit mamuhunan sa Pilipinas; nabawasan na ang peligro sa pagnenegosyo dito. Ngayon, mas mababa ang interes at mas mahaba ang panahon ng pagbabayad ng utang, na nakakaengganyo sa mga negosyanteng tumaya sa Pilipinas. Sa pagtatayo at pagpapalawak ng negosyo, sisigla ang kalakalan, lalakas ang kompetisyon, at dadami ang oportunidad. Lahat ito, direktang resulta ng pagsulong ng reporma sa Daang Matuwid. [Palakpakan]\r\nTingnan po natin: Noong 2010, nasa P1.07 billion lang ang net foreign direct investments na pumasok sa ating bansa. Noong 2014, pumalo na ng $6.2 billion ang net foreign direct investments. [Palakpakan] Ito ang pinakamataas na naitala sa ating buong kasaysayan.\r\nPati sa domestic investments, napakasigla ng mga numero; ngayon, ang Pilipino, tumataya sa kapwa Pilipino. Ikumpara natin: Mula nang una itong itala noong 2003 hanggang sa pag-upo natin noong 2010, P1.24 trillion lang ang approved na domestic investments. Mula naman third quarter ng 2010 hanggang 2014, ang ipinasok na puhunan ng ating mga kababayan sa merkado: P2.09 trillion na po. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa manufacturing naman po: Aaminin ko, noong unang nanungkulan tayo, isa sa mga pinakamalaking palaisipan ang pagbabalik ng sigla sa sektor na ito. Humarap sa maraming hamon ang mga industriya: Kuryente pa lang, napakamahal na nga, di pa tiyak. Di rin po biro ang pagtatayo ng pasilidad, dahil malaking puhunan ang kailangan para sa mga makina at pagsasanay ng mga tao. Kaya po ultimo low-tech na electric fan noon, kinailangan na nating angkatin.\r\nDahil sa repormang nagpanumbalik ng kumpiyansa sa ating bansa, lumago ang manufacturing sector. Ang three percent annual average growth ng sektor mula 2001 hanggang 2009, naiangat natin sa eight percent mula 2010 hanggang 2014. [Palakpakan]\r\nMalinaw po: Kaya nang makipagsabayan ng Pilipino. Dati, ang tanging bentahe natin ay ang mababang pasahod sa ating mga manggagawa. Ngayon, dinadala na rin dito ang mga pabrika ng hi-tech na kagamitan: mula sa mga bahagi ng eroplano, mga electric tricycle, mga printer, at iba pang digital media products, hanggang sa high-quality medical devices gaya ng aortic catheter, at gamit para sa in vitro diagnostics at hemodialysis treatment.\r\nPakinggan po natin kung gaano kalinaw ang pagbabago:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nAlam po natin: Ang pangunahing sukatan kung tunay na tumatalab sa karaniwang Pilipino ang pag-unlad ay ang nalilikhang trabaho. Suriin natin ang pagbabago sa aspektong ito.\r\nTaon-taon, mahigit 800,000 ang mga bagong pasok sa ating labor force. Idagdag na rin po natin diyan ang naiulat na pagkaunti ng overseas Filipinos. Noong 2011, nasa 9.51 million ang naitalang overseas Filipinos ng Department of Foreign Affairs. Sa huling datos naman ng Disyembre ng 2014, nasa 9.07 million na lang ito. Hindi kalabisang isiping marami sa tinatayang 440,000 nabawas sa kanila ay bumalik sa Pilipinas, at nakahanap ng trabaho. [Palakpakan]\r\nBagama\u2019t may bagong salta sa merkado, mga balikbayan, at dati nang walang trabaho, ang unemployment rate, bumaba sa 6.8 percent noong nakaraang taon. [Palakpakan] Ito ang pinakamababa sa loob ng isang dekada. Linawin ko rin po: Permanenteng trabaho ang nalikha natin; hindi tayo nag-hire ng magwawalis ng kalsada tuwing survey period lang, para kargahan ang resulta.\r\nKaakibat ng paglikha natin ng trabaho ang maaliwalas na ugnayan ng manggagawa at negosyante. Ikumpara po natin. Noong siyam at kalahating taon ng nakaraang administrasyon, ang natuloy na labor strike: 199, o halos 21 kada taon. Sa limang taon po natin, ang suma-total ng natuloy na strike: 15 na nga lamang po. [Palakpakan] Noon nga pong 2013, ang nag-strike sa buong bansa: isa. Ito ang pinakamababa sa kasaysayan ng DOLE. [Palakpakan]\r\nKaya naman po talagang bilib tayo kay Secretary Linda Baldoz, at sa sektor ng manggagawa at mga nangangasiwa. Si Sec. Linda po, hindi lang magaling; napakadali mo pang katrabaho dahil lagi kang positibo. Ikaw na nga ang tinagurian kong Pastora ng Gabinete. Maraming salamat sa iyo, Linda. [Palakpakan]\r\nTalagang napakalaki na nga po ng pagbabago. Noon, ang mga signage na lagi nating nakikita, di ho ba, \u201cNo Vacancy\u201d? Ngayon, nagkalat ang mga anunsiyong \u201cFor Immediate Hiring\u201d; magbukas ka lang ng diyaryo, makikita sa classified ads ang maraming kumpanyang naghahanap ng maeempleo. Ang iba nga, pagandahan pa ng insentibo. Merong magpa-interview ka lang, ililibre ka na ng almusal. Kapag na-hire naman, sagot na rin nila ang blow-out para ipagdiwang ang bago mong trabaho.\r\nNabanggit nga po sa akin ng ilang negosyante na pahirapan na ngayong makahanap ng accountant. Naalala ko po kasi nung bata ako, maraming kumukuha ng BS Commerce Major in Accountancy. Nang bumisita tayo sa Bicol University, naikuwento ko ito sa kanilang presidente. Tanong ko: Di ba meron kayong accountancy program? Meron daw po, pero kahit sila ay nahihirapang punuin ang sariling accounting department. Bakit? Sabi po kasi ng presidente nila, ang mga estudyante nila, 3rd year pa lang, nire-recruit na ng mga accounting at auditing firms. [Palakpakan]\r\nNagawa po ito dahil sa pagtugon sa tinatawag na job-skills mismatch. Dati, maraming nagsasabing wala silang trabaho, kahit napakarami namang bakanteng posisyong nakatala sa PHIL-JobNet na hindi napupunuan. Ang simpleng dahilan: Hindi tugma ang kakayahan ng ating mga kababayan sa hinahanap ng merkado. Simple lang din po ang solusyon dito: Kausapin ang mga prospective employer, para malaman kung anong klaseng kaalaman ang hinihingi ng mga posisyong binubuksan nila. Dito naman tayo nagsasanay ng trainees, upang masagad nila ang oportunidad.\r\nAng prinsipyo ng ating pamumuno: \u00a0Sa halip na bigyan ang kapwa ng isda, turuan siyang mangisda. Ang pag-unlad at pagkakataon, sinisiguro nating masasagad ng ating mga kababayan. Hindi puwedeng daanin sa trickle down, \u201cbahala na,\u201d o \u201csana\u201d ang pag-abot nito sa mga pinakamahirap. Ang paninindigan po natin: inclusive growth.\r\nAng agenda: ayuda, kaalaman, kasanayan, at kalusugan para walang maiiwan. Ang isa sa mga mekanismo:\r\n.\r\nPinalawak natin nang husto ang saklaw nito. Ngayon, nasa mahigit 4.4 million na ang kabahayang nakikinabang sa programa. [Palakpakan] Malayong-malayo ito sa dinatnan nating 786,523 lamang na kabahayan. Nitong taon, 333,673 ang nagtapos sa high school; kabilang sila sa unang batch ng ating mga benepisyaryo sa pinalawak na Pantawid Pamilya. 13,469 sa kanila ang tumanggap ng honors at iba\u2019t ibang gantimpala. [Palakpakan] Iyon nga pong dalawang benepisyaryong nakilala ko, nakapasok sa quota course na Civil Engineering sa University of the Philippines.\r\nAng lahat po ng benepisyaryong ito, tataas ang antas ng kaalaman; sa halip na menial jobs ang pasukan ay malamang makakuha sila ng mga trabahong maayos ang mga suweldo. Income tax pa lang nila, bawi na ang puhunan ng estado, at maitutuloy natin ang siklo ng pagbibigay-lakas sa mga nangangailangan. Bonus pa po ang lalong magandang kinabukasang nag-aabang para sa mga honor students na pinagtapos ng programa.\r\nPakinggan po natin ang isang natulungan ng Pantawid Pamilya:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nSa Pantawid Pamilya, kapalit ng tulong sa mga benepisyaryo, pangunahin nilang dapat tutukan ang pag-aaral ng mga anak. May paunang bunga na po ito: Ayon sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, noong 2008, mayroong 2.9 million na out-of-school children sa ating bansa. Lumaki ang ating populasyon, pero noong 2013, ang natirang out-of-school children, 1.2 million na lang po. [Palakpakan] Idiin po natin ang diperensiya: 1.7 million. Para po nating pinuno ng estudyante ang humigit-kumulang 42,500 na bakanteng classroom. Siyempre, bukod sa Pantawid Pamilya, may kontribusyon din ang Alternative Learning System para masigurong pati ang mga katutubo at street children ay hindi napapag-iwanan.\r\nMay mga nagtatanong pa nga rin po: Nasaan ang resulta ng Pantawid Pamilya? Sagot po natin diyan, \u201cNaman.\u201d Ang akala kaya nila, itong Pantawid Pamilya ay parang mahiwagang tabletang kapag ininom ng kinder, pagkatapos ng ilang oras ay college graduate na? [Palakpakan at tawanan] Baka po kulang sila ng pagkakataong mag-aral kaya tululungan natin silang magbilang: 13 taon ang\r\n, samantalang anim na taon lang ang aking termino. Nahahalata tuloy kung sino ang medyo matinding mambobola.\r\nAng lakas din ng loob ng ibang ipagsigawan: May leakage daw ang Pantawid Pamilya. \u2018Yun pala, para makapangutya sila, taong 2009 na datos ang ginamit. Paalala lang po: Kalagitnaan ng 2010 nang ako\u2019y naging Pangulo; mukhang ibang pinuno ang dapat nilang singilin sa tinatawag nilang leakage. [Palakpakan] Malamang, pagdating ng panahong ang mga benepisyaryo\u2019y nag-aambag na sa ekonomiya, ang mga tumutuligsa ngayon, mag-uunahang magsabing sila ang ama o ina ng pinalawak na Pantawid Pamilya.\r\nSa sektor naman po ng edukasyon: Sinisiguro nating napupunuan ang mga pagkukulang ng nakaraan, natutugunan ang mga pangangailangang dumarating sa kasalukuyan, at napapaghandaan pati ang para sa kinabukasan.\r\nUnang dalawang taon pa lang natin sa puwesto, naisara na ang dinatnang backlog na 61.7 million textbooks at 2.5 million na upuan. Pagdating ng 2013, ang backlog na 66,800 classrooms, at ang kulang na 145,827 na guro, natugunan na rin sa tulong ng ating local government unit partners. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa estima ng DepEd, mula 2010 hanggang 2017, ang kabuuang bilang ng madaragdag na estudyante: 4.7 million. Bunsod po ito ng pagdami ng enrollees at pagpapatupad natin ng K to 12. Para matugunan ito, kailangan nating magdagdag ng tinatayang 118,000 classrooms. 33,608 dito, naipatayo na. Ngayong taon, nakasalang na ang pagpapagawa ng mahigit 41,000 pa. Ang natitirang 43,000, nakapaloob na sa inaasahan naming ipapasa ninyong 2016 budget. [Palakpakan]\r\nTinatayang 130,000 naman ang kailangan nating guro. Nitong 2014, ang na-hire na ay 29,444. Ngayong taon, ang kabuuang bilang ng guro na target nating ma-hire: 39,000. Ang natitira pang 60,000, nakapaloob na sa panukalang 2016 budget na sana po\u2019y aprubahan n\u2019yo. [Palakpakan] Ayon nga po kay Bro. Armin, ang suma-total ng naipagawa nating mga classroom at na-hire na guro ay higit pa sa pinagsama-samang nagawa mula sa nakalipas na 20 taon bago tayo manungkulan.\r\nNaipamahagi na natin ang karagdagang 73.9 million textbooks, na susundan pa ng 88.7 million ngayong taon. \u00a0Ngayong 2015 din, naihatid na sa mga paaralan ang 1.6 million na upuan, na daragdagan pa uli ng 1.6 million bago matapos ang taon. Sa budget na isusumite natin para sa 2016; nakalagay na ang pondo para sa dagdag pang 103.2 million textbooks, at 4.4 million na upuan. Malinaw po: Hindi na tayo mag-iiwan ng sakit ng ulo sa susunod sa atin. [Palakpakan]\r\nLinawin ko lang po: Nagpatupad tayo ng K to 12 dahil hindi praktikal ang pagsisiksik ng kaalaman sa 10-year basic education cycle. Tandaan lang po ninyo noong tayo\u2019y nag-umpisa, tatatlo na lang tayong bansa na may 10-year basic education sa buong mundo. Kinukuwestiyon na ang credentials ng ating mga kababayan sa ibang bansa; mayroon na ring na-demote, dahil hindi raw sapat na patunay ng kakayahan ang diplomang tangan niya. Kung ang lumang kalakaran sa edukasyon ay maihahalintulad sa manggang kinalburo, ngayon, sinisiguro nating hinog ang kakayahan ng mga estudyante na magpanday ng sariling kinabukasan.\r\nPakinggan po natin ang isang patunay:\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nKung sa tech-voc naman pumasok, nakahanda na rin ang ating pinalakas na mga programa para sa kanila. 7.8 million na ang mga nagtapos sa iba\u2019t ibang kurso ng Technical Vocational Education and Training na pinangasiwaan ng TESDA. Sa Training for Work Scholarship Program lang po, umabot na sa 821,962 ang napagtapos. Ano na kaya ang sitwasyon nila? Ayon sa pag-aaral, 71.9 percent na ang agad nakahanap ng trabaho, kumpara sa 28.5 percent dati. Ang ilang industriya pa nga, talagang pumapalo na dahil 91.26 percent po ang employment rate ng mga nasa semiconductors and electronics industry\u2014konti na lang po, 100 percent na. [Palakpakan]\r\nNaikuwento nga po sa atin ni Sec. Joel Villanueva: May OFW na napilitang umuwi. Akala niya, wala nang pag-asang umasenso. Nag-aral siya ng \u201chilot wellness massage\u201d sa TESDA; ngayon po, apat na ang branch niya ng spa. Naikuwento ko na nga rin noong nakaraang SONA ang isang PWD na dating barker; ngayon, escalation supervisor na siya sa isang BPO. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa Sari-sari Store Training and Access to Resources Program o STAR naman, may isang sari-sari store owner na kumikita dati ng P800 kada araw; ngayon, P4,000 na ang kita niya. Kung susumahin nga po, halos pareho na nga kami ng suweldo ng benepisyaryong ito, [palakpakan at tawanan] kahit hindi parehong stress ang dinadaanan namin. [Tawanan]\r\nPaano nagawa ito? Sinanay siya sa bookkeeping, inventory management, accounting, at iba pa. Talagang bilib po tayo, dahil pati kung paano siguruhing mapupunta sa tama ang dagdag na kita, itinuturo din sa STAR program.\r\nPakinggan po natin ang isa sa mga nakinabang sa programa ng TESDA at ng Coca-Cola:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nDumako naman tayo sa sektor ng kalusugan. Sa maraming Pilipino, sagabal sa pagtupad ng mga pangarap ang pagkakasakit. Ang mga pamilyang umaasenso, back to zero kapag tinamaan ng karamdaman. Nauubos na nga ang ipon, nababaon pa sa utang.\r\nSa\r\npo: Dumating tayong 47 milyong Pilipino lang ang benepisyaryo. Halos dinoble na po natin ito. Nitong Hunyo, pumalo na ang saklaw ng ating PhilHealth sa 89.4 million na Pilipino. [Palakpakan] Ang pagbabago pa nga po: Tuwing eleksiyon, parang kabuteng nagsusulputan ang mga bagong benepisyaryo ng PhilHealth. Imbis kasi na pangangailangan ng taumbayan, interes ng kandidato ang naging basehan. Tinama na natin ang ganyang kalakaran.\r\nHeto pa po. Noong 2012, inanunsiyo natin: Kung kabilang ang pamilya mo sa lowest quintile o ang pinakamahirap na 20 porsiyento ng ating populasyon, at nagpagamot ka sa pampublikong ospital, sigurado, wala kang kailangang bayaran. Simula po noong 2014: Lumawak na iyan para saklawin ang susunod na quintile sa ating lipunan. Ibig sabihin, para sa pinakamahirap na 40 porsiyento, libre na ring magpagamot sa mga pampublikong ospital. Ito po \u2018yung pagkalingang tinatawag ng iba na palpak at manhid. Ang tugon ko po, sabi nga ni Aiza Seguerra noong araw, \u201cI thank you, bow.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nNgayon, pakinggan po natin ang ilan sa mga resulta ng pinaigting na PhilHealth program:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\n____________________\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nMuli po nating balangkasin ang kuwento ng nakaraang limang taon. Hinabol natin ang mga corrupt at nilinis ang sistema, na nanganak ng kumpiyansa po sa ating mga merkado. Pumasok ang negosyo, lumawak ang oportunidad, habang binibigyang-lakas nating magkatrabaho ang Pilipino. Sila ang tumatangkilik ng mga negosyo; ito naman pong mga negosyo, nakikitang meron nang level playing field; naaasahan ang pag-asenso nang hindi kailangang mandaya. Nagpapalawak sila ng operasyon, at umeempleo ng mas maraming tao. Siklo po ito: katarungan, tiwala, paglago ng ekonomiya, pagkakataon, pag-asenso. Boss, ito mismo ang diwa ng \u201cKung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nAt hindi lang natin nakamtan ang pagbabago; ang transpormasyong ating tinatamasa ngayon, lagpas-lagpas pa sa inasahan noong simula.\r\nAng Cadastral Survey, na sinimulan pa noong 1913, tapos na natin. Inabot ng halos isang siglo ang mga nauna sa atin para matapos ang 46 percent nito. Ang mahigit kalahati pong natitira, nabuno natin sa limang taon sa puwesto. Ito pong Cadastral Survey ang tumutukoy sa hangganan ng mga lupaing saklaw ng bawat lungsod, bayan, at lalawigan sa Pilipinas. Sa ARMM, halimbawa, para bang nanganganak ang lupa: Sabi ng mapa, 1.2 million hectares lang ang meron, pero kung susumahin ang idinedeklarang lupa, 3.7-million hectares ang inaabot. Ngayon, dahil naayos na ang land record system, wala nang nanganganak na lupa sa ARMM.\r\nNoong 2011 po, inimbentaryo natin ang mga sitio; tinukoy natin kung sino pa ang nangangailangan ng kuryente. Gawa ng Sitio Electrification Program, nakapaghatid na tayo ng liwanag sa 25,257 sitiong natukoy sa imbentaryong ito. Dagdag pa rito, dahil sa paggamit ng solar at iba pang teknolohiya, kahit malayo o liblib na lugar, nagkakakuryente na rin. Ngayon po, 78 percent na ng target ng SEP ang energized na. At tinitiyak sa atin ng DOE na bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto, lahat ng naitala noong 2011, may kuryente na. [Palakpakan]\r\nTunghayan po natin ang isang magsasakang nakinabang sa ating Sitio Electrification Program.\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nSa aviation naman po, sunod-sunod din ang good news: Ang significant safety concerns na ipinataw ng International Civil Aviation Organization noong 2009, natanggal na noong 2013. Sa parehong taon, pinayagan ng European Union ang ating flag carrier na muling lumipad patungong Europa. Noong 2014 naman, isa pang local carrier ang pinayagan ng European Union, habang inangat na tayo ng U.S. Federal Aviation Administration sa Category 1, mula sa nangyaring pag-downgrade sa Category 2 noong 2008.\r\nDahil dito, dumadami ang flights papasok at palabas ng bansa, at napapadali ang paglipad ng mga turista sa loob ng Pilipinas. Ang maganda pa: Nitong Hunyo, inalis na rin ng EU Air Safety Committee ang travel ban sa lahat ng ating air carrier. Ito po ang unang pagkakataong tinanggal nila ang ban sa buong civil aviation sector ng isang bansa. Ngayon, lahat ng airlines natin, direkta nang makakalipad papuntang United Kingdom, Italy, at iba pang bansang kasapi ng EU.\r\nSa seafaring: 2006 pa lang po, kinuwestiyon na ng European Maritime Safety Agency o EMSA ang ating pagsunod sa Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. Dahil dito, nagkaroon ng bantang hindi kilalanin ng EU ang ating maritime education certificates. Kung hindi tayo umaksiyon, may potensiyal na mawalan ng trabaho ang tinatayang 80,000 marinong Pilipinong naglalayag sa mga barkong Europeo.\r\nAgad na kumilos ang MARINA at DOTC para iayon ito sa mga pandaigdigang pamantayan. Hanggang ngayon, kinikilala pa rin ng EU ang ating mga sertipikasyon. Sa susunod na audit ng EMSA na magsisimula ngayong Oktubre, ang garantiya ng MARINA sa atin: Tiyak, papasa na po tayo. [Palakpakan]\r\nKay Sec. Jun Abaya: Huwag ka sanang panghinaan ng loob kung tila nalilimot ng iba ang nagawa mo para sa ating mga marino, ang pagtanggal ng ICAO sa significant safety concerns sa ating aviation sector, ang pag-alis ng European ban sa ating mga eroplano, at ang pag-akyat natin sa Category 1 ng U.S. Federal Aviation [Administration]. Ipinagbawal mo rin ang pagpapalaot ng barko kapag may bagyo, na nakatulong upang mailayo sa panganib ang pasahero. Bihira na po tayong nakakakita ng balitang parating may barkong lumulubog tuwing may bagyo. Lahat ng ito, naisasantabi dahil sa masalimuot na hamong hinaharap natin sa pampublikong transportasyon. Pinakamalaking halimbawa na nga po ang MRT.\r\nBihira ang nagbabanggit na may katuwang tayong pribadong korporasyon, na naalala ang kanilang mga karapatan, pero tila ba nalimot ang kanilang mga obligasyon. Ang katuwang na ito, sagot ang maintenance. Dapat, noong 2008, nagkaroon ng general overhaul ang MRT, pero nang suriin ng ating Department of Transportation and Communication, halos pagpipintura lang ang pinagawang overhaul. Sa pagwawalang-bahalang ito, parang ginarantiyang masisira ang tren. Di po ba maski sinong kumpanya, dapat sinisigurong masusulit ang kanilang investment? Pero hinayaan lang nilang lumala nang lumala ang sitwasyon hanggang umabot sa puntong ipinasa na sa atin nang ora-orada ang pagsasaayos ng MRT.\r\nNang aayusin na natin, bigla naman silang humirit, sila na lang daw ulit. Pero ang mungkahi nilang pagsasaayos, di-hamak na mas mahal kaysa ating plano. Siyempre, katumbas nito, dagdag na gastos at perwisyo sa taumbayan. Hindi tayo pumayag, at kumilos na nga para makakuha nga ng ayuda tulad ng mga bagong bagon. Ang problema, mapilit ang korporasyon, kaya\u2019t pina-TRO nila ang pagbili nito. Kaya umabot sa ganitong sitwasyon ang MRT.\r\nSecretary Jun: Ikaw, ako, at ang buong Kamaynilaan, hindi natutuwa dito. Ang trabaho ng pribado, ipinasa sa atin. Ang solusyon naman natin, hinarang nila. Malinaw nang hindi magtatagpo ang agenda natin at ng MRTC. Ngayon: Humahakbang na tayo para i-buy-out ang korporasyon. \u2018Pag naayos ito, ang estado na lang ang tanging magdedesisyon.\r\nHabang sumasailalim sa prosesong ito, nagsasagawa na tayo ng agarang maintenance. Paparating na rin ang mga mas malalaki at pangmatagalang solusyon. Sa susunod na buwan, darating na ang prototype ng bagong bagon; \u2018pag pumasa ito sa pagsusuri, mula Enero ay 3 bagon ang sisimulang i-deliver kada buwan hanggang makumpleto ang in-order nating 48. Ongoing na rin ang proseso para sa mga bagong riles, at pag-a-upgrade ng signalling system at automatic fare collection system; inaasahan ang lahat ng ito bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. Ang power supply para sa mga tren, maa-upgrade bago matapos ang 2016. May 12 escalator na ring maaayos bago matapos ang taong ito, habang ongoing na ang procurement para sa rehabilitasyon ng 34 pang escalator at 32 elevator. Ipapaalala ko lang po: Hindi puwedeng laktawan ang proseso sa mga bagay na ito; ayaw na nating maantala ng kaliwa\u2019t kanang demandahan ang atin pong mga hakbang.\r\nMay mga nagsasabi nga pong may blinders daw ako para sa taong matagal na nating kasama sa Daang Matuwid. Ako, mulat sa maganda, pero batid rin natin ang mga hindi maganda. Ako ba ang may blinders, o itong mga pangit lang ang nakikita?\r\nSa Sandatahang Lakas naman: Noong Nobyembre ng 2010, nagkaroon ng panibagong tensiyon sa pagitan ng North at South Korea; pinangambahang magkakaroon ng giyera doon. Kinailangang magsagawa ng plano para ilikas ang lagpas 46,000 na Pilipinong nasa South Korea, pati na ang walong kababayan nating nasa North Korea.\r\nNang tanungin natin ang AFP kung anong asset ang magagamit para sa evacuation, ang sagot nila, may nag-iisang C-130 ang atin pong Air Force. Ano ang pinakamabilis na round trip? Sampung oras. Ang lulan: 100 katao. Kinalkula ko po: Lagpas 46,000 ang Pilipinong dapat ilayo sa gulo; ibig sabihin, sa pinakaepisyenteng kondisyon, 460 round trips ito, na higit sa 4,600 oras o tinatayang halos 200 araw na pagbiyahe. Hindi naman maaasahang kakayanin ito ng lumang C-130. Kung barko naman daw ang ide-deploy, 1,000 katao ang kakayaning iuwi sa isang biyahe. Suwerte na kung abutin ng sampung araw ang roundtrip. Kung natuloy ang gulo, baka tapos na ang putukan, di pa tayo nakakapaglikas nang husto. Kumilos tayo agad para matugunan ang mga limitasyon nating ito ng sitwasyon natin noon hanggang sa kasalukuyan.\r\nNgayon, ang dating nag-iisang C-130 na nagagamit natin, tatlo na, at target nating makakuha ng dalawa pa. May kasama na rin sila; nariyan na ang una sa tatlo nating binili nating C-295 medium lift transports at paparating na po ngayong taon ang dalawang kapatid nito. Asahan na rin natin ang dalawa pang C-212 light lift transports bago matapos ang 2015. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung patong-patong na pagsubok ang ating kakaharapin, gaya noong nangyari noong 2013, kailangan din natin ng mas marami at mas malalaking assets. Nang tumama si\r\n, nasira ang mga daungan; naging limitado ang kakayahan nating magdala ng ayuda. Sa ganitong pagkakataon, mahalaga ang tinatawag na landing craft utility na puwedeng dumaong sa dalampasigan. Ngayon, magiging sampu na ang dinatnan nating apat na landing craft utility: Mayroon na tayong BRP\r\n. Sa mga susunod na linggo, darating din ang dalawang Landing Craft Heavy mula sa Australia; napakagalante nga po ng pagkakabigay nito, pati spare parts at generator kasama. Target pa nating bilhin ang tatlo; inaayos na natin ang papeles upang sumulong na ang proseso. Dahil sa mga ito, kapag panahon ng sakuna, mababawasan ang pangangailangan nating umasa sa kawanggawa ng ibang bansa. Mas mapapabilis ang paghahatid sa iba\u2019t ibang panig ng Pilipinas ang ayuda, supplies, at iba pang naglalakihang equipment gaya ng bulldozer na kinakailangan para sa clearing at relief operations. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung pagtatanod sa ating teritoryo naman ang pag-uusapan, ang F5 fighter jet na niretiro noong 2005, mapapalitan na ng 12 na bagong FA-50 fighter. Sa Disyembre lalapag ang unang dalawang unit niyan, at makukumpleto naman ang delivery pagdating ng 2017. Nariyan na rin ang mga barkong pandigma na BRP\r\nat\r\n, pito sa 13 na in-order nating AW-109 helicopters, anim sa walong Bell-412 helicopters, 617 na troop carrier trucks, at 50,629 assault rifles. Target din nating makuha ang dalawa pang frigates, anim na Close Air Support Aircraft, 142 armored personnel carriers, at iba pang makabagong kagamitan gaya ng 49,135 units ng force protection equipment, 2,884 na grenade launchers, at karagdagang 23,622 na assault rifles. [Palakpakan] Sa kabuuan po, may 56 na tayong proyektong natapos para sa modernisasyon, at may 30 pa tayong inaprubahan; ikumpara ninyo ito sa 45 na proyektong natapos ng tatlong administrasyong nauna sa atin.\r\nPakinggan natin ang isa sa mga kawal ng ating Air Force:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nSa kapulisan naman, sa unang pagkakataon sa ating kasaysayan, ang bawat pulis, may sarili nang baril. Para naman lalong malinang ang \u00a0kakayahang mag-\u201cshoot, scoot, and communicate\u201d ng ating kapulisan, naipamahagi na ang unang 302 patrol jeeps, na bahagi ng kabuuang 2,523 na pino-procure na natin. Ipinamahagi na rin ang 179 sa 577 na bagong utility vehicles. Naipagkaloob na rin natin ang 12,399 na handheld radios. Nagpo-procure na rin tayo ng 30,136 na long firearms, 3,328 investigative kits, at dagdag pa ring 16,867 na radyo. Pakinggan po natin kung paano ito nakakatulong sa trabaho ng ating kapulisan:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nKakambal po ng kagamitan ang estratehiya nating \u201cwork smarter.\u201d Isinasabuhay ito ng\r\nna sinimulang ipatupad sa Metro Manila. Pinag-aralan natin ang modus ng mga kriminal, at estratehikong dineploy [deploy] ang ating kapulisan. Kaya nga po nahuhuli ang mga \u201cbig fish\u201d na nagmamando sa mga gang, nabubuwag ang mga sindikato, at bumaba ang krimen sa bansa.\r\nSa loob ng ating termino, halos 163,000 na wanted na ang nahuli ng PNP; higit 1,000 na gang naman po ang na-neutralize, at 29,294 na baril na walang lisensiya ang nakumpiska sa buong bansa. Sa NCR po: Mula Enero hanggang Hunyo ng 2014, nasa 37 ang kaso ng murder at homicide kada linggo. Dahil sa Oplan Lambat-Sibat, bumaba na ito sa 23 kaso kada linggo nitong Hunyo. Sa robbery, theft, at carnapping naman para sa parehong panahon: nasa 444 na lang ang lingguhang average sa NCR, mula sa dating 919.\r\nNitong nakaraang linggo lang, nahuli na si Dexter Balane, na lider ng robbery and holdup group na kasabwat ng Martilyo gang. Nariyan din ang kilabot na mag-asawang Tiamzon, si Kumander Parago, at ilan pang kadre ng CPP-NPA-NDF gaya nina Ruben Saluta at Emmanuel Bacarra; ang napakailap na si Jovito Palparan, pati na ang mga lider ng BIFF na sina Basit Usman, Mohammad Ali Tambako, Abdulgani Esmael Pagao, at ang international terrorist na si Marwan. [Palakpakan]\r\nKita po ninyo: Kinakalinga ng Estado ang unipormadong hanay, at sinusuklian nila ito. Sabay ng bagong gamit, itinaas natin ang combat pay ng mga sundalo at subsistence allowance ng buong unipormadong hanay. Nakapagpatayo na rin tayo ng higit 57,000 housing units para sa kanila; aabot pa ito sa mahigit 81,000 bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. [Palakpakan] Sa mga kampo naman, mayroon tayong mga programang pangkabuhayan, at kasama na sa mga nakikinabang dito ang mga kawal na nasugatan o nabaldado sa paggawa ng tungkulin. Upang magkaroon ng partikular na tuon sa kanila, inatasan ko na po ang AFP na makipag-ugnayan sa Gabinete, upang magsagawa ng mga inisyatibang titiyak na magkakaroon ng disenteng pamumuhay ang mga nagsasakripisyo para sa bayan. [Palakpakan]\r\nDumako naman po tayo sa imprastruktura. Naaalala ko po noong Congressman ako sa segundo distrito ng Tarlac: \u2018Pag tag-araw, maladisyerto ang Tarlac River. \u2018Pag umuulan naman, rumaragasa ang ilog, at kasama sa napipinsala ang MacArthur Highway. Tinanong natin, sino ba ang in-charge sa flood control sa aming distrito? Lumapit kami sa Pampanga River Delta Project noon; ang sabi po nila, \u2018yung Lower Agno Project daw ang may saklaw nito. Pagpunta naman namin doon, pinabalik kaming Pampanga. Kaysa tulungan kami, nagturuan lang sila.\r\nTapos na ang panahon ng pag-iwas sa responsibilidad. Sa Daang Matuwid, isa-isang naipatayo ang imprastrukturang matagal nang hinintay ng Pilipino. Nabanggit ko na ang ilan dito: Nariyan ang Lullutan Bridge sa Isabela, na dalawang dekadang hinintay ng mga kababayan natin doon, tulad ni Rodito Albano; [palakpakan] ngayon, nabuksan na. Ang Jalaur River Multi-Purpose Project sa Iloilo, naisip ipatayo noong taong isinilang ako; nag-groundbreaking na po tayo para sa stage 2 nito. [Palakpakan] Ang Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project Phase 2 sa Tarlac, 1980s pa po plinano; ngayon, aprubado na ito, at nagsisimula na ang proseso ng bidding.\r\nAng Basilan Circumferential Road, taong 2000 pa sinimulang ipatayo, pero matagal nabinbin dahil sa kaguluhan sa lalawigan. Hinahadlangan ng masasamang elemento ang pagpapatayo nito, dahil oras na ito\u2019y maipagawa, magiging mas mahirap ang kanilang pagtakas sa batas; mapapabilis rin ang pagdating ng serbisyo, kaya\u2019t hihina ang impluwensiya nila sa mga kababayan natin doon. Ngayon, tatlong tulay na lang ang tinatapos sa kahabaan nito, pero ang malaking bahagi, dinadaanan na. [Palakpakan]\r\nNabanggit ko na po ang Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway na binuksan noong Biyernes. Bukas na rin ang unang dalawang bahagi ng Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway o TPLEX. Ang Phase 2 naman ng STAR Toll, tapos na rin. Kapag nabuo pa ang Cavite-Laguna Expressway Project, ang C-6 Phase 1, ang Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, at ang NLEX-SLEX Connector Road, lalong magiging malawakan ang benepisyo ng ating estratehiyang pang-imprastruktura. [Palakpakan]\r\nPara po tugunan ang pagbaha, mayroon din tayong pagsasaayos at maintenance ng flood control projects. Ilan sa mga ito ang Pasig-Marikina River Channel Improvement Project Phase 2, na natapos noong 2013; ang high impact flood control projects para sa NCR at mga karatig-bayan, matatapos na sa Nobyembre, at target naman nating makumpleto ang Blumentritt Interceptor Catchment Area sa susunod na taon. Ang Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike naman, ia-award na rin sa Disyembre.\r\nTiyak ko pong batid ng lahat: Hindi batayan kung kapartido ang pinuno sa lalawigan, o kung nanalo tayo doon; ang tanging tanong natin: May pangangailangan ba? Hayaan po nating magsalita ang ilan sa atin pong mga natulungan:\r\n____________________\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nKay Governor Bulut, ika-20 ako sa puso ninyo noong Senatorial election noong 2007, ikaapat naman ako noong Presidential elections. Sa mga ipinapatayong estruktura, di naman siguro ninyo masasabing malayo kayo sa puso ko at puso ng ating mga kababayan. Kayo na rin ang testigo: Sa pagkakaroon ng proyekto, hindi boto ang basehan, kundi dapat, pangangailangan. [Palakpakan]\r\nKay Congresswoman Alvarez naman, na ilang beses na nga pong nagpo-posing nang nakahiga sa mga kalsadang nakumpleto natin: Pasensiya na, Chedeng, pero sa susunod na humiga ka sa kalsada, ipapahuli na kita. Obstruction of traffic ang violation mo. [Tawanan at palakpakan]\r\nMalinaw ang ating estratehiya: Sa pagpapagawa ng mga kalsada, tulay at iba pang estruktura, iniibsan natin ang dapat ibsan, at pinapabilis ang paghahatid ng benepisyo. Ang panawagan ko nga po: Makiambag sana tayong lahat, at maging handang magsakripisyo.\r\nHalimbawa: Para matugunan ang madalas na pagbaha sa Maynila, isinulong natin ang pagpapagawa ng catchment area; pero tumutol po dito ang isang malaking unibersidad. May lumang mga gusali daw kasi silang baka maapektuhan ng gagawing proyekto. Isa pa po: Kailangan nang i-retrofit ang Guadalupe Bridge dahil maaari itong bumigay kapag lumindol. Puwede bang isara ang tulay na ito, nang dadaloy pa rin ang trapiko sa EDSA? Kaya nga hindi puwedeng ipagawa na lang ang tulay nang basta-basta. Para magawa ito, kailangan ng alternatibong daan. May mungkahi at tinatayang 70,000 ang kayang dumaan kada araw dito. Kung magawa ito, ito pong tulay na alternatibo at parallel sa Guadalupe, mapapagawa na ang Guadalupe. Kaya lang po, sa rutang pinili, may mga grupong diumano\u2019y tumututol. Sang-ayon silang maayos ang Guadalupe, sang-ayon silang lumuwag ang EDSA, kung nagkaroon ng panibagong tulay, basta raw ang proyekto, huwag sa kanila itatayo nang hindi sila maabala. Kung ganito nga po ang pananaw, talagang maaantala ang pagpapatayo ng kinakailangan nating imprastruktura.\r\nMay mga pagkakataon din pong hindi na nga tayo tinulungan, naglagay pa ng balakid ang nasa lokal na antas. Halimbawa po, may tinamaan ng sakuna. Agad-agad tayong pumunta; sinalubong ako ng Congressman at ng Mayor, pero ang kumausap sa akin, [City] Administrator at Vice Mayor. Ang sabi natin, meron nang kagamitan ang DPWH, at handa na kaming itayo ang temporary shelter n\u2019yo; kailangan na lang ng lupang pagtatayuan. Ang sagot nila, mayroon daw 30 ektaryang puwedeng gamitin. Ang masakit, pagbalik ko, walang kahit anong ibinahagi dahil may paggagamitan daw sila.\r\nIsang horror story lang po iyan. Ang atin po: Kami ay nandito para tumulong. Ipipilit namin ang ayuda hangga\u2019t kaya at naaayon sa batas. Kung ayaw nilang makipagtulungan, ang masasabi ko na lang po: Eleksiyon na sa susunod na taon, at ang mga Boss natin ang huhusga kung sino ang nakabawas o nagpalala ng pagdurusa. [Palakpakan]\r\nTumungo naman po tayo sa Public Private Partnerships. Kapag pinagsama natin ang solicited PPP projects ng nakaraang tatlong administrasyon, ang suma-total: anim na proyekto. Sa atin, may 50 proyekto na: Ang sampu dito, awarded na; ang 13, nasa bidding; habang 27 naman ang nakapila pa. Kayo na po ang magkumpara sa pagkakaiba.\r\nDati, walang nakikisali sa proyekto, ngayon, nag-uunahan na ang mga pribadong kumpanya, at nagbibigay ng premium. Suma-total, ang primang natanggap natin mula sa mga kumpanyang katuwang sa PPP, umabot na sa P64.1 billion, na napupunta naman sa kaban ng ating bayan. [Palakpakan] Kada matagumpay na proyekto, magbubunsod din ng higit na kumpiyansa, na siyang magpapabilis sa pagpapatayo natin ng iba pang kinakailangang imprastruktura. Ang pagtitiis ng ating mga Boss, maiibsan, kundi man matatapos na.\r\nPara naman sa imprastrukturang paparating pa lang, hihilingin ko rin: Kalma lang po tayo. Ang procurement, mabilis na ang apat na buwan para makumpleto. Suwerte ka na kung ang in-order mong computer, mai-deliver sa loob ng panahong iyan. Paano pa kaya kung pagpapatayo ng tulay ang pinag-uusapan?\r\nAng sa akin nga po: Di na baleng hindi ako ang mag-groundbreaking o ribbon-cutting. Ang mahalaga: Gawing pulido at naaayon sa batas ang mga proyekto, para oras na maaprubahan ito, dire-diretso ang pagpapatupad; maski sino ang sumuri, papasa ang kalidad ng ating ipinatatayo. Alam po ito ng ating Gabinete: Sa Cabinet o NEDA Board meeting, minsan na akong nagbirong dapat magdala ng kumot ang mga dadalo, dahil tiyak na gagabihin kami. Personal ko kasing sinisiyasat ang detalye, para \u2018pag iniharap ito sa ating mga Boss, sasabihin din nilang, \u201cAprub kami, dahil nakikita naming tapat ang proseso at tiyak ang pakinabang sa proyekto.\u201d\r\nNapakalaki na po talaga ng pagbabago. Noon ang Pilipino, naglaho ang pag-asa. Ngayon naman po: Sa pinakahuling SWS survey, lumabas na walo sa bawat sampung Pilipino ang tiwalang magiging kahanay, kundi man kahanay na, ang Pilipinas sa \u201cdeveloped countries.\u201d [Palakpakan] Mayroon din pong survey ng Gallup, Inc. Alam po n\u2019yo, isa [ito] sa pinakamatanda at iginagalang na polling agency sa mundo. Tinanong nila ang mamamayan sa 145 na bansa, \u201cWould you say that now is a good time or a bad time to find a job?\u201d Lumabas po na ang Pilipinas ang may pinakamataas na job optimism sa buong Asya-Pasipiko, at pangalawa sa buong mundo. [Palakpakan]\r\nKumpiyansa nga po ang ating mga kababayan sa estabilidad ng kanilang kinabukasan. Ngayon, maski bagong pasok pa lang sa trabaho ay nakakapaghulog na para sa sariling sasakyan o condo unit. Di na nakakagulat na nitong nakaraang taon, tumaas ng 27 percent ang car sales sa Pilipinas. Ang paniniwala ngayon: Kayang-kaya nang bayaran, di lang ang down payment, kundi maging ang monthly amortization. Sa dami ng nakakapagpundar ng bagong sasakyan, dalawa po sa pinakamalaking kompanyang nagbebenta sa Pilipinas ay inaabot ng dalawa\u2019t kalahati hanggang tatlong buwan bago makapag-deliver ng kotse. Sa sarili ko pong karanasan, noong una akong nagkatrabaho, kinalkula ko kung gaano katagal bago ako makaipon para sa sariling kotse. Dalawampung taon lang naman po ang aabutin, segunda mano pa.\r\nNakausap din po natin ang mga pinuno ng dalawang malaking kumpanya; ang isa, mayroon nang mga pabrika dito habang ang isa pa ay gusto ring pumasok. Pareho po silang nagpahayag ng interes na magtayo ng research and development facilities dito po sa ating bansa. Nakita nila ang potensiyal at talento ng Pilipinong makatulong upang mapanatili ang kanilang magandang posisyon sa merkado. Ang tanong nila: Kaya ba nating mag-supply ng daan-daang empleadong may masteral at doctoral degrees sa engineering? Ang tugon ng mga kaibigan natin sa DOST: Kayang-kaya. Sabi ko pa po, kung may magbubukas na trabaho sa high-tech na industriya, baka makapagpauwi pa tayo ng mga OFW, na papayag naman sigurong tumanggap ng mas mababang sahod kung mapapalapit sila sa kanilang pamilya. Ang sabi ng mga kausap natin: Hindi kailangang babaan, dahil handa silang tapatan ang suweldo nitong mga kababayan nating ito. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa sektor din po ng pangingisda, nadarama ang pagbabago sa pagtingin sa Pilipino. Nitong Abril, tinanggal na ng European Commission ang ipinataw nilang yellow card sa Pilipinas. Dahil hindi raw ho dati maayos ang dokumentasyon at tracking, di sila makasigurong nahuli ang mga isda sa legal na paraan. Agad tayong kumilos ang Department of Agriculture upang hindi mapasama sa blacklist ng EU, at hindi mapagbawalang magluwas ng produkto sa kanila. Nang magtungo nga po si Secretary Procy Alcala sa Belgium, sabi sa kanya, huwag daw sasama ang kanyang loob, dahil baka tanungin tayo ng ibang bansang may yellow card pa. Tayo raw kasi ang makakapagturo sa kanila kung ano ang mga dapat gawin para maresolba ang problema. [Palakpakan]\r\nNaalala ko rin po, noong una, pakiramdam ko, kinakausap lang tayo ng ibang pinuno dahil obligado silang kausapin tayo. May ilang halos sermonan tayo nang una nating nakahalubilo. Ngayon, kaliwa\u2019t kanan ang imbitasyon para sa State Visit, may kasama pang papuri. Nakikiusap pa ang iba: Kahit raw dumating tayo sa umaga at umalis din ng tanghalian, basta\u2019t pumunta tayo, ikatutuwa na nila iyon. Nagulat po talaga ako nang minsang may pinuno ng isang pinakamaunlad na bansa, at ang tanong po sa atin, \u201cAno ba ang inyong sekreto?\u201d Siyempre po, dahil hindi tayo mahilig magbuhat ng sariling bangko, sinagot ko na lang po sa kanya: \u201cAng sikreto po namin ay sinunod lang namin ang mabuti ninyong halimbawa.\u201d Meron din namang nagtatanong sa atin at maging sa ating mga delegasyon: \u201cAng ganda ng nangyayari sa Pilipinas; anim na taon lang ba talaga ang termino ninyo? Wala na bang puwedeng magawa dito?\u201d Ang lagi nga po nating tugon, \u201cNagkaroon kami ng pangulo na talagang gumawa ng paraang manatili sa puwesto. Kailangan naming tiyaking di mabubuksan ang pinto para maulit ito.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nSiyempre po, kahit kaliwa\u2019t kanan na ang ebidensiya ng pagbabago, mayroon pa ring kontra sa Daang Matuwid. Ang hirit nila: Mabagal daw tayo. Kapag sila raw ang naging Pangulo, sigurado, gaganda ang buhay. Sa mga medyo may edad po, ang isasagot dito, \u201cAh, ganun?\u201d sabay taas ng kilay. Para naman sa kabataan, iba na raw po ang tugon nila sa ganoong pahayag, iba na daw po ang uso ngayon eh: E di wow. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng tanong natin: Paano nila gagawin ang mga pangakong iyan? Ang sagot nila: Basta. Nasaan ang detalye at kongkretong mga plano? Basta. Paano ninyo ipatutupad ang inyong mga pangako? Basta. Pakiramdam yata nila nadadaan sa basta-basta ang solusyon sa ating mga problema.\r\nWala pa rin talagang gamot na naiimbento para sa mga nagbubulag-bulagan at nagbibingi-bingihan. [Palakpakan] Ang payo ko nga po: Maganda siguro, kapag ganitong harapan nang iniinsulto ang talino ng Pilipino, ilipat muna natin ang channel, at baka may mas mapala pa tayo sa panonood ng sitcom.\r\nNgayon naman po, may ilang mga batas na nais kong ilapit upang sana\u2019y maipasa sa loob ng kasalukuyang Kongreso:\r\nPangunahin siyempre po dito: Ang\r\n. [Palakpakan] Sa mga tutol sa batas na ito: Palagay ko, obligasyon ninyong magmungkahi ng mas magandang solusyon. Kung wala kayong alternatibo, ginagarantiya lang ninyong hindi maaabot ang pagbabago. Ilang buhay pa ang kailangang ibuwis para magising ang lahat sa obligasyong baguhin ang sirang status quo sa Muslim Mindanao?\r\nPakinggan po natin ang ilan sa mga maaaring makinabang sa batas pong ito:\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\n____________________\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nInilalapit din po natin sa Kongreso ang Rationalization of Fiscal Incentives. Kung maipapasa ito, maitatama ang papatsa-patsang sistema ng pagbibigay insentibo at magiging mas makatwiran ang pagbubuwis sa mga negosyo. Hinihiling rin namin ang agarang pagtutok sa Unified Uniformed Personnel Pension Reform Bill, para tuluyang maisulong ang isang makatarungang sistemang pampensiyon para sa kanila. Agaran po sanang maipasa ang batas na ito, dahil ngayon pa lang, trilyong piso na ang kakailanganin para pondohan ang pensiyon ng unipormadong hanay. Kailangan ng awtorisasyon ng batas para matugunan ang masalimuot na sitwasyong ito.\r\nBukas na bukas naman po ay makakarating na sa inyo ang panukalang budget para sa susunod na taon. Hindi pa po tayo nabibigong ipasa ito sa tamang oras; umaasa nga po ako, na mapapanatili ang tamang kalakarang ito ngayong nasa huling yugto na tayo ng ating administrasyon. [Palakpakan]\r\nNaaalala ko rin po: Kumontra akong pagkaitan ang isang tao ng karapatang tumakbo sa puwesto, dahil lang sa kanyang apelyido. Bakit nga naman tayo gagawa ng batas para pigilang maglingkod ang gustong maglingkod?\r\nPero napapaisip po ako: May mali rin sa pagbibigay ng pagkakataong habambuhay na magpakasasa sa kapangyarihan ang isang tiwaling pamilya o indibidwal. Ganyang kaisipan din ang dahilan kung bakit, noong may nagmungkahing manatili pa ako sa puwesto\u2014kahit raw dagdag na tatlong taon lang\u2014ako mismo ang tumutol dito. Di tayo makakasiguro kung malinis ang intensiyon ng mga susunod, o kung nanaisin lang nilang habambuhay na maghari-harian para sa sariling interes. Panahon na para ipasa ang isang Anti-Dynasty Law. [Palakpakan]\r\nDahil sa Kongreso, naipasa ang mga batas na kikilalanin bilang haligi ng transpormasyong sinisimulan natin ngayon. Sa Kamara at Senado, lalo na sa mga kasapi ninyong naging kabalikat sa Daang Matuwid nitong mga nagdaang taon: Salamat sa\r\n, sa Act Allowing the Full Entry of Foreign Banks, [palakpakan] at sa pag-amyenda sa\r\n. Salamat sa Sin Tax Reform Act. Salamat sa\r\n. [Palakpakan] Salamat sa lahat ng iba pang makabuluhang batas na inyong ipinasa. Tunay nga pong napakalaki ng naiambag ng isang Kongresong determinadong maging katuwang sa pagsusulong ng pagbabago. [Palakpakan]\r\nKanina po, minabuti kong pag-usapan kung saan tayo nagmula upang bigyang-konteksto ang mga hamong hinarap, hinaharap, at haharapin pa natin. Lahat po ng batikos, panlalait, at pang-aalipusta, tinanggap ko bilang kakabit ng pagkakataon at karangalang pagsilbihan kayo. Pero ang totoo, hindi ko ito pinasan nang mag-isa. Hinihingi ko po ang oras ninyo para pasalamatan ang mga naging inspirasyon at katuwang; maunawaan po sana ng iba kung hindi ko sila mababanggit.\r\nUnang-una po, siyempre, ang Panginoong Maykapal na sa bawat sandali ay ginabayan ang ating bansa. Sa aking ama at ina, [palakpakan] na sa paglaban sa pang-aabuso at sa pagsasakripisyo ay naging bukal ng inspirasyon, hindi lang sa aming pamilya, kundi maging sa sambayanan;\r\nSa atin pong Gabinete, na nabanggit ko na ang ilan sa kanila kanina; hayaan po ninyo akong magpatuloy:\r\nUnang-una, kay Executive Secretary Jojo Ochoa, na tinaguriang Little President. [Palakpakan] Sa mga magulang pa natin nag-umpisa ang matibay nating pag-uugnayan. Nagdamayan tayo sa maraming hamon sa buhay. Ang private practice mo, nasakripisyo sa mahabang panahong naglingkod ka, una sa Quezon City man o sa aking administrasyon. Lahat ng nalalaman mo sa batas, ibinahagi mo sa akin. Hindi mo ako iniwan, kahit sa mga panahong may banta sa ating buhay. Pare, mapalad akong nagkakilala tayo, naging magkaibigan, at magkasangga sa paglilingkod sa ating mga Boss; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Rene Almendras, na kabalikat ni ES Ochoa at naturingang bastonero ng Gabinete: Sabi nga ng iba, dati ang kinis pa ng noo mo, ngayon nagmistula nang humps sa barangay dahil sa pakikisalo mo sa mga kailangan nating harapin;\r\nKay Secretary Albert del Rosario: [palakpakan] nanumpa ng Biyernes; pagdating ng Linggo, nasa Libya na para pamunuan ang evacuation ng mga OFW na nalagay sa peligro noong panahon ng Arab Spring. Di ko kailanman pinoproblema ang pag-motivate sa iyo; at kung may debate man tayo, nangyayari lang dahil inaawat kita sa pagbiyahe sa pinakamapapanganib na lugar sa mundo;\r\nKina Secretary Cesar Purisima at Arsi Balisacan: [palakpakan] Pinalad ang bansa sa tandem ninyo. Mula sa big picture, hanggang sa pinakamaliit na detalye, kayo ang nagsisigurong nadadama ng bawat Pilipino ang pag-unlad ng ating ekonomiya. [Palakpakan] Siyempre, ang ilan sa malalaking patunay nito, nagawa sa tulong ni Usec. Cosette Canilao at ng lahat ng bumubuo sa ating PPP center; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Greg Domingo, ang ating pambansang salesman na umakit sa mga negosyanteng mamuhunan sa bansa, [palakpakan] at kay PEZA Director General Lilia de Lima. Inutusan ko na po ang DOST sa pagko-clone kay Lilia de Lima.\r\nKay Secretary Babes Singson, ang prayer leader ng Cabinet, [palakpakan] tagapagtatag ng mga kongkretong patunay ng transpormasyon, at nagbalik ng tiwala ng taumbayan sa DPWH;\r\nKay Secretary Mon Jimenez, [palakpakan] isa sa pinakapinagkakatiwalaan nating boses sa Gabinete. Talagang \u201cIt\u2019s more fun in the Philippines,\u201d at dahil nga sa pagsisikap mo, umabot sa 4.8 million ang turistang dumalaw sa bansa at direktang lumikha ng trabaho; nagpapasalamat din ako sa kanyang maybahay na si Abby, na tinulungan tayong ilagay sa imahen at salita ang agenda ng positibong pagbabago;\r\nKay dating Energy Secretary Icot Petilla, na kahit wala na sa aking opisyal na pamilya ay nakikiambag pa rin; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Volts Gazmin, [palakpakan] na nagtitimon sa ating Sandatahang Lakas at sinisigurong lagi tayong handa sa sakuna: Kailanman ay hindi mo kami binigyan ng dahilang mangamba;\r\nKay Secretary Cesar Garcia, ang ating National Security Adviser, na kahit kakaopera pa lang sa tuhod ay napakabilis sumagot sa aking mga text;\r\nKay Secretary Janette Garin, [palakpakan] na sumalubong sa MERS,\r\n, food poisoning, encephalitis, at sa sunod-sunod na mga banta sa ating kalusugan. Janette, ang katatagan mo ang nagpapatatag sa ating lahat;\r\nKay Secretary Dinky Soliman, [palakpakan] na on-call 25 hours a day, 8 days a week, idamay ko na rin lahat ng iyong naging executive assistants, na pagka-graduate sa DSWD ay puwede nang isabak sa anumang krisis sa buong mundo. Dinky, tuwing tatawagin kita ay laging hawak mo na ang tala ng problemang dapat tugunan, ang mga ginagawang hakbang, at ang mga natitira pang dapat gawin. Isang usapan lang, malinaw nang inaasikaso mo ang lahat ng dapat asikasuhin; [palakpakan]\r\nSa mga nagtitiyak na may sapat na kaalaman at kakayahan ang susunod na henerasyon, sina Secretaries Armin Luistro, Tatti Licuanan, at Joel Villanueva; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Mario Montejo, na tumulong magbalik ng pag-asa sa PAGASA, at talagang nagsikap upang iparamdam ang papel ng agham sa pagpapaunlad ng bansa; [palakpakan]\r\nKina Secretaries Procy Alcala at Kiko Pangilinan, na nagbubunga na ang repormang ipinunla sa sektor ng agrikultura; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Gil de los Reyes, na hindi natitinag sa pagsulong ng makatarungang repormang agraryo, gaano man kasalimuot ang hamong hinaharap; [palakpakan]\r\nKina Secretaries Ramon Paje, Neric Acosta, at Lucille Sering na ipinakitang nakatali ang malawakang kaunlaran sa pangangalaga ng ating likas na yaman; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Mar Roxas: Nasa loob o labas ka man ng gobyerno, [palakpakan] hindi tumigil sa panlalait sa iyo ang mga kalaban ng Daang Matuwid. Dahil nga may bilang ka, dahil talagang may ibubuga ka, nagpupursigi silang ibagsak ka. Palibhasa hindi nila kayang iangat ang sarili, kaya pilit ka nilang ibinababa. [Palakpakan] Sa patuloy nilang paninira, ang mga kritiko mo na rin ang nagpapatunay na takot sila sa angkin mong integridad, husay, at kahandaan sa trabaho. Mar, pinatutunayan mo: You can\u2019t put a good man down. [Palakpakan] Tulad ng pagtitiwala ng nanay at tatay ko, magtiwala kang alam ng taumbayan kung sino ang tunay na inuuna ang bayan, bago ang sarili; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Butch Abad, [palakpakan] na kahit pa ba pinaulanan ng di-makatarungang paratang ay patuloy sa pagsigurong ang pera ng bayan ay mapupunta sa taumbayan lamang;\r\nKina Secretaries Edwin Lacierda at Sonny Coloma, dating Secretary Ricky Carandang, at kina Usec. Abi Valte at Manolo Quezon: [palakpakan] dama ko ang bigat ng pinasan ninyo sa pagsagot sa lahat ng uri ng tanong\u2014may saysay man o wala\u2014para maiparating sa ating mga kababayan ang angkop at tamang impormasyon;\r\nKina Solicitor General Florin Hilbay at Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Ben Caguioa, [palakpakan] na ipinakita ang karangalan at katapatang angkop sa pagiging mga pangunahing abugado ng Ehekutibo;\r\nKay Secretary Ging Deles, kasama na si Chair Iye Coronel-Ferrer, na walang kapagurang isinusulong ang isang mapayapang Pilipinas; [palakpakan]\r\nKay Secretary Julia Abad, na sinisigurong matututukan ko ang lahat ng aking responsibilidad; [palakpakan] sa iyo ako bumabaling para sa agarang aksiyon kaya madalas, ikaw din ang sumasalo ng una kong reaksiyon. Sa kabila nito, lagi ka pa ring cheerful;\r\nSa iba pang Kalihim na sumasagot ng telepono kahit madaling-araw tawagan: Yasmin Busran-Lao, Francis Tolentino, Lu Antonino, Joel Rocamora, Mely Nicolas, Ronald Llamas, Cesar Villanueva, at Manny Mamba; [palakpakan]\r\nSa mga hindi kasapi ng Gabinete, pero nakipanday sa Daang Matuwid: Si Governor Say Tetangco, na napakahusay ng pangangasiwa sa Bangko Sentral;\u00a0[palakpakan] \u00a0si Governor Mujiv Hataman ng ARMM; [palakpakan] si Chito Cruz ng National Housing Authority; [palakpakan] si Gerry Esquivel ng MWSS; [palakpakan] at isama ko na rin po si Chairman Bong Naguiat ng PAGCOR na hindi bumili ng kape; [palakpakan]\r\nSa mga dating naglingkod sa Gabinete na talagang nagpakitang-gilas, lalo na sa yumaong si Sec. Jesse Robredo, [palakpakan] na hanggang ngayon po ay nagsisilbing inspirasyon para sa aming lahat;\r\nKay Senate President Frank Drilon at Speaker Sonny Belmonte: [palakpakan] na talagang nagbigay ng makabuluhang payo sa harap ng mga pinakakomplikadong hamon; kay Cong. Boyet Gonzales at Mel Sarmiento, [palakpakan] at sa iba pang naging katuwang natin sa pagtahak ng Daang Matuwid;\r\nSa lahat ng pinuno at kasapi ng unipormadong hanay, na buong tapang at kagitingang ipinagtatanggol ang ating mga Boss at nakikiambag sa seguridad, hindi lang sa Pilipinas, kundi maging sa ibang panig ng daigdig; [palakpakan] sa lahat ng nagtatrabaho sa iba\u2019t ibang sangay ng gobyerno at tunay na naglilingkod sa kapwa Pilipino;\r\nSa mga negosyante, business federation, at iba pang kabalikat natin sa sektor ng industriya, na nakikiisa sa pagpapaganda ng ating ekonomiya;\r\nSa mga miyembro ng media na naging patas sa kanilang pagsipat; [palakpakan]\r\nSa lahat ng sinamahan tayo sa pagtahak ng Daang Matuwid; partikular ko na pong babanggitin si Deedee Sytangco na nagpahayag ng pagsuporta, lalo na sa panahong mabigat ang problema, [palakpakan] sina Alice Murphy at Yoly Ong, na naging bukal ng makabuluhang payo at inspirasyon nitong mga nakaraang taon; [palakpakan]\r\nSa grupo po nina Jun Reyes at Gigi Vistan na kasama na natin mula pa noong tumakbo ako para sa Kamara hanggang sa Senado. Jun at Gigi, buong pasensiya ninyo akong ginabayan sa tamang bihis, tindig, at pagsalita: Alam ninyong hindi ako tulad ni Kris na sanay sa kamera, at kahit biniro ko kayo na mukhang imposible ang trabaho, naging propesyonal at maaasahan kayo;\r\nSa aking mga tagapayong espirituwal na sina Father Catalino Arevalo, Sister Agnes, at Father Jett Villarin, [palakpakan] pati na kina Cardinal Chito Tagle, Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, Ka Eduardo Manalo, Bishop Soc Villegas, Bishop Jonel Milan, Brother Eddie Villanueva, at sa ating religious sector, \u00a0at sa lahat ng nagpapatuloy, nagdarasal para sa atin, maraming salamat po;\r\nSa mga tulad ni Joe America, isang blogger na di ko man kakilala ay isinulat: \u201cIf the President were in my foxhole, I\u2019d watch his back. That\u2019s because I trust that he is watching mine.\u201d [Palakpakan] Salamat sa iyo at sa iba pang dayuhang nagpamalas ng pakikiisa sa ating agenda ng pagbabago;\r\nSa mga kabataang tulad ni Francesca Santiago, na sa murang edad pa lamang ay nagpapakita ng pagmamahal sa bayan;\r\nKay Noel Cabangon at iba pang kasapi ng sektor ng sining at kultura na ipinahiram ang kanilang talento upang ipahayag ang pagbabago; [palakpakan]\r\nSa aking Ate Ballsy, mga kapatid na sina Pinky, Viel, Kris, at sa aking mga bayaw at pamangkin; [palakpakan] panahon pa nina Mom at Dad, karamay ko na kayo. Nalalapit na ang araw kung kailan hindi ko na kayo kakailanganing idamay sa dagdag pang sakripisyo;\r\nSpecial mention din po: Kina General Chito Dizon na dating pinuno ng Presidential Security Group, at sa kasalukuyang timon nito na si Commodore Raul Ubando, na dadalawang linggo pa lang sa puwesto ay nag-baptism of fire na sa krisis sa Zamboanga; [palakpakan] si Lt. Col. Francis Coronel na head ng aking close-in security, at sina SPO4 Lito Africano at PO3 Bong Fuyonan, na napakatagal na\u00a0pong kasama at pinangangalagaa\r\nn ang seguridad natin; [palakpakan] sa buong PSG, na ipinakita ang propesyonalismo sa pagprotekta hindi lang sa akin, kundi pati kina Pangulong Obama at Pope Francis: Huwag kayong mag-alala, may 21 world leaders pang darating para sa APEC. Karamay ko kayo sa hirap at ginhawa. Malamang, mamaya, bago kayo matulog, baka magkatanungan kayo kung bakit napakaraming hirap at kung nasaan ang ginhawa; parating na po tayo diyan.\r\nKay Asec. Susan Reyes, ang ating Social Secretary, [palakpakan] na nagpapatunay na di kailangang maging magarbo para itaas ang dignidad ng ating tanggapan; kay Paul Cabral, na laging sinisigurong maayos ang aking kasuotan, [palakpakan] tuloy akala nila mayroon akong fashion sense; at kay Cherry Reyes, na nag-aayos ng aking buhok [tawanan], at nagmimistulang economics practitioner dahil pinupunuan niya ang unlimited wants with very limited resources; [tawanan]\r\nSa mga kasapi ng aking Private Office sa Malaca\u00f1ang, lalong-lalo na kina Usec. Rochelle Ahorro at Asec. Jun Delantar, [palakpakan] na karamay ko sa stress sa maraming pagkakataon;\r\nAt gusto ko pong ipakilala sa inyo, sa mga hindi nakaaalala sa inyo, si Yolly Yebes, na namamahala sa aking tahanan. [Palakpakan] Sinisiguro mong nakakakain ako sa tamang oras, inaayos ang aking gamit tuwing may biyahe sa Pilipinas man o sa ibang bansa, at kung minsan pa nga ay pinagkakatiwalaan pa kitang humawak ng dokumento at nabibilinan para sa aking trabaho. Tunay mong ipinaparamdam ang iyong kalinga hindi lang sa akin, kundi pati sa mga katrabaho ko sa gobyerno. Kapag sinabi ko sa iyong, \u201cmay meeting tayo, pakihanda mo naman ang makakain,\u201d hindi mo na ako tinatanong ng \u201ckailan\u201d o \u201cilan\u201d; hindi mo na ako pinag-aalala, tinitiyak mo na lamang na lahat ng kailangan ay maasikaso. Yolly, minabuti kong personal mong mapanood ang SONAng ito, para masabi ko sa iyo: Maraming salamat sa pakikiambag mo. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa mga hindi nagdalawang-isip na tumulong sa repacking ng relief goods sa panahon ng sakuna; sa bawat Pilipinong naghandog ng anumang halaga at nagpaikot ng alkansiya para magdala ng pagbabago; sa lahat ng nagparamdam ng suporta, sa text man, liham, o personal; sa bawat batang yumakap sa aking binti at tiningala ako para ngitian; sa bawat estudyanteng nakipag-selfie; sa lahat ng nakisiksik para makipagkamay:\r\nMga Boss, baka nga po bahagi ng planong wala pa akong katuwang sa buhay o anak, kaya ang naging tutok ko lang ay ang taumbayan. Sa trabahong ito, para akong punching bag na tinapalan ng katakot-takot na duct tape. Pero hindi ako natinag dahil nasa likod ko kayo. Tunay ngang hindi ako nag-iisa. [Palakpakan] Ang kongklusyon ko nga po sa lahat ng ito: Talagang ginagabayan pa rin ako ng aking mga magulang; totoong mahal tayo ng Diyos. Sa inyong lahat: Maraming-maraming salamat. Napakalaking karangalan ang pamunuan po kayong lahat. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng pasasalamat pong ito, may kasamang panawagan. Ang mga naipunla sa Daang Matuwid, nagdadala na ngayon ng ani, at magdadala ng mas mayabong pang ani sa mga susunod na panahon. Pero mangyayari lang ito kung didiligan at babantayan pa natin ang pananim.\r\nIlang halimbawa po: Hindi puwedeng putulin na lang ang pagtutok sa modernisasyon ng AFP. Sa Pantawid Pamilya, kapag naitawid na ang bottom 20 percent tungo sa susunod na antas, kailangang siguruhing hindi sila basta-basta babalik sa kahirapan kung tamaan ng sakit o sakuna.\r\nSa disaster management: Dahil sa malasakit sa isa\u2019t isa, at sa aktibong ugnayan sa mga local government units, naibangon agad natin ang Bohol at Cebu matapos ang\r\n. Sa\r\nat Tacloban naman, agad nating tinugunan ang pangunahing pangangailangan. Mula sa agarang paghahatid ng pagkain at pagsigurong walang outbreak ng sakit; sa mabilisang pagbabalik ng kuryente, at pagbubukas ng mga kalsada; hanggang sa pabahay at programang pangkabuhayan, ibinuhos at ibinubuhos ng pambansang gobyerno ang lahat ng makakaya. [Palakpakan] Pero may mga natitira pa pong gawain: May mga komunidad pa rin tayong namumuhay sa peligrosong lugar na kakailanganing ilayo sa panganib. Para naman sa rebuilding, kailangang paigtingin ang ugnayan ng lokal at pambansang antas, para mapabilis ang mga tinatapos natin.\r\nSa ugnayang panlabas: Ginawa at ginagawa rin po natin ang lahat para maging responsableng miyembro ng pandaigdigang komunidad; sa bawat hakbang, ang hinihiling lang natin ay ang makatwiran at naaayon sa batas. Ang problema ng lahat, isinulong nating solusyonan ng lahat, at hindi ng iilang panig lamang. Alam din po ninyo, may hinaharap tayong hamon sa West Philippine Sea. Ang ating kabangga, di-hamak na mas lamang, sa impluwensiya man, ekonomiya, o puwersang militar. Pero sa batayan ng katwiran at pagmamahal sa bayan, hindi po tayo nahuhuli. Kaya gaya sa lahat ng iba pang suliranin, pagkakaisa po ang tanging susi para mapangalagaan ang ating karapatan.\r\nMga Boss, sa totoo lang, sa mga hinarap nating hamon, puwede namang nagbigay na lang tayo ng band-aid solution. Puwedeng nag-abot na lang tayo ng isang supot ng relief goods, o nakipagsiksikan sa mga photo-op. Pero alam naman nating sa Pilipinas, galit ang tao sa epal. Aanhin nga naman ang pogi points kung magpapamana lang din naman ako ng problema sa susunod na salinlahi? Sa bawat pagkakataon, hinahanap natin ang tunay na sanhi ng mga problema, at naglalatag ng malinaw at pangmatagalang estratehiya upang malutas ito. Ang mga hamon ng bansa, kung hindi man nalutas na, ay nasimulan na ang mga hakbang upang marating ang permanenteng solusyon.\r\nIyan nga ang napakalaking pagkakaiba. Dati, walang pag-asa. Ngayon, inaasahan, inaabangan, at madalas nga po ay minamadali pa natin ang gobyernong solusyonan ang mga problemang ating hinaharap.\r\nMagbalik-tanaw po tayo: Sa dami ng mga maling kinailangan nating iwasto, hindi lang tayo nanggaling sa zero, sa negative pa tayo nagmula. Negative sa kasangkapang gumawa ng pagbabago. Negative sa pagkakataon. Negative sa pag-asa. Binuno natin ang lahat ng kakulangan; nagdala tayo ng positibong pagbabago, at lampas-lampas pa talaga sa ating inaasahan ang ating narating.\r\nPakinggan po natin ang ilan pang testimonya nito:\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nMga Boss, kung hindi mapapatid ang transpormasyon, makatwiran nga pong sabihin: Tikim pa lamang itong nakamtan natin; parating pa lang ang tunay na ihahain. Ang sabi nga po natin: You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. [Palakpakan]\r\nNabanggit ko po kanina ang SWS survey na hindi masyadong naibalita: 8 out of 10 na mga Pilipino, naniniwalang developed o magiging developed country tayo sa hinaharap. Ito po, pananaw ng ating mga kababayan. Pero ang mga ekonomista po mismo ng NEDA, pinag-aralan ito sa siyentipikong paraan, at pareho ang kanilang kongklusyon.\r\nTingnan natin: Mula 2010 hanggang 2014, nagtala tayo ng average GDP growth na 6.2 percent; ito ang pinakamasiglang yugto ng ating ekonomiya sa loob ng 40 taon. [Palakpakan] Kung aabot po tayo sa 6.8 percent ngayong 2015, makakamtan natin ang pinakamataas na six-year average growth sa loob ng halos anim na dekada. [Palakpakan] Siyempre po, ang pag-angat ng ekonomiya, may katumbas na pag-angat ng kakayahan ng gobyernong kumalinga at magbigay-lakas sa mamamayan upang masagad ang mga bumubukas na pagkakataon.\r\nNakikita po ninyo, kung hindi tayo maaantala, kung magtutuloy ang Daang Matuwid, sa loob ng isang henerasyon, first world na raw po tayo. Kung magpapatuloy ang mga repormang bukal ng paglago ng ekonomiya, paglaon, ang tinitingala nating mga bansa, makakapantay na natin, kundi man malalampasan. [Palakpakan] Ito po ba, inambisyon ng kahit sino sa atin noong tayo\u2019y nagsisimula?\r\nSa kabilang banda naman, kung tayo\u2019y babalik sa baluktot, habambuhay tayong mag-aabang sa wala. Muli tayong mapapag-iwanan, at mababali ang pataas na trajectory ng ating ekonomiya.\r\nNapakaganda na talaga ng ating naipunla, at nagbuhos na tayo ng matinding pagod at sakripisyo upang diligan ito. Sino ba namang nasa tamang isip ang bigla na lamang puputulin ang puno, kung kailan nagsisimula pa lang nating pitasin ang mga unang bunga nito?\r\nMay sentimyentong umiiral na sa tingin ko, mahuhuli ng isang tanong. Ang tanong po nila, \u201cLahat ba ng ating naipundar, lahat ba ng ating pinaghirapan, maglalaho dahil lang sa isang eleksiyon?\u201d [Palakpakan at tawanan] Sa ganitong pananaw, ang susunod na halalan ay referendum po para sa Daang Matuwid. Kayo ang magdedesisyon kung ang pagbabago bang ating tinatamasa ay magiging permanente, o tatanawin lang bilang tsamba at panandaliang pagbangon sa isang mahabang kasaysayan ng pagkadapa.\r\nAng tanong: Tama ba itong landas na tinatahak natin? Kung sasabihin ninyong hindi, para na rin ninyong sinabing \u201cMas gusto ko sa dati; bumalik na lang tayo sa baluktot.\u201d \u2018Pag iyan po ang inyong itinugon, ako\u2019y mananahimik na lang.\r\nPero kung ang tugon naman ninyo ay \u201cOo,\u201d tulad ng lagi, ako naman po\u2019y handang maging inyong dakilang alalay. Maski sa pagbaba sa puwesto, hanggang sa aking huling hininga, makakaasa kayo, gaya ng walang patid ninyong pananatili bilang aking lakas, hindi rin kayo mag-iisa; sasamahan ko kayo, tatabihan ko kayo, magkakapit-bisig nating isasabuhay ang Daang Matuwid. [Palakpakan]\r\nMga Boss, aaminin ko: Ni minsan po, hindi ko sinabing ako\u2019y perpekto. Minsan, binigo tayo ng ilang inasahan nating alam dapat ang kanilang trabaho. Sa mga panahong tila gumana ang pagpapaduda, baka hindi rin namin nahanap agad at naibahagi ang impormasyon sa oras at sa paraang nais ninyo. Hinihingi ko po muli ang inyong pag-unawa sa mga bagay na ito.\r\nSa kabila nito, mahaharap ko ang sinoman at masasabing: Ginawa ko ang pinakamainam na desisyon batay sa kaalaman at kakayahang mayroon tayo sa panahong iyon. Kaisa-isang interes ko ang kapakanan ng aking Boss. Ginawa ko ang lahat upang iwanang mas makatarungan, mas maunlad, at tumatamasa ng makabuluhang pagbabago ang ating bansa. [Palakpakan] Hahayaan ko na pong kasaysayan ang humusga. Gaya nga po noong burol ng aking ina, bibigkasin ko ang Ikalawang Aklat ni Timoteo, Kabanata 4, Bersikulo 7: \u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nMga Boss, nanggaling tayo sa sitwasyon kung saan tila nababalot ng kadiliman ang ating bansa; ni hindi natin masigurong may liwanag pang paparating. Binabati na tayo ng bukang-liwayway ng katarungan at pagkakataon.\r\nNakita naman ninyo ang mga naabot natin. Narinig ninyo ang kuwento ng kapwa natin Pilipinong pinatunayan ang kayang maabot gamit ang sariling lakas, ang pagbabayanihan, ang hindi pag-uunahan, ang pag-aambagan tungo sa katuparan ng kolektibo nating mga adhikain. Ngayon, taas-noo na tayong humaharap sa buong mundo at nasasabing, \u201cKaya ko. Kaya ng Pilipino. Simula pa lang ito.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nOpo, simula pa lang ito. Simula pa lang ng isang bansang hindi mapapayuko, bagkus ay nagiging huwaran ng paninindigan sa buong mundo. Simula pa lang ng ginhawang bunga ng kalayaan mula sa katiwalian. Simula pa lang ng lipunan kung saan ang bawat Pilipino, kung magbabanat ng buto, kung gagawin ang tama, ay tiyak na aasenso. Simula pa lang ito, at hinahamon tayo ng kasaysayang diligan ang transpormasyon, upang magbunga ito ng mas marami pang pagkakataon para sa mga susunod na salinlahi.\r\nSimula pa lang ito. [Palakpakan] Nasa unang yugto pa lang tayo ng dakilang kuwento ng sambayanang Pilipino. Sa gabay ng Panginoong Maykapal, at sa patuloy nating pagtahak sa Daang Matuwid, lalo pang tatayog ang mga pangarap na maaabot natin. Lalo pang lalawak ang kaunlarang tinatamasa natin. Nasasainyo pong mga kamay ang direksiyon natin.\r\nMagandang gabi po sa inyong lahat, maraming salamat sa inyong lahat po.\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\n_________________________\r\n[\r\n]", "title": "Sixth State of the Nation Address"},

Thank you very much Speaker De Venecia; Senate President Villar; other newly elected leaders of both Houses, congratulations to you; Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen. Vice President De Castro; former President Ramos; Chief Justice Puno; our host Mayor, Mayor Sonny Belmonte; other government officials; members of the diplomatic corps; ladies and gentlemen.\r\nWe meet here today to inaugurate a new Congress after a fresh election. I congratulate every elected official, from municipal to provincial to Congress on hard fought and successful campaigns. [\r\n]\r\nTapos na ang halalan at pamumulitika; panahon na para maglingkod nang walang damot, [\r\n]\u00a0mamuno nang walang pangamba maliban sa kagalingan ng bayan, and to govern with wisdom, compassion, vision, and patriotism.\r\nHangarin kong mapabilang ang Pilipinas sa mayayamang bansa sa loob ng dalawampung taon. By then, poverty shall have been marginalized; and the marginalized raised to a robust middle class.\r\nWe will have achieved the hallmarks of a modern society, where institutions are strong.\r\nBy 2010, the Philippines should be well on its way to achieving that vision.\r\nWith the tax reforms of the last Congress, and I thank the last Congress, we have turned around our macroeconomic condition through fiscal discipline, toward a balanced budget. Binabayaran ang utang, pababa ang interes, at paakyat ang pondo para sa progreso ng sambayanang Pilipino!!! Maraming salamat ulit sa nakaraang Congress. [\r\n]\r\nWe have been investing hundreds of billions in human and physical infrastructure. The next three years will see record levels of well thought out and generous funding for the following priorities:\r\nFirst, investments in physical, intellectual, legal, and security infrastructure to increase business confidence. Imprastraktura para sa negosyo at trabaho. Isang milyong trabaho taun-taon.\r\nSecond, investments in a stronger and wider social safety net\u2014murang gamot, abot-kayang pabahay, eskwelang primera klase, mga gurong magaling at mas malaki ang kita, mga librong de-kalidad, more scholarships for gifted students, and language instruction to maintain our lead in English proficiency. Dunong at kalusugan ang susi sa kasaganaan.\r\nThird, investments in bringing peace to Mindanao; in crushing terrorism wherever it threatens regardless of ideology; and in putting a stop to human rights abuses whatever the excuse.\r\nWe pay tribute to the fearless 14 who were savagely massacred at Tipo-Tipo trying to pursue a peaceful and progressive Philippines. We will not disappoint their hopes. We will not waste their sacrifice. We will not be swayed from the course we have set in this conflict for peace with justice throughout our land. [\r\n]\r\nWe have created a Philippine model for reconciliation built on interfaith dialogue, expanded public works, and more responsive social services. These investments show both sides in the Mindanao conflict that they have more at stake in common; and a greater reason to be together than hang apart, including being together isolating the terrorists.\r\nImprastraktura ang haliging nagtitindig hindi lamang ng kapayapaan kundi ng ating buong makabagong ekonomiya: mga kalsada, tulay, paliparan, public parks, and power plants.\r\nLast year I unveiled the Super Regions\u2014Mindanao, Central Philippines, North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle, Luzon Urban Beltway, and the Cyber Corridor\u2014to spread development away from an inequitable concentration in Metro Manila. Hindi lamang Maynila ang Pilipinas. [\r\n]\r\nThe Super Regions was not a gimmick for the occasion but a blueprint for building a future.\r\nIn Mindanao, our food basket, I said we would prioritize agribusiness investments. We have, \u00a0and I am happy to see that the latest survey in June that the hunger rate has sharply gone down nationwide. [\r\n]\r\nThe Departments of Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, and Environment and Natural Resources will devote 30 percent of their program budgets to Mindanao. [\r\n] This was the recommendation articulated by Congressman Rufus Rodriguez during our peace and security summit in Cagayan de Oro. [\r\n] The Department of Agrarian Reform will move to Davao.\r\nDapat maging daan sa tagumpay sa agribusiness ang reporma sa lupa. Done right, reform will democratize success, as Ramon Magsaysay and Diosdado Macapagal envisioned. We must reform agrarian reform so it can transform beneficiaries into agribusinessmen and other agribusinesswomen. [\r\n]\r\nSa gayon, dadami pa ang mga tampok na magsasaka gaya ng mga nagwagi ng Gawad Saka, sina Ananias Cuado ng Comval at Demetrio Tabelon ng Butuan; at Nelson Taladhay ng Sultan Kudarat, pangunahing agrarian reform beneficiary ng 2007. We also have outstanding farmers from the other super regions, like Joseph Fernando and Heherson Pagulayan, Nestor Bautista, Joseph Lomibao, Arturo Marcaida, Peter Uy, Arturo Pasacas, and Glenn Saludar. [\r\n] Congratulations to all of you!\r\nSa anim na taon nagtayo tayo at nag-ayos ng patubig para sa 1 milyong ektarya sa buong bansa\u2014pinakamalaki sa matagal na panahon.\r\nMagtatayo tayo ng mariculture o palaisdaan sa dagat. Isa rito ay ilalagay natin sa Sibutu, sa Tawi-Tawi. Hiling ito ni Nur Jaafar. [\r\n]\r\nPara sa buong bansa naglaan tayo ng P3 billion para sa 3,000 kilometro ng farm-to-market roads; 1,000 kilometro sa Mindanao. Gawa na ang 300.\r\nThe road and RORO network has cut the cost of bringing agribusiness products from Mindanao to Luzon. A 10-wheeler used to pay P32,000 from Dapitan to Batangas. Now it pays P11,000. Fresh fish that cost P20,000 a ton to move, now travels at P14,000. [\r\n]\r\nConstruction is crisscrossing Mindanao: Dapitan-Dakak to bring Cely Carreon\u2019s paradise closer to civilization; Sibuco-Siraway-Siocon-Baliguian; Dinagat Island Network, a baptismal gift for Glenda Ecleo\u2019s new province; [\r\n] the 66-kilometer Manay-Mati section of Davao-Surigao; and Maguindanao-Lebak, Sim Datumanong\u2019s brainchild when he headed DPWH. [\r\n]\r\nWe want better airports, new bridges, and ample energy for Mindanao\u2019s rising economy.\r\nThe Dipolog and Pagadian airports will be improved by year\u2019s end. Also the Cotabato airport. No doubt eagerly awaited by Au Cerilles, Rolando Yebes, Digs Dilangalen, Ros Labadlabad, and Victor Yu, and Mayors Evelyn Uy and Sammy Co. [\r\n]\r\nLast July 10 we inaugurated the P1.7 billion, 900-meter bridge in Butuan, built on the initiative of Mayor Boy Daku Plaza, [\r\n] near the P4 billion second-generation flood control project that we also built. The first was built by my father after the great flood of Butuan in the 1960s. Kailangan ipagtanggol ang kapaligiran at mamamayan sa sakuna. [\r\n]\r\nIn Agusan del Norte, I hope Edel Amante will be happy with our plans to pilot micro agribusiness in Jabonga. [\r\n]\r\nOn July 8, Ozamis Airport opened, bankrolled partly by Leo Ocampos, Aldo Parojinog, and Hermie Ramiro\u2019s congressional fund. [\r\n] Now, that\u2019s the kind of pork that has good cholesterol. [\r\n]\r\nAt that occasion the MOU was signed for the Pangil Bay Bridge that will connect Ozamis to Lanao del Norte and Iligan. [\r\n] As urged by Bobby Dimaporo, I declared Mt. Inayawan Range a protected nature park. On Mayor Lawrence Cruz\u2019s recommendation, I instruct DPWH to build the Iligan Circumferential Road. [\r\n]\r\nIn 2001, we opened a solar plant in Cagayan de Oro. Still, Mindanao faced a 100-megawatt gap by 2009 but now a 210-megawatt clean coal plant in Phividec will fill that gap. We count on Oca Moreno and ex-congressman-now-city-mayor Tinex Jaraula to continue providing a good investment climate. [\r\n]\r\nWe thank Miriam Defensor-Santiago and Migz Zubiri for sponsoring the Biofuels Law in the last Congress. [\r\n] We now have 160,000 hectares of jatropha nurseries in Bukidnon and 30,000 in General Santos. Jatropha is a 100 percent substitute for diesel, with only 5 percent of its emission.\r\nBut Mindanao\u2019s energy challenge lies not in generating power but in power lines. Terrorists target transmission towers. We must resolutely apply the Human Security Act. This act was first filed by Johnny Enrile in 1996, three years after the first World Trade Center bombing, four years before the Rizal Day bombing, and five years before 9/11. He ably crafted the final Senate version with Senate President Manny Villar and Nene Pimentel. [\r\n]\r\nLet\u2019s now go to Central Philippines, our tourism super region:\r\nAnd, so is the North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle:\r\nAnd now the Luzon Urban Beltway, our top magnet for industry and investment:\r\nThe Cyber Corridor encompasses centers of technology and learning running the length of all the super regions, from Baguio to Clark to Metro Manila to Cebu to Davao and neighboring areas. [\r\n]\r\nThe Philippines ranks among top off-shoring hubs in the world because of cost competitiveness and more importantly our highly trainable, English proficient, IT-enabled management and manpower.\r\nIT ability won for Warren Ambat of Baguio City High the most innovative teacher and leadership award in Cambodia last February, topping contestants from 70 countries. Congratulations Baguio and Warren! [\r\n]\r\nInformation technology will help the BIR bring in more taxes in the coming months. Its Revenue Watch Dashboard will monitor revenue collections in real time from the national level down to the examiners. Its LGU Revenue Assurance will share information between the BIR and the LGUs to uncover fraud and nonpayment, before heads would roll per Danny Suarez\u2019s Attrition Law. [\r\n]\r\nWhile our strength in contact centers is well established, we are now focused on growing the higher value-added services, including accounting, legal, human resources, and administrative services.\r\nAnd, so that no Taiwan tremor can cut off our cyber services from their global clients, thanks to PLDT and Globe for investing P47 billion in new international broadband links through other regional hubs for redundancy in our cyberspace. [\r\n]\r\nThe business services sector has become the fastest growing in the economy providing 400,000 jobs compared to 8,000 in 2000. By 2010 the forecast is 1 million jobs earning $12 billion, the same amount remitted by our overseas Filipinos today. [\r\n]\r\nLast year I said that in today\u2019s global economy, knowledge is the greatest creator of wealth. Mahusay na edukasyon ang pinakamabuting pamana natin sa ating mga anak. Yun din ang tanging pamana na ayon sa batas kailangang ibigay sa bawat mamamayan.\r\nThis year, we are investing more for education: P150 billion, P29 billion more than last year.\r\nAnd, last year government and private sector built 15,000 classrooms instead of the usual 6,000.\r\nNoon, isang libro bawat limang mag-aaral. Ngayon, tig-isang aklat na bawat grade schooler. [\r\n]\r\nOne third of our public high schools now have Internet access, with private sector support.\r\nWe have a scarcity of public high schools but a surplus of private high schools. So instead of building more high schools, we give more high school scholarships\u2014600,000 scholars this year. [\r\n]\r\nFor college, we launched a P4 billion fund for college loans, to increase beneficiaries from 40,000 to 200,000.\r\nAnd for teachers, we have created more than 50,000 teaching positions. But we have to improve their training.\r\nBenefits, too. Salamat, dating Senador Tessie Oreta at dating Congressman Dodong Gullas, na di na kailangan ng mga guro maghabol sa Maynila ng sweldo at pension. [\r\n] Pinoproseso na sa rehiyon sa regionalization ng payroll.\r\nTeachers and all other national government employees for that matter get a raise effective end of this month. [\r\n]\r\nSa TESDA, bukod sa mga sariling kurso, nagbibigay ito ng mga scholarship sa vocational schools: P600 million noong isang taon, P1 billion ngayon. May P1 billion pa ang DOLE.\r\nWe are investing P3 billion in science and engineering research and development technology, including scholarships for masters and doctoral degrees in engineering in seven universities. Upgrade know-how and learning, and Filipino talent is unbeatable.\r\nProof is biochemist Baldomero Olivera of the University of Utah who was named Scientist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation. [\r\n]\r\nIn the International Math and Science Olympiad 2006 in Jakarta, Robert Buendia of Cavite Central School and Wilson Alba of San Beda Alabang won the gold. Congratulations, guys! [\r\n] Six Filipinos bagged the awards at the Intel Young Scientists Competition in New Mexico last May: Ivy Ventura, Mara Villaverde, Hester Mana Umayam, and Janine Santiago of Philippine Science High; [\r\n] Melvin Barroa of Capiz National High, congratulations, Melvin; [\r\n]\u00a0and Luigi John Suarez of Benedicto National High. Congratulations naman. [\r\n]\u00a0Last week Filipino students topbilled by Amiel Sy of the Philippine Science High dominated the Mathematics World Contest in Hong Kong. Congratulations, Amiel. Congratulations Philippine Science High.\u00a0[\r\n] Earlier this month Diona Aquino of the Presidential Management Staff won with her team from UP the Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance in Shanghai.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIto ay malaking kunsuwelo sa atin. We have spent more on human capital formation than ever in the past. Why? Because if government of the people and by the people is not for them as well, it is a mockery of democracy.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMay malaking pag-angat ang kalagayan ng maralita, gaya ng trabaho, pag-aaral, at paggamot. Look at the chart about how fare the poor.\r\nSa unang pagkakataon, gumastos ang Philhealth ng higit P3 bilyon sa paospital ng maralita.\r\nNoong 2001 sinabi kong hahatiin natin ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng madla. Ngayon 10,000 Botika ng Barangay ang nagtitinda ng murang gamot. Ang paracetamol na tatlong piso sa labas ay piso lamang sa Botika ng Barangay. Ang antibiotic na binibenta ng mga pangunahing parmasya sa P20 ay P2 lamang.\r\nKaya sa isang survey, halos kalahati ang nagsabing abot-kaya ang gamot, kumpara sa 11 percent noong 1999.\r\nSo we can spread this even more, I ask Congress to pass the Cheaper Medicines Bill [\r\n] that was almost enacted in June. Almost is not good enough. Let\u2019s help Mar Roxas and Ferge Biron and Teddy Boy Locsin give our people meaningful, affordable choices, from abroad and here in the Philippines. [\r\n]\r\nI also ask Congress to pass legislation that brings improved long-term care for our senior citizens. Asahan natin si Ed Angara. [\r\n]\r\nSi Noli de Castro na isa pang kampeon ng senior citizens ay namumuno ng ating programa sa pabahay. Congratulations, Noli. The low interest rates for housing are unprecedented. [\r\n] Naglaan ang Pag-IBIG ng P25 billion na pautang, six times the amount when we started it in 2001. At P50 billion pa ang ilalaan hanggang 2010. [\r\n]\r\nWe fight terrorism. It threatens our sovereign, democratic, compassionate, and decent way of life.\r\nTherefore, in the fight against lawless violence, we must uphold these values. It is never right and always wrong to fight terror with terror.\r\nAnd so I ask Congress \u2026 I urge you to enact laws to transform state response to political violence: First, laws to protect witnesses from lawbreakers and law enforcers. [\r\n] Second, laws to guarantee swift justice from more empowered special courts. [\r\n] Third, laws to impose harsher penalties for political killings. [\r\n] Fourth, laws reserving the harshest penalties for the rogue elements in the uniformed services who betray public trust and bring shame to the greater number of their colleagues who are patriotic. [\r\n]\r\nWe must wipe this stain from our democratic record.\r\nNgunit pangunahing pakikibaka pa rin para sa karapatan ang pagpapalaya ng masa sa gutom at kahirapan.\r\nTogether with economic prosperity is the need to strengthen our institutions of government. Let\u2019s start with election reform. We have long provided funds for computerization. We look forward to the modernization of voting, counting, and canvassing. [\r\n]\r\nWe can disagree on political goals but never on the conduct of democratic elections. I ask Congress to fund poll watchdogs, and to enact a stronger law against election-related violence. [\r\n]\r\nWe must weed out corruption and build a strong system of justice that the people can trust. We have provided unprecedented billions for antigraft efforts. Thus the Ombudsman\u2019s conviction rate hit 77 percent this year, from 6 percent in 2002. [\r\n] We implemented lifestyle checks, dormant for half a century. Taun-taon dose-dosenang opisyal ang nasususpinde, napapatalsik, o kinakasuhan dahil labis-labis sa suweldo ang gastos at ari-arian nila.\r\nFirms who were asked for bribes in taxes, permits, and licenses dropped to one-third from one-half. Contract bribes are also down. Graft won\u2019t be eliminated overnight but we are making progress. [\r\n]\r\nWhat I have outlined today is just a sampler of our P1.7 trillion Medium Term Public Investment Program. How will we fund all these? P1 trillion from state revenues, with tax reforms and firm orders to BIR and Customs to hit their targets. P300 billion from state corporations. The balance from government financial institutions, private sector investments, local government equity, and our bilateral and multilateral partners.\r\nOur new confidence and momentum for progress have imbued our foreign relations, with the ASEAN Summit last year and the coming ASEAN Regional Forum, with increased assistance from our allies and with continued support for our peace and security efforts in Mindanao.\r\nWe were able to strengthen our economy because of the fiscal reforms that we adopted at such great cost to me in public disapproval. But I would rather be right than popular. [\r\n]\r\nOur fundamentals are paying off in huge leaps in investment. Anim na milyong trabaho ang nalikha sa anim na taon, most in sustainable enterprises. Sa lakas ng piso, bumagal ang pagtaas ng bilihin. [\r\n]\r\nIt is my ardent wish that most of the vision I have outlined will be fully achieved when I step down. It is my unshakable resolve that the fundamentals of this vision will by then be permanently rooted, its progress well advanced, and its direction firmly fixed with our reforms already bearing fruit. All that will remain for my successor is to gather the harvest. He or she will have an easier time of it than I did. [\r\n]\r\nThey say the campaign for the next election started on May 15, the day after the last. Fine.\r\nI stand in the way of no one\u2019s ambition. I only ask that no one stand in the way of the people\u2019s well-being and the nation\u2019s progress. [\r\n]\r\nThe time for facing off is over. The time is here for facing forward to a better future our people so desperately want and richly deserve.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nUulitin ko: Hindi ako sagabal sa ambisyon ninuman.\r\nBut make no mistake. I will not stand idly when anyone gets in the way of the national interest and tries to block the national vision. [\r\n]\u00a0From where I sit, I can tell you, a President is always as strong as she wants to be.\u00a0[\r\n] [\r\n]\r\nPagpalain tayo ng Diyos at ang dakilang gawaing hinaharap natin. The state of the nation is strong.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nInyong lingkod, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, pangulo ng Republika ng Pilipinas.\u00a0[\r\n]\u00a0[\r\n]", "title": "Seventh State of the Nation Address"},

The other is the Philippines whose political system, after equally long years of degeneration, has become a hindrance to progress.\r\nAs a country on the verge of take off, our storyline would surprise many at home and abroad. The story includes an economy that grew more than 6% last year and that has continued to work in the teeth of the biggest oil price hikes in history, while generating 4 million jobs in the last four years. [\r\n]\r\nThe story includes marked improvements in tax collections, infrastructure, housing construction, shelter security for the urban poor and indigenous peoples, and rice productivity. [\r\n]\r\nThe story includes 69 million beneficiaries of health care insurance, including 30 million indigents, whose re-enrollment started early this year and is still ongoing. [\r\n]\r\nThat same story, over four years, saw the drug menace cut in half, the rash of kidnappings become a thing of the past, and insurgency in the south abated.\r\nThis story should work itself out as one about an economy as resilient and full of potential as its people are patient and hardworking, guided by a government\u2013with the executive and the legislative hand-in-hand\u2014that is able to pass a no-nonsense budget and make the tough decisions to put our fiscal house in order. [\r\n]\r\nI especially refer to our recent titanic struggle to enact the three laws that comprised the biggest fiscal package in our history, the biggest revenue increase in a generation that will break the vicious cycle of financing development by borrowing and having to borrow again just to service those loans. This is the one reform that will snap the chain that has bound our future to a profligate past and the debt-burdened present. [\r\n] The Filipino\u2019s strong sense of family has given Congress a stronger resolve not to pass on today\u2019s debt, and bankrupt our children and grandchildren tomorrow. That struggle has done the House and the Senate great honor. Congratulations to you. [\r\n]\r\nAbroad, the story continues. We\u2019ve worked long and hard to restore our country to the prominent place it once held as cofounder of the United Nations and the free world\u2019s first line of defense in the east. We won a seat in the UN security council, where we presided over the landmark resolution calling for democracy in Iraq. The Philippines chaired the historic conference on interfaith cooperation for peace at the UN, the fruit of a bold and creative initiative by your Speaker of the House. [\r\n]\r\nWe head the APEC antiterrorism task force. Our victories in the war on terror have been acknowledged by no less than President Bush before the U.S. National Defense University. The Jemaah Islamiya and the Abu Sayyaf can only pick up the pieces of its broken backbone in Mindanao.\r\nWe\u2019ve worked with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to forge peace with our Muslim brothers. Eighty percent of our peace talks with them have been completed. [\r\n] Permanent peace in Mindanao is within reach.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIndeed, our story as a country on the verge of take off is real. Analysts need only to look at our stock market, and even the peso-dollar exchange rate, to sense the strong anticipation of significant improvements, if only we would overcome the tendency to be our own worst enemy.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThus, with investors both here and abroad in mind, I invite you all to join me in sending them a strong message from this great hall: We will not waver in our commitment to economic reform and fiscal discipline, whatever the political cost.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe other message to send is that we will address the burden that the other Philippine story imposes on our anticipated take off. I refer to the story of how our political system has now become a hindrance to our national progress.\r\nOver the years, our political system has degenerated to the extent that it is difficult for anyone to make any headway yet keep his hands clean. To be sure, the system is still capable of achieving great reforms. But, by and large, our political system has betrayed its promise to each new generation of Filipinos, not a few of whom are voting with their feet, going abroad, and leaving that system behind.\r\nPerhaps we politicians have done our best; but maybe our best is not enough, given the present system. Perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit.\r\nIt is time to turn to the people, bring them into government, and change the way that government is done.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe people want government that works for them at every level. They want good government that begins at their doorstep in the barangay, and does not end before the closed door of a bureaucrat in Metro Manila.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe system clearly needs fundamental change, and the sooner the better. [\r\n]\u00a0It\u2019s time to start the great debate on charter change.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe must address such questions as how much more government is needed for the greater safety and economic security of our people, and how much less government is more conducive to free enterprise and economic progress.\r\nThe mode of charter change is the exclusive prerogative of Congress. But a constituent assembly may well give our people the quickest reforms.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI shall work with Congress, civil society groups, and local government executives [\r\n]\u00a0who are convinced that charter changes are needed to enable the country to surmount the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI take this opportunity to acknowledge the local government executives [\r\n]\u00a0who have brought about an LGU power revolution through transformative leadership.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThe economic progress and social stability of the provinces, along with the increasing self-reliance and efficiency of political developments and public services there, make a compelling case for federalism.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to take the power from the center to the countryside that feeds it.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI recognize that our form of government will be the decision of the body constituted to undertake charter change. But we should consider that legislation could be quickened and laws made more responsive to the people under a parliamentary system, similar to that [\r\n]\u00a0of our progressive neighbors in the region.\r\nBut even as we make a serious start in charter change, I hope we can still work together on other initiatives to the lasting benefit of our people.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn the area of education, we\u2019ve spent our increased resources on better-trained teachers in more classrooms, teaching students in more effective ways. We\u2019ve laid a strong foundation by building almost 30,000 classrooms in the past four years, providing computer access to more than 3,000 high schools, and beginning a \u201chealthy start\u201d breakfast program for our young schoolchildren.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nI ask congress to pass the Pre-Need Code to rehabilitate, reform and regulate the pre-need educational programs that worked so well in the past as a major vehicle for youth education entitlement.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nCollege education is the great Filipino dream. But in a world of rapid technological change, getting a job or keeping it depends as much on how well one reasons as how well one uses his hands. I have issued E.O. 358 so that hours spent in vocational training can be credited towards a college degree. [\r\n]\u00a0That will combine job readiness with the dream of a college education while increasing the competitiveness of our nation.\r\nBut our competitiveness is greatly endangered today by the global oil crisis. I call on Congress to pass legislation encouraging renewable and indigenous energy.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIn the area of national security, I urge the swift passage of an antiterrorism law that will protect rather than subvert, enhance rather than weaken, the rights and liberties that terrorism precisely threatens with extinction.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nThese examples serve to highlight that there is much work to be done.\r\nNow is not the time for divisiveness, and while there\u2019s no avoiding partisan politics, there can be a determined effort by all sides to limit the collateral damage on a country poised for take-off.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nLet\u2019s call on the Lord to lead us. Let us ask him for the grace to make us worthy of his healing our land.\r\nAlam kong tayong lahat ay naghahangad ng isang makabuluhang pagbabago para sa ating bayan. Tayong lahat ay nagsisikap para matamo ang kapayapaan at kaunlaran. Kung kaya\u2019t ako\u2019y nakikiusap na tulungan ninyo ako, para sa kapakanan ng ating bayan.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nWe may disagree among ourselves but let us never lose sight of that greater battle for one people, one country, one Philippines.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNot the country of this or that president but the Philippines of our shared and passionate affections.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.\u00a0[\r\n] [\r\n]\r\nThank you.", "title": "Fifth State of the Nation Address"},

Aquino III", "text": "[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shto-6KCBqw[/youtube]\r\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 22, 2013]\r\nMarami pong salamat. Maupo ho tayong lahat.\r\nBise Presidente Jejomar Binay; Senate President Franklin M. Drilon; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr.; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga kagalang-galang na mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Senado at Kamara de Representante; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga unipormadong kasapi ng militar at kapulisan; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan:\r\nIsang magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat. [\r\n]\r\nIto po ang aking ikaapat na SONA; dalawa na lamang ang natitira. Halos apat na taon na nga po ang lumipas nang una akong nilapitan ng ilang kampo upang hikayating tumakbo sa pagkapangulo. Ang sabi nila: Alam naming hindi masosolusyunan sa isang tulog, sa isang taon, o kahit pa sa anim na taong termino ng isang Presidente ang lahat ng problema ng bansa. Pero simulan mo lang, at tiyak, kasama mo kaming mag-aaruga nito.\r\nNoon pa man, mulat po ako sa tindi ng mga problemang aking kakaharapin. Mula sa pagiging kandidato, o Presidente na, o kahit ba matapos nang makababa sa puwesto, hindi biro ang peligrong kakambal ng trabahong ito. Malawakang transpormasyon ng lipunan ang aking hangarin, at mulat akong marami akong kailangang banggain para matupad ito. Pero hindi po ako pinalaki ng aking mga magulang para tumiklop lamang sa mga hamon. Hindi ko mahaharap ang aking sarili kung tinanggihan ko ang pagkakataong bawasan ang pagdurusang hindi naman dapat dinaraanan ng Pilipino. [\r\n]\r\nTumugon nga po tayo sa panawagan, at ang mga kasama natin noong una, nadagdagan pa. Sa paniniwala ko nga po, kung tama ang aking ginagawa, lalo pang dadami ang ating magiging kasangga. Nito ngang nakaraang Mayo, tinanong ko kayo, \u201cBoss, tama ba ang direksyon natin?\u201d Ang tugon ninyo: \u201cTama, at pabilisin pa natin ang transpormasyon ng lipunan.\u201d Humiling ako ng mga kakamping makikisagwan sa iisang direksyon, at ibinigay ninyo ito. Ang totoo nga po, hindi lang mayorya, hindi lang siyam sa labindalawa, kundi siyam sa sampung pinakamataas na puwesto na senador ay mga taong inilapit ko sa inyo. [\r\n] Sa aking pakiwari, malinaw po ang mensahe nitong huling halalan: Tama, ituloy natin, damihan pa natin ang 8,581 na sitiong napailawan; dagdagan pa natin ang 28,398 na pamilyang dati\u2019y informal settler, ngunit ngayon ay mayroon na o magkakaroon na ng disenteng tirahan; palaguin pa natin ang di bababa sa 40 bilyong piso kada taong dagdag ng perang napupunta sa edukasyon, kalusugan, serbisyong panlipunan, at marami pang iba, dahil sa tama at mas masugid na pagkolekta ng buwis; dama namin ang marami pang ibang patunay na talagang nagbabago ang lipunan. Lalo nga po akong nabuhayan sa ipinarating ninyong mensahe; malinaw po talagang hindi ako nag-iisa sa pagpasan ng mga responsibilidad. [\r\n] Paano ba naman pong hindi lalakas ang aking loob, kung pati ang mga tulad ni Ginoong Ni\u00f1o Aguirre ay nakikihubog sa ating kinabukasan? Isipin po ninyo, hindi na nga makalakad dahil sa kapansanan, pilit pa rin niyang inakyat ang presintong nasa ikaapat na palapag ng gusali, para lang makaboto at makiambag sa tunay na pagbabago ng lipunan. Salamat, Ginoong Aguirre. [\r\n]\r\nHindi nga po nauubos ang mga Pilipinong handang makiambag, na siyang ugat ng pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon. Ang stratehiya: Sagarin ang oportunidad para sa lahat, lalo na para sa mga mas nangangailangan. Hindi natin pakay maghintay ng trickle down; hindi puwedeng baka sakali o tsamba lang silang daratnan ng mga biyaya ng kaunlaran. Ito pong tinatawag nating inclusive growth\u2014itong malawakang kaunlaran\u2014ang mismong prinsipyong bukal ng bawat inisyatiba, bawat kilos, bawat desisyon ng inyong gobyerno. Ang maiiwan na lamang ay ang ayaw sumama, dahil hindi sinamantala ang pagkakataon.\r\nAng atin pong batayang prinsipyo: Malawakang pagkakataon ang susi sa malawakan at pangmatagalang kaunlaran. Huwag po sana nating kalimutan na ang pagkakataon ay punla lamang. Kailangan itong diligin ng sipag, alagaan ng determinasyon, at payabungin ng dedikasyon. Tingnan nga lang po natin ang mga TESDA-DOLE [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority-Department of Labor and Employment] scholars. Sa 503,521 na napagtapos na natin dito, tinatayang anim sa bawat sampu ang nagtatrabaho na. [\r\n] Noong araw po, ayon sa pag-aaral ng DBM [Department of Budget and Management] noong 2006 hanggang 2008, ang nakakahanap ng trabaho sa mga napagtapos ng TESDA: 28.5 percent lamang. Noong lumipas na taon naman po: sa IT-BPO [information technology-business process outsourcing] program, 70.9 percent ang employment rate ng ating mga nagtapos sa TESDA. Sa electronics and semiconductor program naman, umabot sa 85 percent na mga nagtapos noong 2012 ang nagkatrabaho. Malinaw po: Kayo mismo ang huhubog, kayo mismo ang magdidikta kung hinog at matamis ang bungang kolektibo nating pipitasin, o kung magiging bulok at katiting ang kahihinatnan ng mga pagkakataong bumubukas sa kabanatang ito ng ating kasaysayan.\r\nIsa-isahin po natin. Ang layuning palawakin ang saklaw ng Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program: natupad. Ang dinatnan nating mahigit 700,000 kabahayang benepisyaryo ng programa noong 2010, umabot na sa halos 4 milyon na kabahayan sa ating pong administrasyon. [\r\n]\r\nMayroon pa po: Galing sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, mas malaki ng tinatayang 40 porsyento ang sinasahod ng mga naka-graduate ng high school, kumpara sa mga elementarya lang ang tinapos. Di po ba makatuwirang sagarin na natin ang tulong na ibinibigay natin sa mga pamilya, upang makumpleto na ng mga batang benepisyaryo ang high school, at sa gayon ay maisagad na rin ang benepisyo ng programang ito? Kaya nga po, sa susunod na taon, magiging saklaw na ng programa ang mga pamilyang may kabataang abot sa 18 taong gulang, upang hanggang sa high school ay makapagtapos na sila. [\r\n]\r\nSa edukasyon naman po: ang layunin nating itaas ang kalidad ng kaalamang natututuhan ng kabataan, upang matapos mag-aral ay mapanghawakan nila ang mga oportunidad na bumubukas sa ating lipunan: natupad po. Nabura na ang minana nating kakulangan sa libro at upuan, at kung magpapatuloy nga po ang pagpapakitang-gilas ni Kalihim Brother Armin Luistro, [\r\n] pati po ang kakulangan sa silid-aralan ay mabubura na rin sa taong ito. Ang magandang balita pa: May kakayahan na tayong paghandaan ang magiging pangangailangan dahil sa K to 12 program. [\r\n]\r\nHindi po biro ang dinatnang mga problema ni Brother Armin sa DepEd [Department of Education]. Isipin po ninyo, kada isang textbook, pinepresyuhan dati ng 58 pesos; nang siya na ang namumuno, bumaba ang presyo ng eksaktong libro sa 30 pesos. Paano po kaya kung dati pa nagbayad ng tamang halaga para sa mga aklat na ito? Kung natipid natin ang diperensyang 28 pesos, at may limang textbook ang bawat sa isang tinatayang 20.7 million na estudyante sa ating public school system, ang katumbas nito: halos 2.9 billion pesos. [\r\n] Kaya po sana nitong pondohan ang plano nating pagpapaayos at rehabilitasyon ng nasa 9,502 na silid-aralan.\r\nKung nagkulang sa lakas ng loob si Brother Armin, puwede namang ipamana na lang sa susunod sa kanya ang kultura ng pagwawalang-bahala sa kanyang ahensya. Puwede naman din pong ipamana na lang ang mga backlog; ipasa na lang sa susunod ang lolobong pagkukulang dahil sa dumaraming mga enrolee kada taon. Pero itong si Brother Armin, imbes na makuntento, imbes na sabihing, \u201cPuwede na \u2018yan, tapos na ang trabaho ko,\u201d gagawa pa siya ng mas maraming upuan at classroom, at bibili ng mas maraming libro, upang siguruhing pati ang para sa susunod na mga taon ay mapunuan na rin. [\r\n]\r\nAng pagpapalakas naman sa sektor ng agrikultura: natupad din. Isipin po ninyo, ayon sa NFA [National Food Authority]: Noong 2010, nag-angkat ang bansa ng mahigit dalawang milyong metriko tonelada ng bigas. Noong 2011, bumaba ito sa 855,000 metric tons. Noong 2012: 500,000 metric tons na lang. At ngayong 2013: Ang pinakasagad na nating aangkatin, kasama na ang pribadong sektor, ay ang minimum access volume na 350,000 metric tons. [\r\n] Nakapaloob na po dito ang 187,000 metric tons sa reserbang buffer stock sakaling magsunud-sunod ang bagyo; malamang, dahil on-target pa rin tayo sa rice self-sufficiency, hindi na rin kailangan pang mag-angkat ng pribadong sektor. Dagdag pa po diyan, nagsimula na tayong mag-export ng matataas na uri ng bigas. Ang layo na po talaga natin doon sa panahong sinasabing hindi raw natin kayang pakainin ang ating sarili. [\r\n]\r\nDatos na rin po ang pruweba: Lumago ng 3.3 percent ang sektor na ito sa unang tatlong buwan ng 2013. Triple po ang itinaas nito mula sa 1.1 percent growth noong parehong panahon ng 2012. Kaya naman, patuloy po tayong nagpupunla ng mga inisyatibang pihadong magbubunga ng higit na kaunlaran sa ating mga magsasaka.\r\nHalimbawa po, sa niyog. Ayon sa pagsusuri noong 2009, isa sa mga pinakamahirap na sektor sa bansa ang coconut farmers. Ang proseso ng pagsasaka nito: Pagkatanim, pitong taong hihintaying mamunga ang niyog, pero pagkatapos, dalawang henerasyon ang wala nang ibang kailangang gawin kundi mamitas na lang nang mamitas. May potensyal po tayong palakihin ang kita ng sektor na ito kung maglalatag tayo ng kulturang mas nang-eengganyo ng sipag at pagiging produktibo. Ang tugon: intercropping.\r\nTutulong ang gobyernong magpalakas sa iyong niyugan, kapalit ng obligasyong magpunla ng iba\u2019t ibang binhi sa pagitan ng mga hilera ng niyog. Mas dadalas ang ani ng magsasaka, at depende sa kanilang itatanim, lalaki ang kanilang kita. Kung sa niyog lang, sa bawat ektarya, nasa 20,000 piso po kada taon ang kinikita ng magsasaka. Kung dadagdagan ito ng kape, maaaring pumalo ng 172,400 pesos ang kita; kung saging, aabot sa 102,325 pesos ang maaaring kitain, samantalang 89,000 pesos naman sa cacao. Ang laking diperensya, di po ba?\r\nNasimulan na po nating ilatag ang mga inisyatiba para rito: Nitong 2012, umabot na sa 5,500 hectares ng lupain ang ginagamit natin para sa intercropping sa 90 lokasyon sa bansa. Saklaw po nito ang 10,000 sa ating mga magsasaka. Ang target naman natin ngayong 2013: dagdag pang 434 sites para sa coconut intercropping. [\r\n]\r\nItinitimon na rin po natin tungo sa mas produktibong pampang ang ating mga mangingisda. Isipin po ninyo: Pumalo sa 193.65 billion pesos ang ambag ng industriya ng pangingisda sa ating ekonomiya nitong 2012, pero sa kabila nito, 41 porsyento pa rin sa ating mga mangingisda ang maralita nang huli itong sukatin noong 2009. Sila ang nanghuhuli ng isda, pero ang natitira para sa kanilang pamilya, tinik na lang.\r\nKaya nga po: Nariyan ang maraming inisyatiba ng pamahalaan upang tulungang makaalpas sa lambat ng kahirapan ang ating mga mangingisda. Halimbawa nga po ang para sa Bataraza sa lalawigan ng Palawan. Sagana ang katubigan sa paligid nito. Pero dahil hindi mapaabot sa mga merkado nang sariwa ang isda, ginagawa na lamang itong tuyo. Sayang naman po, kasi sa bawat tatlong kilo ng lapu-lapu, isang kilo lang ang tuyong nagagawa. Paano kung mapahaba ang pagkasariwa ng isda dahil sa cold storage facility? Pupunta ka sa merkado nang sagad pa rin ang presyo ng huli mo. Parehong sikap sa paghuli, pero ang makukuha mo, tamang halaga. Kaya nga po, kasado na ang cold storage facility para sa Bataraza. [\r\n] Kasabay po nito, nagtatayo na rin tayo ng mga bagong pantalan sa mga stratehikong lugar upang mapalago pa ang produksyon at kita. Ipinapaayos natin ang mga kalsada, tulay, at iba pang imprastruktura, pati na ang serbisyo para sa ating mga mangingisda.\r\nMahigpit din pong binabantayan ng DILG [Department of the Interior and Local Government], BFAR [Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources], at Coast Guard ang pangingisda nang walang habas; ang hiling ko nga pong ambag sa ating mga mangingisda: Pagpahingahin natin ang mga dagat. Hinihikayat ko po kayong sumama sa pangangalaga ng inyong kabuhayan; nakikita naman po ninyo: Ang oportunidad, inilalapit na sa inyo ng estado, pero ang resulta, syempre, nasa kamay ninyo.\r\nKung may isa man pong paksang paboritong ikabit sa pangalan ko, ito ay ang Hacienda Luisita. Nais ko lang pong iulat na noong Pebrero, alinsunod sa utos ng Korte Suprema, nakumpleto na ng Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) ang listahan ng mga kuwalipikadong benepisyaryo na mabibigyan ng lupa sa Luisita. [\r\n] Ayon rin po kay Kalihim Gil de los Reyes, sinimulan na noong nakalipas na linggo ang pagtutukoy ng bawat loteng makukuha ng mga benepisyaryo, at magsisimula nang ipagkaloob ang mga titulo sa Setyembre nitong taong ito. [\r\n]\r\nPara naman po sa iba pang malalawak na lupain: Matagal na nating inatasan ang DAR, DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources], LRA [Land Registration Authority], at Land Bank na bumuo ng balangkas kung paanong mapapabilis ang pagproseso sa pagbabahagi ng lupain. Ipapaalala ko lang po: Tamang datos ang unang hakbang sa maayos na implementasyon ng CARPER. Pero nagmana po tayo ng isang depektibong land records system. Kaya simula pa lang po, nagtrabaho na ang DOJ [Department of Justice], LRA, DENR, at DAR para ayusin ang sistemang ito, at nasa punto na tayo ngayon kung kailan kaya nating siguruhin: Sa susunod na taon, naihain na ang lahat ng mga notice of coverage para sa mga lupaing saklaw ng komprehensibong repormang agraryo. [\r\n]\r\nMalinaw po: Ang estado, itinayo para paglingkuran kayo. Kung may problema sa kalusugan, dapat kumakalinga ang gobyerno; sa panahon ng sakuna, nariyan din dapat ito para magbigay-lingap. Ano po ba ang ginagawa natin sa mga larangang ito?\r\nSa kalusugan, ang layunin nating masaklaw ng PhilHealth ang mas marami pa nating kababayan: natupad na rin po. Dumating tayong 62 percent ng Pilipino ang naka-enrol sa programa; ngayon, nasa 81 percent na ito. Ang natitira nga pong wala sa talaan ay ang mga hinahanap pa, kabilang na po ang informal sector at mga katutubo. Inaasahan po natin ang pakikipagtulungan ng mga lokal na pamahalaan upang maisali na natin sa sistema ang lahat ng ating mamamayan. [\r\n]\r\nHindi lang po mga enrolee ng PhilHealth ang lumalawak, kundi pati ang mga benepisyong maaaring makuha mula rito. Noong nakaraang taon, inilunsad natin ang Z Benefit Package. At nitong Pebrero naman po, pinalawak pa ito ng Expanded Z Benefit Package. Mas mahaba na po ang listahan ng mga karamdamang libreng maipapagamot ng mahihirap nating kababayan sa mga pampublikong ospital. Noong isang taon, nakasama na ang breast cancer, prostate cancer, at acute leukemia; ngayon, kasama na rin ang iba pang sakit tulad ng coronary bypass, at ng pagtatama ng mga butas at maling posisyon ng mga ugat sa puso.\r\nMasasayang lang po ang ganitong benepisyo kung naghihingalo naman ang kalagayan ng ating mga pagamutan, at kung hindi naman ito mapuntahan ng mga nasa kanayunan. Kaya nga po todo buhos tayo ng budget sa imprastrukturang pangkalusugan: Nitong nakaraang tatlong taon, umabot sa 33 bilyong piso ang nailaan natin para sa pagpapatayo, pagpapaunlad, at rehabilitasyon ng 4,518 na ospital, rural health units, at barangay health stations sa buong bansa. [\r\n] Halimbawa na po rito ang Region I Medical Center sa Dagupan, na nakapagsagawa na ng limang kidney transplant ngayong taon; ang Bicol Regional Teaching and Training Hospital sa Legazpi, Vicente Sotto Medical Center sa Cebu, at Northern Mindanao Medical Center sa Cagayan de Oro, na ayon kay Secretary Ike Ona ay may kakayahan na ngayong magsagawa ng open heart surgery dahil sa mga bagong pasilidad at kagamitan. [\r\n] Nariyan din po ang Davao Regional Hospital sa Tagum City\u2014ang una nating cancer center sa labas ng Kamaynilaan.\r\nPara naman po sa paghahanda sa kalamidad: Ang layunin nating magpanday ng mga mekanismo upang mailayo sa peligro ang Pilipino: natupad na rin po. Nariyan po ang epektibong serbisyong bunsod ng pagsasanib-puwersa ng Geohazard Mapping and Assessment Program at Project NOAH [Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards]\u00a0naman ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology]. Nitong nakaraang taon, natapos na natin ang multihazard mapping ng dalawampu\u2019t walong pinakapeligrosong lugar sa bansa. Susunod na po rito ang para sa Greater Metro Manila Area na target nating kumpletuhin pagdating ng 2014. Handa na rin po ang geohazard maps para sa 496 na lungsod at munisipyo. Ang natitira pong 1,138 na sasaklaw sa bawat sulok ng bansa ay makukumpleto bago matapos ang 2015. Dagdag pa po, mas matalas at detalyado na ang mga mapa, kaya mas eksakto na ring natutukoy ang mga mapanganib na lugar. [\r\n]\r\nBuhat naman ng inilunsad ang Project NOAH noong nakaraang taon, nakapag-deploy na tayo ng 525 automated water level monitoring stations at automated rain gauges sa 18 major river basins sa atin pong bansa. Tuloy-tuloy din ang pamamahagi natin ng mga modernong kagamitan tulad ng Doppler radars, tsunami detectors, at alerting sirens.\r\nSubalit hindi po sapat ang basta pagbibigay lang ng makabagong gamit at teknolohiya. Sinasanay din natin ang mga makakatanggap nito kung paanong intindihin, gamitin, at palaganapin ang impormasyon. Kapag masama ang panahon, hindi na lamang bilis ng hangin ang kanilang basehan; alam na rin nila kung gaano karaming tubig ang bubuhos, at nakakapagbigay sila ng tama at napapanahong babala sa komunidad upang makapaghanda.\r\nInaayos na rin po natin ang problema sa madalas na pagbaha sa Kamaynilaan. Biruin po ninyo: Noong Ondoy, tinatayang 3,600 cubic meters per second ang tubig na dumaloy mula sa Sierra Madre. Pero ang kapasidad ng dadaanan nito, nasa tinatayang 1,000 cubic meters per second lang. Saan naman po pupunta ang diperensyang 2,600 cubic meters kada segundo? Ito po ang bugso ng tubig na nagpapaapaw sa mga mababang lugar at nagiging baha.\r\nDi po ba\u2019t narinig na ng marami sa atin: \u201cWaterways are inalienable.\u201d Ibig sabihin: Ang daanan ng tubig, para sa tubig lang. Ang problema nga po, kulang na nga ang dadaanan ng tubig, may mga gusali pang naghahadlang sa mga estero, at binabarahan pa ito ng basura ng mga tumitira sa paligid. Para po solusyunan ito, nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa mga LGU [local government unit] upang maayos na mailipat ang mga informal settlers. Inihahanda na rin po ng legal team sa pamumuno ni Secretary Leila de Lima ang mga kaso laban sa nagtayo ng mga gusali na sumara o humaharang sa mga daanan ng tubig. [\r\n]\r\nHindi po tayo makukuntento sa sisihan. Ang ating pong aksyon: 6.2 billion pesos para maiwasan ang pagbaha sa Kamaynilaan. Bahagi nito ang pagtatayo sa Blumentritt Interceptor Catchment area; 3.3 kilometers po ang haba ng buong proyekto, at oras na makumpleto, kaya nitong sumalo ng tubig na katumbas ng tinatayang 14 na Olympic-size swimming pool. Kaya kung may bubuhos man pong tubig, mayroon na itong pupuntahan, at hindi na kailangang nasa ibabaw ng lansangan. [\r\n] Nasimulan na po ang proyektong ito noong Marso; layunin nating matapos ito sa susunod na taon.\r\nGinagampanan po ng gobyerno ang kanyang obligasyon. Tanungin din po sana natin ang ating sarili: Ano ang inaambag ko sa solusyon? Kung may magtapon sa ilog, sitahin mo sana; kung may magtayo ng building sa estero, isumbong mo na. Lalo po tayong malulubog sa problema kung magkikibit-balikat lang po tayo.\r\nLumisan man ang bagyo, di naman humuhupa ang pagsisikap nating maibalik sa normal ang buhay ng mga pamilyang nasalanta ng mga nagdaang kalamidad. Sa pagtutulungan ng gobyerno at pribadong sektor, nasa 9,377 na kabahayan na po ang naipatayo para sa mga sinalanta ng bagyong Sendong. May karagdagan pang 4,374 na tahanang maipapatayo ng gobyerno bago matapos ang susunod na taon. [\r\n] Humihingi po tayo ng pag-unawa kung medyo nagtagal ito, dahil na rin sa masalimuot na proseso ng land acquisition; katunayan nga po, kung maaayos ang usapin sa iba pang lupain, may dagdag pang 2,719 na kabahayan ang maipapatayo natin.\r\nTarget naman po nating maipagkaloob ang kabuuang 53,106 na kabahayan para sa mga kababayan nating sinalanta ng bagyong Pablo. Nasimulan na po natin ang pamamahagi ng mga bagong bahay nitong Mayo. Tatapusin po natin ang 17,609 na kabahayan bago matapos ang taon, at oras na makumpleto na rin ang natitira pang 35,447 sa 2014, ang mga pamilyang tinamaan ng dahas ng kalikasan ay makakasilong na muli sa ilalim ng sariling bubong. [\r\n]\r\nTungkol din po sa pabahay, para naman sa ating unipormadong hanay: Ang 21,800 na housing unit para sa pulis at kasundaluhan\u2014natupad na, noong isang taon pa. Sa Phase II naman ng proyekto, naitayo na rin po ang halos 26,050 sa target na 31,200, na makukumpleto na sa susunod na buwan para naman sa Phase II.\r\nBukod sa pabahay, may mga programang pangkabuhayan din tayong binubuo para sa ating mga kawal. Ang ilang libong ektaryang lupain sa tatlong kampo-militar\u2014partikular na sa Fort Magsaysay sa Nueva Ecija, sa Camp Kibaritan sa Bukidnon, at sa Camp Peralta sa Capiz\u2014ay paglulunsaran ng dagdag na pagkakakitaan ng mga sundalo, gaya ng plantasyon ng kawayan, kape, cacao, at palm oil. [\r\n] Kung dati, nakatutok lamang sa tanggulan ang mga kawal, ngayon maski retirado ay may pagkakataong maging bahagi ng paglago ng ating ekonomiya.\r\nSubalit hindi dito nagtatapos ang paghahanap ng solusyon sa mga minana nating problema sa pambansang tanggulan. Isipin po ninyo: noong 1986, mayroon daw tayong 250,000 na pulis at sundalo para sa mahigit 55 million Filipinos. Ngayon po, mayroon pa rin tayong tinatayang 250,000 na pulis at sundalo, na nagbabantay sa 95 milyong Pilipino. Halos dumoble ang populasyon natin, pero hindi nagbago ang bilang ng nagbabantay sa atin.\r\nTiyak pong may mga nagsasabi na diyan: \u201cProblema ba ito? E di magdagdag kayo ng pulis at sundalo. Makakalikha pa kayo ng trabaho.\u201d Sana nga po ganyan lang kadali at kasimple ang solusyon. Tingnan po muna natin: Sa karaniwang pension scheme, maghuhulog ng kontribusyon ang miyembro at nag-eempleyo. Ito ang puhunang palalaguin, at dito magmumula ang pensyon sa pagreretiro ng miyembro. Pero ano po ba ang situwasyon sa pensyon ng AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] at PNP [Philippine National Police]? Walang naghuhulog, pero may kailangang bayaran. Dagdag pa rito, naka-index sa sahod ng mga aktibong sundalo at pulis ang pensyon ng retirado. Ibig sabihin, kapag lumaki ang sahod ng nasa serbisyo, lalaki rin ang pensyon ng mga retirado o ng mga pamilyang tumatanggap pa nito. Taun-taon, dumarami ang mga nagreretiro, kaya natural, pataas din nang pataas ang obligasyon. Ang masaklap, pambansang budget ang sumasalo nito: Noong 2012, 54.48 billion pesos ang inilaan para sa pensyon ng sundalo at kapulisan. Ngayong taon, 61.29 billion, at aabot po ito sa 80.64 billion sa 2016. Lolobo pa ito nang lolobo, kaya\u2019t liliit naman nang liliit ang pondo para sa iba pang serbisyong panlipunan. Paano naman po tayo magdadagdag pa ng pulis at sundalo kung ganito ang konteksto?\r\nKailangan ng sistemang tutugon sa obligasyon ng lipunan sa ating mga sundalo\u2019t kapulisan; malamang po, GSIS [Government Service Insurance System] ang hihilingan natin ng tulong para rito. Pinag-aaralan na rin po ang posibilidad na gamitin ang mga reclaimed area para makalakap ng pondong ipapasok sa papandaying solusyon. Hindi rin naman po natin puwedeng biglain ang pagtugon sa kabuuan ng ating mga pangangailangan, kaya\u2019t mas masinsin pang pagsusuri ang gagawin natin upang makalikha ng isang patas, pangmatagalan, at malinaw na mekanismo para sa mga pensyon ng mga pulis at sundalo. Nananawagan po ako sa Kongreso: Pag-aralan po nating muli ang PD 1638 at RA 8551 upang maiangkop sa panahon at sa pambansang pangangailangan ang pensyon at benepisyo ng ating pulis at kasundaluhan. [\r\n]\r\nKaparehong paninindigan rin po ang nakikita nating solusyon sa nakaambang problema sa pensyon sa SSS [Social Security System]. Isipin po ninyo: mula 1980, 21 times nang nagkaroon ng across-the-board pension increase\u2014ulitin ko lang po yun, 21 times\u2014pero ang masaklap po, dalawang beses pa lang pong tumaas ang contribution rate. Ang resulta: Tinatayang 1.1 trillion pesos na ang unfunded liability ng SSS base sa pag-aaral na isinagawa nitong 2011. Inaasahang tataas ito ng 8 porsyento kada taon, at mauubos ang pondo 28 years from now. Kapag nangyari ito, walang ibang malulugi kundi ang susunod na salinlahi ng Pilipino.\r\nNaniniwala po tayong panahon na para amyendahan ang SSS Pension Scheme. Kailangan nating tambalan ng inisyatibang mag-impok nang sapat ang pagluluwal natin ng pera. Kung magdadagdag lamang tayo ng 0.6 percent sa contribution rate, 141 billion pesos na agad ang maibabawas sa unfunded liability ng SSS. Kung ngayon na tayo magsisimulang mamuhunan sa kinabukasan, wala nang problemang ipapamana sa mga susunod sa atin. [\r\n]\r\nSa kapulisan naman po, ang layunin nating magbigay ng lakas upang magampanan nila ang kanilang tungkulin: natupad rin natin. Simula ngayong 2013, 30,000 sa mga pulis ang babalik sa pagpupulis, dahil kukuha tayo ng mga civilian personnel para gawin ang mga tungkuling administratibo. Sayang naman po ang kakayahan at abilidad ng ating mga kawal at pulis kung ikukulong lamang natin sila sa apat na sulok ng opisina.\r\nSa pagpasok rin po ng buwang ito, inumpisahan nang ipamahagi ang mga bagong unit ng 9mm Glock 17 pistols sa ating mga pulis. Simula pa lang po ito; kasado na rin ang pamamahagi ng kabuuang 74,879 na baril sa ating mga alagad ng batas, tungo sa katuparan ng mithiin nating one-is-to-one police-to-pistol ratio. [\r\n]\r\nSulit na sulit naman po ang pamumuhunan nating ito sa pambansang kapulisan, lalo pa\u2019t nagbubunsod ito sa maayos at maaasahang serbisyo. Di po ba\u2019t tuwing eleksyon, nasanay na tayo sa kaliwa\u2019t kanang insidente ng karahasan? Tinugunan po natin ito, tulad ng Oplan Katok. Ang pakay ng programa: hanapin ang mga baril na paso na ang lisensya, at tiyakin na ang mga mayroon lamang lisensya ay hawak pa rin ng otorisadong mamamayan. Para gawin ito, 491,929 na pintuan ang kinatok ng ating mga pulis para sa renewal ng mga lisensya. Nakatulong po ito upang maging mas epektibo ang kampanya natin para sa Secure and Fair Elections, kung saan ang 112 private armed groups noong eleksyon ng 2010 ay napababa na lang sa 41. Katumbas po ito ng 63 percent na pagbaba. [\r\n] Mula rin sa 189 na insidente ng karahasan noong eleksyon ng 2010, 77 na insidente lamang ang kompirmadong naganap nitong huling halalan. [\r\n]\r\nGawin po nating halimbawa ang ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]. Ang sabi nga po ni Governor Mujiv Hataman, sa tanang-buhay niya, hindi siya makaalala ng pagkakataon kung kailan walang failure of elections sa Lanao del Sur. Alalahanin po natin, ito ang unang beses na magkasabay ang pambansa at rehiyonal na halalan sa ARMM. Ang ibig pong sabihin, noon ay nakatutok ang buong pwersa ng estado sa iisang rehiyon, pero may failure of elections pa rin. Ngayong 2013, dahil buong bansa ang kinailangang tutukan, at lumawak ang kanilang responsibilidad, may mga nag-akalang lulubha pa ang sitwasyon sa halalan ng ARMM. Pero kita naman po ang laki ng ikinaganda nito: Naging malinis at tapat ang halalan sa ARMM; natuloy ang bilangan, natuloy ang proklamasyon ng mga may bagong mandato mula sa taumbayan. Dahil sa sipag ng ating mga pulis at kawal, at gayundin sa pakikiisa ng sambayanan, talaga naman pong ang eleksyon 2013 ay naging mas payapa at tahimik. [\r\n]\r\nGayumpaman, may mga insidenteng nagmamantsa pa rin sa dangal ng ating kapulisan. Nabalitaan na naman siguro natin ang nangyari sa mga miyembro ng Ozamiz Gang na sina Ricky Cadavero at Wilfredo Panogalinga: nahuli na, pero napatay pa. Tulad ng ginawa nating imbestigasyon sa nangyari sa Atimonan, sisiguruhin nating mananagot ang sinumang pulis o kung sino mang sangkot dito\u2014gaano man kataas ang kanilang ranggo. Kung sino man ang mga pasimuno dito: maghanda lang kayo. Malapit ko na kayong makilalang lahat. [\r\n]\r\nSa kabila ng ganitong mga kuwento, buhay na buhay po ang aking pag-asa sa hanay ng kapulisan. Hindi sila nagkukulang sa mabubuting halimbawa tulad ni PO3 Edlyn Arbo, na buong tapang na hinarap at tinugis ang isang holdaper sa nasakyan niyang jeep, [\r\n] off-duty man at walang dalang baril. Nariyan po siya at sinagupa yung holdaper, na nagkamaling siya ang pag-tripan. Nariyan din po si PO3 Felipe Moncatar na umani ng samu\u2019t saring papuri dahil sa haba ng listahan [\r\n] ng mga kriminal na kanyang nahuli, at ang balita ko ay may nahuli ka na namang batikang carnaper sa Bacolod\u2014talagang napakahusay mo. Ang ilan po dito sa kanyang mga nahuli kabilang sa pinaka-pinaghahanap na personalidad sa Bacolod at miyembro ng mga malalaking sindikato. Baka narinig na rin po ninyo ang kwento ni PO2 Dondon Sultan. May nasiraan ng kotse sa kahabaan ng Quezon Boulevard; tigil naman si Ginoong Sultan para tumulong. Hindi lang po siya nagpalit ng gulong; inihatid pa niya sa kasa ang nasiraan. [\r\n] Bilang pasasalamat sa kanyang serbisyo, sinubok abutan ng 1,000 piso si PO2 Sultan. Tinanggihan niya ito. Ang kanyang sagot: \u201cTrabaho naming tumulong sa mamamayan.\u201d [\r\n] Saludo po kami sa mga tulad ninyong lingkod-bayan. Patunay kayong hindi pa endangered species ang tapat at mahuhusay na pulis. Inatasan ko na sina Kalihim Mar Roxas ng DILG [Department of the Interior and Local Government], pati na rin si Kalihim Voltaire Gazmin ng DND [Department of National Defense], upang siguruhing ang mga katulad ninyo sa ating unipormadong hanay ay makakatanggap ng kaukulang pabuya at karangalan. Salamat pong muli. [\r\n]\r\nIdaragdag ko na rin po ang ating disaster relief workers mula sa maraming sangay ng gobyerno, pati na ang volunteers galing sa pribadong sektor. Alam ko pong hindi madaling lumusong sa baha, magbungkal ng putik, at humarap sa mukha ng pinsala. Hindi po ako magsasawang kilalanin ang inambag ninyo sa lipunan; saludo po ako sa pag-aalay ninyo ng sarili upang bawasan ang pagdurusa ng ating mga kababayan. [\r\n]\r\nAbot-kamay na rin po ang kapayapaan sa rehiyong matagal nang pinupunit ng hidwaan. Nitong Oktubre po ng nakaraang taon, nilagdaan ang Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro. Katunayan nga po, siyam na araw pa lang ang nakakalipas mula nang lagdaan ang ikalawang annex ng kasunduan. Kumpiyansa po tayong masusundan pa ito ng mas magandang balita sa lalong madaling panahon.\r\nTiyak kong mulat ang lahat: Hindi biro ang proseso ng pagbubuo ng consensus; mabuti na lamang talaga at handang makinig, magbigayan, at magkita sa gitna ang magkabilang panig. Alam naman natin ang maaaring maging resulta kung magpapadaan tayo sa inip. Ang malinaw po sa akin: Ang mga salitang ating bibitawan ay dapat magbunga ng mga kilos na positibong makakaapekto sa lahat. Ang bawat linya sa binubuo nating kasunduan ay dapat maaaring itaga sa bato, at hindi ililista lamang sa tubig upang anurin na naman ng kasaysayan. [\r\n] Pinalaki po ako ng aking ama nang may isang salita, kaya\u2019t sinasabi ko sa mga kapatid nating kasapi ng Bangsamoro: Anumang mapagkasunduan natin ay ipatutupad ng pambansang gobyerno. [\r\n]\r\nKailangan po ng tiwala sa usapan ng kapayapaan. Hindi automatic ang magkaroon ng tiwala, dahil na rin sa haba ng pinagdaanan. At ngayon, talagang dama na natin na gustong makipagkasundo ng magkabilang panig, at tayo naman ay nagpapakita na dapat talaga tayong pagkatiwalaan. At sa mga pumipigil sa pagkakaroon ng tiwala at naghahasik ng pagdududa: Masasabi mo bang Pilipino kang may malasakit sa kapwa mong Pilipino?\r\nUmaasa po ako sa pakikiambag ng bawat Pilipino sa layunin natin para sa Bangsamoro. Ipakita po natin sa kanilang hindi sila nagkamali sa pagpili sa direksyon ng kapayapaan; ipamalas natin ang lakas ng buong bansa upang iangat ang mga probinsya sa Muslim Mindanao, na kabilang sa mga pinakamaralita nating mga lalawigan. [\r\n] Tagumpay ng lahat ang ating hangarin; hindi tayo papayag na may kababayan tayong mapapag-iwanan habang may ibang nakakalamang. Nananawagan ako sa ating Kongreso: Nabuo na po ang Transition Commission na gagawa ng panukalang Bangsamoro Basic Law. Tatapusin ito alinsunod sa mga prinsipyo ng komprehensibong kasunduan para sa kapayapaan; maipasa po sana ninyo ito bago matapos ang 2014. [\r\n] Sa gayong paraan, may sapat tayong panahon para makapaghanda sa paghalal ng bagong pamahalaang Bangsamoro sa 2016.\r\nAnuman pong pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon ay naabot dahil hindi tayo nakuntentong sumunod lamang sa dinatnang status quo ng pamamahala. Matanong ko nga po: Ilan po ba sa inyo ang nakagamit ng tinatawag na Telepono sa Barangay? Hindi po ako magtataka kung wala. Isipin po ninyo, ayon sa DOTC [Department of Transportation and Communications]: Mahigit 5 billion pesos ang ginastos para sa isang programang magdadala ng telepono sa mga kanayunan. Di po ba\u2019t sayang lang ito, dahil sa loob ng maikling panahon matapos ang implementasyon, dahil hindi pa nga po tunay na tapos ang implementasyon niyan, dumami nang dumami ang may cellphone na Pilipino? Sino nga ba naman ang papansin sa mahigit 6,000 landline na ikinabit o ipinakabit nila, gayong may 100 milyon nang cellphone sa Pilipinas?\r\nHeto pa po ang isang halimbawa ng pag-iisip sa gobyerno na kinailangan nating baguhin: Bumili tayo ng walong combat utility helicopter, para daw sa mabilisang pagbiyahe ng ating mga sundalo. Ang problema: Sukat ba naman pong naka-mount ang baril sa may pintuan, at kailangang tanggalin kung may dadaan. Kung lalapag ka habang nagbabakbakan, ano ang silbi ng machine gun na nakatabi at hindi mapaputok? Wala bang nakaisip nito bago nagkapirmahan ng kontrata? Bakit naman po pinayagang mangyari ito?\r\nKailangan pong maging mas mahusay tayong mamimili. Hindi puwedeng palagi tayong nakasalalay sa sales talk ng mga supplier sa pagpili ng mga kagamitan natin. Inatasan natin ang DOST na bumuo ng grupo ng mga ekspertong hindi kayang bolahin ng mga supplier, lalo na po pagdating sa mga big-ticket items. Ang patakaran natin: Tamang pagkilala sa ugat ng problema; tamang pag-aaral na tutukoy sa tamang solusyon, na maaabot naman sa pamamagitan ng tamang metodolohiya. [\r\n]\r\nIyan po ang kaisipang pinagmulan ng ating tugon sa isyu ng mga informal settler sa Kamaynilaan. Kaya nga po, ang layunin nating ilayo sa panganib ang mga nagsisiksikan sa peligrosong bahagi ng lungsod: tinutupad na rin natin. Wala naman po sigurong kokontra kapag sinabi nating hindi tama ang kasalukuyan nilang kondisyon. Ayon po sa Article 2, Section 5, o ang general welfare clause ng ating Saligang Batas: \u201cDapat sundin ng Estado ang pagpapanatili ng kapayapaan at kaayusan, ang pangangalaga sa buhay, kalayaan at ari-arian, at ang pagtataguyod sa kagalingang panlahat upang matamasa ng buong sambayanan ang mga biyaya ng demokrasya.\u201d\r\nDito po natin napatunayan: Nakikinig sa katuwiran ang Pilipino; kapag ipinakita mong malasakit ang iyong batayang prinsipyo, handa tayong makiisa. Bago po magbaklas ng mga bubong at magtibag ng mga pader, ipinaliwanag natin ang katuwiran ng ating desisyon: Maayos ang lilipatan, malapit sa sakayan, at kung magsisikap kayo, hindi magkukulang ang inyong pagkakakitaan. Nilinaw din po natin: Layunin nating magbigay-lingap sa mga nasa peligro\u2014hindi sa sindikato. Batid nating sa tuwing inaabuso ng ilan ang pagmamalasakit ng estado, ipinapain rin nila sa alanganin ang buhay at kabuhayan ng napakaraming Pilipino.\r\nMatapos nga pong maibiyahe ang isang pangkat sa relocation site, sila mismo ang nanghikayat sa mga dati nilang kapitbahay: Sumama na kayo. Mas ligtas dito. Ngayong taon po, prayoridad nating ilipat ang mahigit 19,400 pamilyang nagsisiksikan sa mga pangunahing daluyan ng tubig sa Metro Manila. Sa pagkakapit-bisig ng DILG, NHA [National Housing Authority], DSWD, MMDA [Metropolitan Manila Development Authority], at DPWH, lumilinaw na po ang sagot sa suliraning ito.\r\nIsa pa pong halimbawa ng transpormasyon sa pamamahala: Di ba\u2019t matagal ding nabinbin sa Kongreso ang mahahalagang batas? Nito pong nakaraang taon, naisabatas na, sa wakas, ang Sin Tax Reform Law at ang Responsible Parenthood Law. [\r\n] Nagpapasalamat tayo sa mga naging kasangga natin sa pagsusulong nito sa Kamara at Senado. Hindi ninyo inalintana ang mahabang proseso ng debate at konsultasyon; hindi kayo nagpadaig sa mga naghasik ng pagdududa upang harangin ang ating mabuting agenda. Tinitimbang ninyo kung ano ang kapaki-pakinabang sa mas nakakarami, at isinusulong ang tunay na serbisyo para sa Pilipino. [\r\n]\r\nIlalapit ko na rin po sa ating Kongreso ang ilang batas na makakatulong sa pagpapatuloy ng nasimulan nating pagbabago. Maamyendahan na po sana ang Cabotage Law, upang mas mapalakas ang kumpetisyon, at mapababa ang gastos sa transportasyon [\r\n] ng ating mga sakahan at industriya. Maisulong na rin po sana ang Fiscal Incentives Rationalization Bill, upang maging mas tapat, malinaw, at may pananagutan ang mga insentibong ibinigay natin sa mga negosyante. [\r\n] Paglaanan din po sana ng panahon ang Land Administration Reform Bill, upang maitimon sa iisang direksyon ang mga kawanihang nakatutok sa ating mga lupain, at nang sa gayon ay masigurong masinop at epektibo nilang magagawa ang kanilang trabaho. [\r\n]\r\nBukas na bukas din po, ihahain natin ang panukalang 2.268 trillion pesos na national budget sa Kongreso. Kumpiyansa po ako sa suporta at pakikibalikat ninyo upang mapatibay ang pondong ito na talaga naman pong masusing pinag-isipan. Makakatulong ito hindi lang para ituloy ang agenda ng positibong pagbabago, kundi upang mapaspas pa ang pag-arangkada natin tungo sa malawakang kaunlaran.\r\nMay ilan pong nagsasabi na kailangang patibayin ang Sandatahang Lakas. Sang-ayon po ako dito. Pero tila ba ang gusto nila ay ilagak ang bawat sentimo ng kabang bayan para sa fighter jets, tangke de guerra, at iba pang gamit pandigma. Hindi yata nila alam na ang isang fighter jet na nagkakahalaga ng 1.58 bilyong piso, ay katumbas ng 6,580 na bahay para sa mga pulis at sundalo, o halos 2,000 na silid-aralan para sa mga kabataan. At ano naman ang magagawa ng isang pirasong jet? Para maging epektibo, ang kailangan, mga squadron\u2014at ang isa nito ay binubuo ng 24 na fighter jets. Sa halagang 1.58 billion pesos kada piraso, 37.92 billion pesos ang huhugutin sa kabang bayan para makabuo ng isang squadron. Paano naman ang missiles pati na rin ang practice missiles? Hindi rin po libre ang jet fuel, radar system, ground bases, at ground intercept controls. Hindi po talaga biro ang gastos para sa isang minimum credible defense posture; gagayahin pa ba natin ang iba, na handang kalimutan ang lahat para lang makuha ang nuclear option? Wala naman sigurong sasang-ayon dito. Babalansehin po natin ang ating mga pangangailangan. Aasikasuhin natin nang husto ang mga dapat tugunan sa ating lipunan, habang patuloy tayong nagiging mabuti at mahinahong kasapi ng pandaigdigang komunidad.\r\nAlam naman natin dati, ang batayan ng desisyon, puro pulitika. Gagawin ang lahat para kumapit sa kapangyarihan, kapalit ang pagdurusa ng kasalukuyan at susunod na henerasyon ng Pilipino. Tingnan po natin kung ano ang kinahantungan ng pag-ipit sa pagtataas ng pasahe sa LRT at MRT. Ang tinatayang gastos sa bawat biyahe ng pasahero ng LRT, 40 piso. Ang bayad ng pasahero, 15 piso. Ibig sabihin, sagot ng pamahalaan ang natitirang 25 piso. Sa MRT po, 60 piso ang totoong gastos: 15 piso sa pasahero, 45 piso sa gobyerno\u2014sa huli, bawat Pilipino, abunado. Nasa Mindanao ka o Visayas ka man, na ni minsan ay hindi nakatuntong sa LRT o MRT, kasama ka sa pumapasan nito.\r\nAng masaklap pa nga po: Dahil ipinamigay na ng nakaraang mga pinuno ang commercial development rights natin dito, bawat pisong maaaring makalap mula sa mga poster at billboard na nakapaskil sa stasyon o sa tren man, napupunta sa pribadong kumpanya kaysa sa gobyerno. Ang puwede sanang pagkunan ng pantustos sa maintenance at operasyon, nawala pa.\r\nSiguro naman po, makatuwirang ilapit man lang natin sa ibinabayad sa aircon bus ang pasahe ng LRT at MRT, upang maituon ang subsidiya sa iba pang serbisyong panlipunan.\r\nNakita naman po ninyo: Wala tayong balak magpamana ng problema sa susunod sa atin. Ang totoo nga po, ang mga proyektong dati\u2019y nilulumot lang, ngayon, napapakinabangan na ng mamamayan. Tingnan na lang natin ang Ternate-Nasugbu Road. Kung tutuusin, anim na kilometro lang ang haba ng kalsadang ito na nagkokonekta sa Cavite, Batangas, at Metro Manila, pero \u2018yang anim na kilometrong iyan, inabot pa ng halos 20 taon bago ito matapos. Binuksan na natin ang isang bahagi nito, at pag nakumpleto ang natitirang slope protection, ganap na ang magiging pakinabang ng kalsada sa mga motorista.\r\nNariyan din po ang Aluling Bridge sa Ilocos Sur. Taong 1978 pa po inilatag sa papel ang pagpapatayo nito. Siniguro na nating hindi lamang din papel ang mamanahin ng susunod sa atin: Nitong Marso, sa wakas, natapos na ito at sinimulan na rin natin noong nakaraang buwan ang operasyon ng Laguindingan Airport, na isang henerasyon naman ang pagitan mula nang inisip at isakatuparan. [\r\n]\r\nIlang dekada ring naghintay ang industriya ng semiconductors na magkaroon ng laboratoryong kayang makipagsabayan sa pasilidad ng ibang bansa. Hindi na po natin pinahaba ang kanilang paghihintay. Nitong nakaraang Mayo, sa pangunguna ng DOST, pinasinayaan natin ang Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory. Dati, kailangan pang ipadala ang mga produkto sa ibang bansa para suriin. Hindi natin nasasagad ang kita; hindi rin nasasagad ang potensyal ng industriya na manghikayat ng puhunan. Dahil po sa pasilidad na ito na tinaguriang ADMATEL, ngayon, dito na susuriin ang mga produkto, at masusulit ang mga bentahe ng manggagawang Pilipino sa larangan ng electronics. Inaasahan nga po nating lalo pang lalakas ang industriyang nag-ambag ng halos 44 percent ng ating exports noong 2012. [\r\n]\r\nSa tulong naman po ng ating Big Man sa Senado na si Manong Frank Drilon, [\r\n] natapos na ang mahigit 50 taon na paghihintay ng mga Ilonggo; nasimulan na ang Jalaur River Multipurpose Project II sa Iloilo. Ano po ba ang mga pakinabang nito?\r\nTinataya pong 24,000 magsasaka sa kalakhang Iloilo ang mahahatiran nito ng buong-taong irigasyon. Dahil dito, maaaring dumoble ang ani ng mga magsasaka ng palay. Linawin po natin: Ang sakop nitong 31,840 hectares ng lupaing mapapatubigan, may dagdag na aning bigas na 146,013 metric tons. Katumbas po ito ng halos 80 porsyento ng aangkatin nating buffer stock ng bigas para sa 2013. [\r\n]\r\nBukod pa po ito sa iba pang benepisyo ng proyekto tulad ng pag-iwas sa malawakang baha sa Iloilo, at ang dagdag na 6.6 megawatts ng hydropower. May ambag din ito sa supply ng tubig para sa ilang bahagi ng probinsya, at sa industriya ng ecotourism doon. Dagdag pa rito, nasa 17,000 trabaho ang malilikha ng proyekto; oras na maging fully operational naman ito, tinatayang 32,000 Pilipino ang mabibiyayaan ng sapat na pagkakakitaan. [\r\n] Una raw po inisip itong proyektong ito taong 1960. Nagsabay po kaming dumating sa mundong ito.\r\nMulat din po tayong marami sa ating mga kababayan ang nananabik na makita ang mga bunga ng ating Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. Alam din po nating may mga tila naiinip na sa kahihintay para rito.\r\nIsakonteksto po natin. Noong 2010, pag-upo natin sa puwesto, 6.5 percent na lang ng programmable budget ng taon, o 100 billion pesos lamang, ang iniwan sa atin. Ang 93.5 percent po, inilaan na sa kung saan-saan ng ating sinundan. Kaya naman, lumapit tayo sa pribadong sektor. Ang sabi natin: Kulang kami sa pondo, halina\u2019t mag-ambagan tayo upang maipatayo ang mga kinakailangang imprastruktura.\r\nMay balakid din po tayong kinaharap nang magsimula ang PPP. Luma na ang mga pag-aaral na basehan ng mga proyekto; kulang sa kaalaman ang burukrasya para ipatupad ito. Idagdag pa natin ang publikong nagsawa nang magtiwala sa mga kontratang pinapasok ng gobyerno.\r\nGayumpaman, sa anuman pong situwasyon, ang ating prinsipyo: Gagawin na lang din natin, gawin na natin nang tama. Wala tayong balak na pumasok sa kuwestiyonableng kontrata ngayon, para lang ipamana ang problema sa susunod na administrasyon. Kailangang dumaan sa tamang proseso ang bawat proyekto, para masigurong ang perang inyong pinaghihirapan ay napupunta sa dapat nitong kalagyan.\r\nNgayon pa lang, nakikita na natin ang epekto ng maayos, tapat, at hayag na paglalatag sa PPP projects. Dati, may isang paliparan lang na maipagawa, napakalaki nang balita. Ikumpara po natin ngayon: Bukod sa pinapakinabangan na ang paliparan sa Laguindingan, sabay-sabay din ang proseso ng pagsasaayos at modernisasyon ng Tacloban Airport, Bicol International Airport, New Bohol Airport, Mactan Airport, at Puerto Princesa Airport. Ang Daang Hari-SLEX link road ang pinakamabilis na PPP project na nai-award sa alinmang administrasyon, nang walang shortcut na dinaanan ang proseso. [\r\n] Ang mga ito, at ang napakarami pang ibang ipinapatayo at ipapatayong imprastruktura, ay manganganak ng isang lipunang hitik sa oportunidad.\r\nMahaba po ang listahan ng mga suliraning minana, at tinutugunan na natin. Halimbawa: Ang madalas na pag-brownout sa Mindanao. Mula\u2019t sapul pa lang, naglalatag na tayo ng solusyon para dito, ngunit batid nating ang problemang isang dekadang binalewala ay hindi masosolusyonan sa isang tulog lang. Sa ngayon, patuloy ang paggawa natin ng mga hakbang upang tugunan ang mga kakulangan at agarang pangangailangan. Nariyan po ang pagtulong natin sa electric cooperatives upang makapagpasok sila ng generator sets ng magpapabawas sa mga brownout. Magtutuloy-tuloy ito hanggang makumpleto na ang mga plantang magsu-supply ng kuryente sa rehiyon.\r\nPero hindi po talaga mauubos ang mga kontra. Kesyo tataas daw ang presyo ng kuryente kapag may gensets dahil diesel ang ginagamit. May hydropower ngayon dahil tag-ulan, kaya umuugong na naman ang reklamo laban sa mga genset. Pero pagpasok ng tag-init, tiyak, marami na naman pong magrereklamo sa walong oras ng brownout.\r\nSa ibang bahagi naman po ng Pilipinas, gusto nating magtayo ng mga planta. Habang umuunlad kasi ang ekonomiya, tumataas din ang konsumo natin ng kuryente, at kailangang dagdagan ang supply nito. Gusto ba nating kapag sinagad na ang mga pagkukunan, saka lang tayo gagawa ng planta? Ang pagawa po niyan dalawa hanggang tatlong taon bawat planta. Hindi po kabuteng basta na lang susulpot ang mga ito.\r\nKung maganda ang mungkahi, handa naman po tayong makinig, pero sana naman ay makuha ng mga miron ang kabuuang konteksto ng situwasyon. Halimbawa po ang planta sa Redondo, Zambales. Pina-TRO [temporary restraining order] dahil mas maganda raw ang renewable. Sinabi rin po ba nilang mas mahal itong ipatayo, at mas mahal din ang magiging presyo ng enerhiya? Sinabi po kaya nilang hindi nito kayang tugunan ang baseload, o ang kapasidad na kailangang laging nariyan para hindi mag-brownout? Magtatayo ka ng wind; paano kung walang hangin? Kung solar, paano kung makulimlim? Lilinawin ko lang po: Naniniwala rin ako sa renewable energy at suportado natin ito, pero dapat ding may mga baseload plant na sisigurong tuloy-tuloy ang daloy ng kuryente sa ating mga tahanan at industriya. \u00a0Mag-iingay pa rin po kaya ang mga kumokontra, kung busy na sila sa kapapaypay dahil nag-brownout na? [\r\n] Ang sa akin lang po: makiambag sana tayo sa paghahanap ng solusyon.\r\nTutal din po, nagtatapatan tayo: Pag-usapan naman natin ang pagsasaayos ng NAIA 3. Masalimuot po ang usapang ito. Dumaan na ito sa dalawang arbitration; naipanalo na sana natin pareho, pero binaliktad ang desisyon sa isa dahil sa technicality. Kaya nga po ngayon, pinaghahandaan ang muling pagdinig nito. Dagdag na komplikasyon po ang isyu ng warranty sa pagpapatapos ng NAIA 3\u2014hindi naman puwedeng \u2018pag may umusbong na depekto, pasensyahan na lang, dagdag-gastos pa. Kaya nga po nang ipinaliwanag sa atin na bibigyan tayo ng maayos na warranty ng orihinal na contractor, pumayag tayo. Pero gusto nating manigurado; gusto nating kumpletuhin nang tama at buo ang proseso, at hihingin ko po ang inyong pag-unawa ukol sa isyung ito.\r\nMalinaw na po ngayon: Iisa ang tuon ng bawat metro kuwadrado ng sementong ibinubuhos natin bilang pundasyon ng mas maunlad na bansa: Pakinabang sa bawat isa\u2014hindi politika. Kung dati, gumagawa ng kalsada kung saan lang kursunada, at nagpapatayo ng tulay kung saan kaibigan ni Madam si Mayor, ngayon, sumusunod na tayo sa isang pambansang plano. Walang paborito, walang transaksyunalismo, walang padrino; bawat piso, nakatuon sa ating pagpaspas tungo sa malawakang pag-unlad.\r\nAng maaasahan po natin sa mga susunod na taon: mga paliparan at daungang lalapagan ng kalakal at turista; mga kalsadang sisigurong husto ang pakinabang ng lahat sa malalaking proyektong ito; mga power plant na pagmumulan ng sapat na kuryente at magpapatakbo sa mga industriya. Ito ang magsisilbing balangkas na magsasanga ng iba pang inisyatibang dadaluyan ng oportunidad para kay Juan at Juana dela Cruz\u2014mula sa mga magsasakang may sapat nang patubig at mabilis nang naibebenta ang ani, hanggang sa mga construction worker na nagtitindig ng mga bagong gusali; mula sa patuloy na pag-usbong ng mga call center, hanggang sa pagdami ng mga negosyanteng handang magpasok ng kapital sa bansa. Nagsulong tayo ng mga tamang proyekto sa tamang halaga; ginawa natin ito nang may tamang kalidad; at natapos o matatapos ito sa tamang panahon, dahil tama at karapat-dapat ang mga taong nagpapatupad nito.\r\nPag-usapan po natin ang trapiko: Di po ba\u2019t tinatayang 2.4 billion pesos ang nawawala sa ating ekonomiya kada araw, dahil sa buhol-buhol na trapik sa Kamaynilaan? Kabilang sa mga proyekto nating pihadong magpapaluwag dito ay ang Integrated Transport System. Ang mga bus na nagsisiksik sa mga kalsadang punung-puno na nga, ginagawan natin ng terminal sa mga lugar na hindi kasing-sikip. Napapakinabangan na nga po ang terminal sa Para\u00f1aque, at nakapila na rin ang sa Quezon City at Muntinlupa. Ang pamprobinsyang bus ay hanggang dito nalang sa mga terminal na ito ng wala nang makipagsiksikan sa EDSA.\r\nAt nariyan din po ang dalawang connector road na magdurugtong sa North at South Luzon Expressway. Ang totoo nga po, dekada sitenta pa lang, plano nang ipatayo ang tinawag nilang Metro Manila Highway. Ito sana ang magkokonekta sa dalawang expressway, upang hindi na kailangang bunuin ang ilang oras na biyaheng babagtas pa sa kahabaan ng EDSA. Ang problema po: Nag-atas si Ginoong Marcos ng mga batas na pabor sa kanyang crony. Nakatali tayo sa pagsunod sa mga batas na ito: Sino mang magpatayo ng imprastruktura sa lugar na iyon, dapat kasosyo ang korporasyon ng kanyang kaibigan. Masaklap po: nae-extend ng 30 taon ang kanilang prangkisa sa tuwing magkakabit sila ng kahit isang dipa lang ng kalsada sa orihinal. Dagdagan pa po natin: nang kumita ang kumpanya, hindi nakumpleto ang pagpapalawig o pagpapaunlad sa mga imprastraktura\u2019t daan. Tandaan po n\u2019yo na dapat umabot sa Carmen, Rosales, sa Pangasinan at Lucena sa Quezon ang mga kalsadang nabanggit at yung Metro Manila Highway o Expressway, hanggang ngayon wala pa. \u00a0Nang nalugi naman, nakuha pang ipasa sa gobyerno ang utang. Ilalapit ko na po ito sa ating Kongreso: Silipin po nating muli ang Presidential Decrees 1113 at 1894.\r\nSa kabila nito, tuloy po ang mga proyekto natin. Mayroon tayong walong kilometrong four-lane elevated expressway na kokonekta sa C3 Road sa Caloocan patawid ng Espa\u00f1a, hanggang sa PUP [Polytechnic University of the Philippines] sa Sta. Mesa. Mayroon ding mahigit 14 kilometrong six-lane elevated tollway na babagtas mula Balintawak, hanggang Buendia, sa Makati. Ang Common Alignment naman po ng dalawang kalsadang ito, lima\u2019t kalahating kilometrong six-lane elevated expressway mula PUP sa Sta. Mesa, patawid sa kalagitnaan ng Osme\u00f1a at Quirino Avenue, hanggang Buendia sa Makati. Oras na mabuksan ang kalsada, ang biyaheng SLEX hanggang NLEX na dati\u2019y inaabot ng dalawang oras, kaya nang takbuhin ng 15 minuto. Ang Clark naman hanggang Calamba na pumapalo noon sa tatlong oras, halos mangangalahati at magiging 1 oras at 40 minuto. [\r\n] Kada araw, tinatayang 55,000 motorista ang makikinabang sa mga ito. Tipid sa oras, tipid sa gas, menos sa polusyon, lalago pa ang komersiyo\u2019t turismo. Talaga naman pong win-win situation, di po ba?\r\nSa loob nga po ng tatlong taon, pinatunayan nating ang mga ahensyang dati\u2019y pugad ng kurapsyon ay maaaring maging ehemplo ng tapat at epektibong paglilingkod. Ilan po sa mga simple ngunit epektibong pagbabagong isinagawa ni Secretary Babes Singson ng DPWH: Wala nang letter of intent, na ginagamit ng mga bidder para magkuntsabahan; pinasimple ang proseso ng bidding, kaya mas marami nang nagkukumpitensya para sa proyekto, at mas sulit na ang presyong nakukuha ng gobyerno. Nasa oras na ring magbayad ang gobyerno, kaya mas nae-engganyo ang mahuhusay na contractor na makiambag sa pagtatayo ng pambansang imprastruktura. Dahil sa tapat na pamamahala, 18.4 billion pesos na ang natitipid ng DPWH, na inilalaan para sa iba pang makabuluhang proyekto. [\r\n]\r\nBilang halimbawa ng resulta ng mabuting pamamahala, tingnan natin ang Tagumbao Bridge sa Gerona, Tarlac. Sa totoo lang, congressman pa lang po ako, iminungkahi ko na ito. May mga nasasakupan kasi tayong kailangan pang umikot ng dalawang bayan para tawirin ang umaapaw na ilog tuwing tag-ulan. Sabi ko nga po sa mga dating administrasyon: Sa inyo na ang buong PDAF [Priority Development Assistance Fund] ko, magawa lang ito. Kung puwede sana installment plan. Pero wala pong nangyari. Lumawak lang ang idurugtong ng tulay dahil sa nababakbak na pampang.\r\nKasalukuyan na po nating ginagawa ang Tagumbao Bridge. At heto po ang kuwento ngayong tayo na ang nagpapatupad nito: Nasa 334 million pesos ang aprubadong pondo; pero dahil sa tamang pangangasiwa\u2019t tapat na paggugol, naibaba ito sa 226 million pesos. [\r\n] Suma-tutal, nakatipid tayo ng mahigit 108 million pesos nang hindi isinasakripisyo ang kalidad ng ipinapagawang tulay. At lalong maganda pa nga po, ang natipid na pondong ito ay magagamit sa pagpapagawa ng dike at river training works para sa Phase II ng proyekto.\r\nDumako naman po tayo sa turismo. Ayon sa banyagang pahayagang\r\n, the \u201cBest Tourist Destination of 2012\u201d tayo. \u00a0Para namang na-inlove ang\r\nsa ating bansa, nang binansagan nila tayong \u201cMost Romantic Destination of 2012.\u201d [\r\n]\u00a0Hopefully they will love us more.\u00a0Sabi naman ng\r\n, \u201cBest Diving Destination\u201d ang Pilipinas. [\r\n] \u201cBest Island\u201d\u00a0naman daw ang Palawan, kung tatanungin ang\r\n. Kulang na nga lang po ay tawagin na tayong paraiso. [\r\n]\r\nHindi na po nakakapagtakang sa mauugong na papuring tulad nito, naitala natin noong 2012 ang 4.3 million tourist arrivals sa ating bansa\u2014isang panibagong record high; 21.4 percent na po ang inilalago ng numerong ito mula nang pumasok tayo noong 2010, kung kailan nasa tinatayang 3.1 million na turista pa lang ang bumibisita sa atin. Pagdating naman sa ating domestic travelers, ang target natin dati para sa taong 2016 ay 35.5 million tourists. Pero nitong 2011 pa lamang po, nalampasan na natin ito sa 37.5 million domestic tourists. [\r\n] Ngayon po, sa momentum nating ito, tiwala tayong maaabot ang bagong target na 56\u2014ulitin ko po\u201456.1 million bago matapos ang 2016. [\r\n]\r\nAng mas malakas na sektor ng turismo, manganganak ng mas maraming trabaho. Tinataya ng DOT [Department of Tourism] na nakapag-ambag ang turismo ng 3.8 million na trabaho noong 2011. Ang totoo nga po, hindi lang mga lugar na may magagandang tanawin ang nakikinabang sa pagdayo ng turista, kundi pati ang mga karatig-bayang maituturing na tourism support communities: Ang mga lugar na pinanggagalingan ng pagkaing inihahanda sa mga resort, ng mga souvenir na ibinebenta, at ng iba pang mga produkto\u2019t serbisyong nagsisilbing bukal ng kaunlaran para sa mga lalawigan.\r\nMalamang, narinig na rin po ninyo ang mga good news na lumapag kamakailan sa bansa. Noong Marso, inalis po ng International Civil Aviation Organization ang significant safety concerns na ipinataw sa Pilipinas. Bunga po ito ng mga reporma sa aviation industry upang siguruhing pasok sa pandaigdigang pamantayan ang aviation safety sa Pilipinas. [\r\n] Dahil po dito, sa wakas, noon lamang ika-10 ng Hulyo, muli nang pinahintulutan ng European Union ang direktang paglipad ng ating flag carrier sa Europa. [\r\n]\r\nIsipin po ninyo, paano kaya kung dati pa inayos at pinalakas ang ating aviation industry? Di po ba\u2019t sayang ang pagbisita ng mga turistang nawalan ng ganang dumalaw sa Pilipinas dahil dito? Naglahong trabaho, pondo, at oportunidad\u2014ito ang resulta ng lumang sistema ng pamamahala.\r\nKaya naman, simula\u2019t sapul, nilabanan na natin ang katiwalian sa lahat ng antas ng pamahalaan at isinulong ang transpormasyon sa ating mga institusyon. Ang resulta: tunay na serbisyong pampubliko.\r\nTingnan na lang po natin ang lalim ng transpormasyong nangyari sa mga GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation]. Ang dating mga kumpanya ng bayang inaambagan mo pa dahil sa pagkalugi, naghahatid na ng dibidendo ngayon. Gamitin po nating halimbawa ang Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA). Sa loob ng 13 taon bago tayo dumating, ang suma-total ng dibidendo ng PRA: 676.82 million pesos. Sa tuwid na daan, para sa 2012 lamang, ang dibidendo nila: 1 bilyong piso. Napakalaking transpormasyon, di po ba? [\r\n]\r\nMabuting halimbawa rin ang Local Water Utilities Administration. Noong 2011, ang recorded net loss ng naturang GOCC: 950 million pesos. Pero dahil sa maayos na pangangasiwa, di lang nila nagawang balansehin ang kanilang mga libro; ayon sa kanilang report, umabot ang kanilang kabuuang kita sa 870 million pesos noong 2012. [\r\n] Dahil dito, nagawa nilang makapag-remit ng 365 million pesos sa pamahalaan para sa taong iyon.\r\nIsa pa pong halimbawa: Sa una kong SONA, isiniwalat natin ang kuwestyunableng kalakaran sa MWSS [Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]: Patung-patong na bonus at allowance ang ibinigay sa sarili, sa kabila ng kapalpakan nilang tugunan ang pangangailangan ng ating mga kababayan. Ang ahensya na nga po ang nag-ulat: Umabot sa 34 million pesos ang pagkalugi ng MWSS noong 2010. Hindi ito katanggap-tanggap. Kaya noong 2011, pinirmahan natin ang GOCC Governance Act, na nagsisilbing saligan ng katapatan, kredibilidad, at pananagutan sa pamamalakad ng ating mga GOCC. Ang ibinunga nito: Noong 2011, 333 million pesos ang kinita ng MWSS mula sa pagkalugi ng 34 million pesos. [\r\n] Noong 2012 naman po, ang kinita nila: halos 2 bilyong piso. Kakambal nito, lumago rin ang kanilang dibidendo: [\r\n] mula sa 150 million pesos noong 2011, umakyat ito sa 345 million pesos para sa 2012. Nakakalungkot nga po, na kung ano ang lalim ng pagbabagong itinanim ng mga pinuno ng MWSS, iyon din naman ang dumi ng putik na ibinabato sa kanila ng mga gusto pa ring kumapit sa lumang sistema.\r\nKaakibat ng pagtaas ng kumpiyansa sa ating mabuting pamamahala, ang patuloy na pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya. Ang resulta: Dalawang magkasunod na 10-place jump sa Global Competitiveness Index ng World Economic Forum. Sa unang pagkakataon, nakuha natin ang investment grade status mula sa dalawa sa tatlong pinakatanyag na credit ratings agencies sa mundo, at hindi malayong sumunod ang ikatlo. [\r\n] Napanatili ang stabilidad ng presyo ng mga bilihin, at patuloy din ang pagbaba ng bahagi sa ating budget na pambayad-utang, at ang paglaki naman ng pondong nailalaan sa mga serbisyong panlipunan. Sa panahong matamlay ang pandaigdigang ekonomiya, nagpamalas tayo ng kahanga-hangang 6.8 percent GDP [gross domestic product] growth noong 2012. Nahigitan pa natin itong first quarter ng 2013, kung kailan naitala ang paglagong 7.8 percent\u2014pinakamataas na recorded GDP sa Timog-Silangan, [\r\n] pati na sa Silangang Asya. Special mention po dapat ang 28.5 percent na ambag ng manufacturing sa inilaki ng ating ekonomiya. Inaasahan po nating aarangkada pa ang manufacturing sa mga darating na panahon.\r\nTinagurian na po tayo ngayon bilang \u201crising tiger,\u201d ayon sa World Bank; \u201cbrightest spark,\u201d ayon sa pahayag ng Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, at iba pang mga bansag na tumutukoy sa transpormasyong nangyayari sa ating bansa. Mula sa matuwid na paggugol ng pondo, hanggang sa epektibong koleksyon ng buwis; mula sa pagpapaunlad ng imprastruktura hanggang sa maaliwalas nang pagnenegosyo na lumilikha ng trabaho, talaga namang malinaw ang pahayag natin sa mundo: Kaya nang makipagsabayan ng Pilipinas sa agos ng kaunlaran.\r\nHindi lang po sa ekonomiya o stadistika nakikita ang transpormasyon ng ating lipunan. Ngayon, alam na ng Pilipino: Mayaman ka man o mahirap, may kakilala sa poder o wala, kapag gumawa ka ng mali, mananagot ka. Tunay nang nakapiring ang katarungan. Hindi mababali ang atas ng ating mga Boss: Panagutin ang tiwali, at itama ang mali sa sistemang kay tagal nagpahirap sa ating bayan.\r\nPinapanagot na po natin ang dating namumuno ng TESDA dahil sangkot siya sa katakut-takot na tongpats sa ahensya. Halimbawa: Ang isang incubator jar, nagkakahalaga ng 149 pesos. Pero kay Ginoong Syjuco ayon sa mga datos 15,375 pesos. Ang normal na presyo ng dough cutter, 120 pesos. Ang presyo kay Ginoong Syjuco: 48,507 pesos. Linawin po natin, dough cutter po ito, at hindi Hamilton Class Cutter. Baka nga po kapag hinarap na niya ang kasong isinampa ng Ombudsman, matuto nang magbilang itong si Ginoong Syjuco.\r\nNakahabla po ang dating mga opisyal ng PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation] na naglustay ng 26.7 million pesos para lamang gumawa ng pelikula; nagsunog ng 186 million pesos para sa isang partylist; at nagawa pang gamitin na pampapogi sa kampanya ang rice donations na nakalaan sana para sa mga biktima ng kalamidad.\r\nHinaharap na rin po ng mga dating pinuno ng PNP ang paratang ukol sa 131.6 million pesos na nawaldas para sa 75 depektibong rubber boat, at 104.99 million pesos para sa maanumalyang pagbili ng mga segunda-manong helicopter mula 2009 hanggang 2010. Mas mainam nga po kung masagot nila nang tama ang mga tanong ukol dito, nang matukoy natin kung may iba pang dapat managot.\r\nSa usaping Cadavero, PDAF, MRT 3, at iba pa: Dahil hindi alam ng ilang kritiko ang ginagawa namin, palagay nila wala kaming ginagawa sa mga isyung ito. Kung wala pang tangan na datos ang gobyerno at ipagsigawan naming, \u201cIimbestigahan namin kayo,\u201d di ba\u2019t para na rin naming sinabi sa mga kakasuhan na, \u201cPakitago naman po \u2018nyo nang mahusay ang lahat ng ebidensya?\u201d\u00a0Kaya tutungo tayo kung saan tayo ituturo ng katotohanan; ebidensya ang magdidikta sa ating mga hakbang.\r\nNang inihayag nating \u201cwalang wangwang,\u201d hindi lang natin binaklas ang mga sirena ng mga naghahari-harian sa kalsada; binungkal din natin ang kultura ng katiwalian na noo\u2019y tila nakaugat na sa mga pampublikong institusyon.\r\nPero magtapatan po tayo: Hanggang ngayon, may ilan pa ring ahensya ng gobyerno na ayaw yata talagang tumino. Nakakadismaya po ang lalim at ang pagsanga-sanga ng kanilang mga galamay sa ating burukrasya; malingat lang tayo, pihadong may aabusuhin at bibiktimahin na naman sila. Magpangalan na po tayo: sa Bureau of Immigration, paulit-ulit nating pinagsabihang ayusin ang pagbabantay sa ating mga daungan at paliparan. Pero paanong nakalabas ng bansa ang magkapatid na Joel at Mario Reyes, ang mga pangunahing suspek sa pagpaslang kay Gerry Ortega? Bakit nangyari pa rin na kitang-kita sa mismong CCTV ang pagtakas ng Koreano na si Park Sungjun? Wanted po siya sa Korea, at nanghingi ng tulong ang kanyang gobyerno upang hulihin siya. Anong mukha naman po ang ihaharap natin gayong mismong mga kawani ng ating gobyerno ang naghatid sa kanya at hinayaan siyang makatakas?\r\nNakakatuyo din po ng pasensya ang kultura ng \u201cpwede na\u201d sa National Irrigation Administration. Imbes na maglatag ng plano para sa mga bagong patubig, kuntento na sila sa paulit-ulit na rehabilitasyon ng mga irigasyon. Masabi lang na may nagawa, kahit puro patsi-patseng trabaho, masaya na sila. Noon nga pong kanilang anibersaryo, itinanong ko kung bakit nasa 60 percent na naman lang ang kanilang target ang naabot noong 2012, kung umabot na sila sa 87 percent noong 2011. Kinabukasan, nagkita kami ng kanilang magaling na administrador sa NEDA [National Economic and Development Authority] Board meeting. Ang sabi niya sakin, \u201cSir, ang dahilan kaya 60 percent lang, 40 percent daw po kasi ng target nila ay para sa Mindanao, bagyong Pablo ang dumating at tinamaan kaya na-delay sila ng 40 percent.\u201d Kailan po ba tumama ang Pablo? Noong unang linggo ng Disyembre. Ibig sabihin, binalak niyang tapusin ang 40 percent ng kanyang trabaho para sa taon, sa loob lamang ng tatlong linggo. Hindi po natin kailangan ng ganitong uri ng pamamahala sa loob ng burukrasya.\r\nPara namang nakikipagtagisan sa kapalpakan itong Bureau of Customs. Imbes na maningil ng tamang buwis at pigilan ang kontrabando, parang walang pakundangan ang pagpapalusot nila ng kalakal, pati na ng ilegal na droga, armas, at iba pa sa ating teritoryo. Tinataya nga po ng Department of Finance na mahigit 200 billion pesos ang kita na dumudulas lang at hindi napupunta sa kaban ng bayan. Saan po kayo kumukuha ng kapal ng mukha ang mga kawani sa ahensyang ito? [\r\n] Marami pong gabi bago ako matulog, talaga pong aking iniisip, kulang na lang ay sabihin nilang, \u201cWala akong pakialam kung mapunta sa masasamang loob ang armas; wala akong pakialam kung ilang buhay ang masira ng droga; wala akong pakialam kung habambuhay na matigang ang mga sakahan. Ang mahalaga, yumaman ako; bahala ka sa buhay mo.\u201d Hindi maaaring ganito ang kalakaran sa pamahalaan. Kung hindi mo nagagawa ang iyong trabaho, hindi ka karapat-dapat na manatili sa pwesto. [\r\n]\r\nKung matino kang kawani ng Bureau of Immigration, ng National Irrigation Administration, ng Customs, o ng kahit ano pang ahensya ng gobyerno, sana makiambag ka pa lalo. Hindi sapat na yumuko sa loob ng cubicle; bahagi ng trabaho mo ay ang pagpigil sa mali. Nasa tama kayo, kaya\u2019t huwag po kayong magtago; padaliin ninyo ang pagnanais kong mahanap kayo; paaangatin ko kayo nang paaangatin upang ibandila ang inyong mabuting ehemplo, at mabago na ang maling kultura sa inyong mga naturang ahensya. [\r\n]\r\nPara naman po sa mga kawaning walang balak tumalikod sa kulturang wangwang: Tapos na ang pakikiusap. Nagkaroon kayo ng tatlong taon para ipakitang handa kayong umayos; ngayon, hahanapin, kung hindi pa kayo nahahanap, pero \u2018yung di ko pa nahanap, lalahatin na po natin kayong lahat; ngayon, pasensyahan tayo.\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nIsabay na rin po natin sa pagbabago ang tiwaling mga miyembro ng Civil Service. Panahon pa lang po ng nanay ko, narinig ko na ang hirit na, \u201cAno ngayon kung utos ng Malaca\u00f1ang? Anim na taon lang kayo diyan.\u201d Kailangan pong itama ang ganitong klaseng pag-iisip. Nananawagan po ako sa Kongreso: Suriin natin ang ating Civil Service Code at PD 1, [\r\n] upang maisaayos ito sa lalong madaling panahon. Suportado ko ang pagbuo ng mekanismong magbabalik sa dangal ng serbisyo-publiko; na tanging mga tapat, mahuhusay, at may prinsipyong mga lingkod-bayan lamang ang maaaring makapasok at manatili sa gobyerno.\r\nNgayon naman po, hayaan natin ang ating mga kababayang magpahayag ng transpormasyong nangyayari sa lipunan:\r\n\u201cAko po si Violeta S. Abuque. \u2018Yong buhay po namin noong walang Pantawid Pamilya, dahil nga sa hirap ng buhay, wala kang puwedeng lapitan, wala kang puwedeng gamitin na pera. Saan ka lumapit, walang puwedeng magpahiram sa\u2019yo dahil sila rin po, mahirap rin sa buhay.\r\n\u201cLaking tuwa po namin nang biglang nagkaroon po ng programa \u2018yong DSWD, naabot po kami sa kabundukan. Magiging katuwang ko siya para makapag-aral nang maayos ang mga bata.\r\n\u201cNamulat po talaga kami na kailangan palang tustusin \u2018yung mga bata sa pag-aaral, para hindi na magaya sa mga ninuno namin na kahit pangalan lang po ay hindi maisulat.\r\n\u201cNagpapasalamat po talaga ako, unang-una, sa Pantawid Pamilya, sa mga sumuporta po nito.\u201d\r\n\u201c\u2018Yong dati\u2019y sila\u2019y pumapasok noon na medyo walang baon. Eh noong magkaroon na kami, may baon na sila, nag-aalmusal na.\r\n\u201cKailangan \u2018yong kasama doon sa kasunduan, magampanan mo talaga. Siyempre, kailangan pagyamanin mo rin \u2018yong tulong niya, gumawa ka rin ng paraan kung paano mo pa madadagdagan. Kaya gumagawa kami ng anak ko, tulong kami, ng peanut butter binebenta namin linggo-linggo.\r\n\u201cNagpapasalamat po ako na napabilang ako sa isa sa Pantawid na programang ito, kasi malaking tulong po ito sa aming pamilya.\u201d\r\n\u201cPara matustusan din po \u2018yong paghahanap ko ng trabaho, nagbalik po ako bilang magbabalut. May free training daw si TESDA. Binasa ko \u2018yong impormasyon tungkol doon, at hanggang sa magpa-register po ako. Masaya po ako sa naitulong ng TESDA program, dahil, ito na, nalaman ko na kung ano siya, \u2018yong trabahong ginugusto ko. At saka, nagagamit ko na siya ngayon sa ikauunlad ko pa at ikatututo ko pa, habang ginagawa ko po \u2018yong trabaho ko.\r\n\u201cApril 2 po, 6:45 ng umaga, papunta po ako ng PCCR review center. May nakasakay po ako na holdaper sa jeep. Sa taas po ng Nagtahan flyover, nag-declare po siya ng holdup. Tinutukan niya po ako ng kutsilyo. Nakipaglaban po ako, nasaksak niya po ako sa hita, naagaw ko po sa kanya \u2018yong kutsilyo, at noong bago po siya bumaba ng jeep, nasaksak ko po siya sa likod. Pagbaba po niya ng jeep, hinabol ko po siya, parehas po kaming duguan. \u2018Yun po siguro \u2018yong nakatawag pansin po sa taong-bayan para mahuli po yung holdaper.\r\n\u201cInisip ko rin po \u2018yong sinumpuang serbisyo ko sa taong-bayan. Sa kapwa ko pulis: Gumawa lang po tayo ng tama, at kung ano \u2018yong mabuti para sa kapakanan ng ating bayan\u2014at the same time po, magiging reflection ng ginagawa natin sa PNP.\u201d\r\n\u201cNa-assign ako dito sa Police Station 4, 2006 hanggang 2012. Binigyan ako ng spot meritorious promotion ng ating Pangulo, dahil siguro sa apprehension ko ng mga most wanted na criminal dito sa Bacolod City.\u00a0Noong nakaraang Sabado, \u2018yung binigay na baril sa akin ng ating Pangulo ay nagamit ko na sa pagdakip ng isang notorious na bukas-kotse dito sa Bacolod City.\r\n\u201cNagtatrabaho tayo, kahit na mahirap, kahit na ang buhay natin ay ating itataya, para lang makapagsilbi tayo sa ating kapwa at sa bayan.\u201d\r\n\u201cNoong nasiraan ako dito sa may Quezon Avenue, bago mag-tunnel, after 15 minutes may dumating na, I think he\u2019s a policeman. Pero \u2018tong pulis na \u2018to, tinulungan talaga ako. He even tried to lift the car with his bare hands. So I was thinking na baka, eventually, humingi ng pera \u2018to. Then dumating \u2018yong wrecker, nire-wreck na \u2018yung sasakyan ko, tinotow na kaagad. Sabi ng pulis: No, tulong muna bago hatak.\r\n\u201cOut of my gratitude, binibigyan ko siya ng 1,000 kasi tinulungan niya ko. Pero di niya tinanggap. Ang sagot niya sa \u2019kin: \u2018Ang trabaho namin ay tumulong sa mamamayan\u2019.\u201d\r\n\u201cMay pagbabago na sa ating mga kapulisan. Para kay PO Sultan: I salute you.\u201d\r\n\u201cSa ngayon, \u2018yong tinatawag nating modernization program ng Navy, hindi lang naman gamit \u2018yan e. Kaakibat na rin yung para sa mga welfare sa mga tao natin. At nakikita naman namin\u2014hindi lang ako, sampu ng aking mga kasama sa \u00a0Hukbong Dagat ng Pilipinas: Natutuwa kami sa mga changes na nakikita namin. \u2018Yong tuwid na daan ng ating Pangulo, talagang nararamdaman talaga namin. Masaya kami ngayon; wala na kaming hihilingin pa. Kaya sabi ko sa mga kasama ko, ibinibigay na sa \u2019tin ng gobyerno lahat. Gawin naman natin trabaho natin, at ibalik natin para sa bayan, para sa mga tao.\u201d\r\n[\r\n]\r\nNi minsan, hindi naman nagkulang ang bansa natin ng mga taong handang manindigan at lumaban, kahit gaano pa kalaki ang mga pagsubok sa kaniyang harapan. Nariyan ang tapang na ipinamalas ni Commodore Ramon Alcaraz noong Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig. Lulan ng isang Q-Boat na yari sa kahoy, sinagupa niya ang siyam na Zero fighter ng hapon, na itinuturing noon na isa sa pinakamodernong eroplano; tatlo nito ang napabagsak niya. Ang totoo nga po, tuluy-tuloy pa rin siyang lalaban, kung hindi pa ang sarili niyang mga pinuno ang nag-atas sa kanyang sumuko. Ang kagitingang ito ang araw-araw ding ipinapamalas ng mga sundalo nating nagtatanod sa mga pinakaliblib na kabundukan, at sa pinakamalalayo nating isla; mga kawal na tinitiis ang layo sa pamilya, at taas-noong naninindigan sa sinumang sumusubok sa ating soberanya. Hindi rin po kalabisang isiping ang mga tagumpay natin sa tuwid na daan ay maaaring pangarap pa rin hanggang ngayon kung wala ang mga miyembro naman ng ating Gabinete. Nang inalok ko silang maging bahagi ng ating pamahalaan, alam nilang hindi magiging madali ang kanilang trabaho. Subalit maituturing na biyaya na tinanggap nila ang hamon, nanumpa silang tutulong sa transpormasyon, at simula\u2019t sapul, araw-araw silang nagsasakripisyo upang hindi masayang ang pribilehiyong paglingkuran kayo.\r\nMay mga katulad ni Kalihim Albert del Rosario. Kung ibabase sa tradisyon, ang unang opisyal na biyahe sa labas ng Pilipinas ng isang kalihim ay sa mga bansang may matibay at mapayapa tayong ugnayan. Ngunit pagkatapos niyang manumpa bilang Foreign Affairs Secretary, kumuha lang yata ng pambihis, lumipad agad si Secretary del Rosario patungong Libya; dumaan sa mahigit 20 checkpoint sa gitna ng putukan, at pinamunuan ang paglikas ng mahigit 20,000 Pilipino na naipit sa kaguluhan sa Libya. [\r\n] Baka po magulat kayo pag narinig ninyo kung taga-saang bansa ang mga banyagang nakiangkas pa sa ating paglilikas. Iba na nga po ang Pilipinas ngayon: Imbes na tayo lang ang parating tinutulungan, ngayon, kaya na rin nating tumulong sa mga dayuhan. [\r\n] Kung tutuusin, maaari namang tanggihan ni Secretary Albert ang pagtatrabaho sa gobyerno. Isa siyang respetado\u2019t matagumpay na negosyante, at tiyak na mas magiging komportable siya sa pribadong buhay. Dati na rin po nating siyang nakiambag bilang ambassador natin sa Amerika. Puwede naman siyang nadismaya na lang nang pababain siya sa puwesto, dahil tinutulan niya ang pagdeklara ng State of Emergency ng nakaraang administrasyon noong 2006. Pero tinawag po natin siya para bumalik, at tumugon siya. Ngayon po, nagbibigay siya ng mas malaki pang ambag bilang kalihim. Handa niyang ilagay ang sarili sa panganib, dahil alam niyang walang ibang sasaklolo sa Pilipino kundi ang kapwa rin Pilipino. Sa patuloy mong paninindigan para sa ating karapatan, saludo po ako sa inyo, Secretary Albert del Rosario. [\r\n]\r\nTranspormasyon din po ang dulot ng inspirasyong hatid ng matitinong lingkod-bayan. Nagluksa ang milyun-milyong Pilipino sa pagpanaw ni Jesse Robredo. Sa loob ng halos dalawang dekada, namuno siya nang may husay, malasakit, at pagpapakumbaba sa Naga. Ang mga prinsipyong ito nga mismo ang dahilan kung bakit hiniram natin siya mula kay Congresswoman Leni, at sa tatlo nilang mga anak, at sa mga Nague\u00f1o, upang maging bahagi ng ating Gabinete. Kaya nga po, matapos ang trahedya, isa na siguro sa pinakamahirap na tungkuling ginampanan ko ang paghahatid ng balita kina Leni at kanilang mga anak.\r\nBukod sa pagluluksa, hindi ko maiwasang sisihin ang sarili ko dahil sa sinapit ni Jesse. Baka kung hindi ko siya hinikayat mapabilang sa Gabinete, buhay pa siya ngayon. Baka kung nanatili na lamang siya sa Naga, kapiling pa natin siya. Baka may isa pa ring Jesse Robredo na naglilingkod ngayon.\r\nSubalit sa isang banda, alam kong hindi hahayaan ni Jesse na tumigil sa kanya ang pagbabago at pagtutuwid ng lipunan. Nabigyan lamang ako, at nabigyan din lamang si Jesse, ng pagkakataong maglingkod sa bansa dahil sa inyo. Hindi nag-iisa ang mukha ng pagbabago. Hindi na aabutin pa ng isandaang taon bago isilang ang susunod na mabuting tao, bago tumindig ang susunod na mabuting Pilipino.\r\nMay mga nagtatanong nga po lagi sa akin: Paano na sa 2016? Paano pag bumaba ka na? Tapos na rin ba ang tapat na pamamahala? Tapos na ba ang tuwid na daan?\r\nMga Boss, isipin nga po natin: Saan ba tayo nagmula? Kung may agam-agam kayo ngayon, ano ba naman ito kumpara sa agam-agam natin noong 2010? Di ba\u2019t masaya na tayo noon na tapos na ang panahon ng kadiliman? Di ba\u2019t noon, sapat nang mapalitan ang mga nasa kapangyarihan?\r\nNgayon, tinatamasa na natin ang pagbabago. Mula ito sa mga butil ng malasakit, ng pakikipagkapwa, ng pagkakawang-gawa; nanggaling ito sa milyun-milyong Pilipinong kahit sa pinakapayak na paraan ay nagkusang makiambag sa transpormasyon ng bansa.\r\nSa pag-aambagang ito, tingnan ninyo ang ating narating: May nakaisip bang magiging abot-kamay na ang kapayapaan sa rehiyong 40 taon nang pinupunit ng hidwaan? Di ba\u2019t gawa ito ng mga Morong handang magbaba ng armas at sinabing, \u201cHalika, mag-usap na tayo, nagtitiwala ako\u201d? Di ba\u2019t gawa ito ng karaniwang mamamayang nagsabing, \u201cKapatid, pareho tayong Pilipino, tama na nga ang gulo\u201d? [\r\n]\r\nNang unang iminungkahi ang Pantawid Pamilya, nariyan ang tanong: Paanong maaabot ang kailangan nitong epekto; nasaan ang pondo para masaklaw ang lahat ng maralitang Pilipino? May nag-akala bang, matapos lamang ang tatlong taon, aabot sa halos 4 milyong kabahayan ang nagiging benepisyaryo nito? At di ba\u2019t sila rin\u2014ang bawat inang gumigising nang maaga para ipaghanda ang anak niyang papasok sa eskuwela, ang bawat batang nag-aaral nang mabuti\u2014di ba\u2019t sila rin ang nakiambag at patuloy na nakikiambag para magtagumpay ang programang ito?\r\nMay nag-akala bang mula sa pag-aangkat ng milyun-milyong toneladang bigas, sa pagtatapos pa lang ng 2012 ay 94 percent rice self-sufficient na tayo? May nag-akala bang ang dating \u201cSick Man of Asia,\u201d sa loob lamang ng tatlong taon ng tapat na pamamahala, ay nasa investment grade status na? Sino nga po ba ang nag-isip na maipapatupad ang lahat ng serbisyong panlipunan natin ngayon, nang di nagtataas ng buwis maliban siyempre sa Sin Tax? Di ba\u2019t nakiambag dito ang bawat accountant, doktor, abugado, na ngayon ay nagbabayad ng tamang buwis? Di ba\u2019t nakiambag tayong lahat dito?\r\nMay puwang pa ba para sa mga agam-agam? Ngayon pa bang natutupad na ang mga dating ni hindi natin magawang pangarapin, ngayon pa bang nakausad na tayo, at abot-kamay na ang ating mga hangarin\u2014Boss, ngayon pa ba tayo magdududa?\r\nSa bawat Pilipinong nagtitiwala sa kapangyarihan ng maliliit na anyo ng kabutihan: Kayo nga po ang gumawa ng pagbabago. SONA po ninyo ito.\r\nSa bawat gurong bumabangon nang madaling-araw para magturo sa kanayunan: SONA mo ito.\r\nSa bawat pulis na nagsilbi at hindi nanghingi ng kapalit: SONA po n\u2019yo ito.\r\nSa mga hindi panatag sa listahan ng mga tatakbo sa halalan, at kinatok ang kapitbahay para sabihing, \u201cHuwag tayong makuntento, magtulungan tayong humanap ng karapat-dapat na pinuno,\u201d SONA mo ito.\r\nSa bawat estudyanteng mulat sa mga napapanahong isyu sa lipunan, at sa halip na magreklamo lang sa Facebook ay nagmumungkahi ng solusyon: SONA mo ito. [\r\n]\r\nKay Brigadier General Ramon Mateo Dizon, paretirong pinuno ng Presidential Security Group, na kasama ko na noon pa, laban sa mga kudeta noong panahon ng nanay ko: Hanggang sa aking pagkapangulo, pinangalagaan mo ang seguridad ko, pati na ng personal at opisyal kong pamilya. Buong kumpiyansa akong pumunta, sa ibang bansa man o sa mga liblib na sulok ng Pilipinas. Chito, nakiambag ka rin sa pagbabago; tunay kang tapat sa watawat, sa Saligang Batas, at sa sambayanang Pilipino. [\r\n] Siyempre, kung di ka inalalayan ng iyong butihing maybahay na si Jo-ann, hindi mo naabot ang iyong mga tagumpay. SONA n\u2019yong dalawa ito. [\r\n]\r\nAt sa lahat ng mga gumising sa nagtutulug-tulugan, sa mga nagmulat sa mga nagbubulag-bulagan, sa mga kumalampag sa mga nagbibingi-bingihan: SONA po ninyo ito. [\r\n]\r\nMahaba pa ang ating lalakbayin, at hindi natin kailanman sinabing madali o walang mga hadlang sa landas na ito. Subalit wala akong duda sa kakayahan nating lampasan ang anumang barikada. Hindi tsamba ang mga tagumpay na tinatamasa natin ngayon; huwag tayong papayag na maging panandalian lamang ang transpormasyon. Samantalahin natin ang pagkakataon upang gawing permanente ang pagbabago.\r\nIto po ang aking ikaapat na SONA. Noong ako\u2019y Congressman, ang mga taga-Tarlac ang aking lakas; nang ako\u2019y maging Senador, at hanggang ngayon, sa aking pagkapangulo, nariyan ang sambayanan\u2014Pilipinas, kayo ang aking lakas. [\r\n] Sa patuloy nating pag-aambagan at pananalig sa kapwa at sa Maykapal, sinasabi ko po sa inyo: Kayo pa rin ang sisigurong magpapatuloy ang ating nasimulan; kayo ang sisigurong mabubura na nang tuluyan ang mukha ng katiwalian; kayo ang sisigurong hinding-hindi na tayo muling lilihis sa tuwid na daan.\r\nSinabi po sa akin dati: Noynoy, simulan mo lang, at sinimulan nga po natin, at ngayon, kitang-kita na ang layo ng ating narating. Ngayon, Pilipino, ituloy natin ang pagkakapit-bisig, sabay nating arugain, pabilisin, at palawakin ang transpormasyon ng lipunan. Ako po si Noynoy Aquino; ipinagmamalaki ko sa buong mundo: Pilipino ako. At talagang napakasarap maging Pilipino sa panahong ito.\r\nMaraming salamat po. Magandang hapon po sa lahat.

Congratulations to the Filipino people. [\r\n]\r\nSamakatuwid, ipabatid sa lahat, mula sa pook at panahong ito, sa bawat Pilipino, saan man naroroon\u2026\r\nYou have a government\u2014indeed, you have a country\u2014that cares. Your life is held more dearly than international acclaim. [\r\n] And you have a President who is your friend. [\r\n]\r\nWhy was Angelo de la Cruz saved? Because I stuck to my oath. Since I first became President in 2001, my declared foreign policy focus has been to protect the vital interests of the nation, including our 8 million overseas Filipinos.\r\nAnd I cannot apologize for being a protector of my people. [\r\n]\r\nThe difference of a few weeks, for a pullout already decided on, could not justify sacrifice of a human life.\r\nSacrificing Angelo de la Cruz would have been a pointless provocation; it would have put the lives of a million and a half Filipinos in the Middle East at risk, by making them part of the war.\r\nWars are for combatants. As I speak soldiers are being held hostage by communist insurgents, but they don\u2019t expect to be released except by the compassion of their captors or a military operation.\r\nWe have been fighting the longest-running communist insurgency in history. We have been coming to grips with fundamentalist terrorism long before 9/11.\r\nAs the leader of the nation, I say in behalf of the Filipino people to the world: We are strong and principled believers in democracy. Four generations of fighting Filipinos have ceaselessly struggled against totalitarians and terrorists for our freedom, for the freedom of our people and the people of the world.\r\nWe have fought the enemy, and taken as good as we gave\u2014not from a safe distance but in close quarters. Bataan and Corregidor, Korea and Vietnam, East Timor, Kosovo, Liberia, to name a few.\r\nWhen I opted to save Angelo de la Cruz, I was reflecting whether one life should be sacrificed for no pressing reason or saved by accelerating an ongoing pullout.\r\nI did not sacrifice policy to save a human life. I applied policy for that purpose. [\r\n] The Philippines has no policy that demands sacrifice of human lives.\r\nAsk yourselves this: If Angelo de la Cruz had been sacrificed, what would change for the better in Iraq today?\r\nHaving saved one Filipino from a painful and pointless death, we must seize the unity we attained to improve our government and save our economy. [\r\n]\r\nPinapangako ko ang isang bagong direksyon: mamamayan muna. Ang taong bayan ang pinakamalaki nating yaman. Ngunit madalas, kaunti lang ang atensyon na binibigay sa kanilang pag-unlad. Di tuloy matawid ang agwat ng mayaman at mahirap. Di tuloy mapa-abot sa lahat ang biyaya ng demokrasya.\r\nI want to create economic opportunity at home and abroad. I don\u2019t want just one or the other. I want both.\r\nBut it can only be done with focus, with energy, and with a common purpose to do that which still lies within our power: put our economic house back in working order [\r\n] before it finds itself beyond hope of repair and doomed to share the fate of failed nations.\r\nWe made a head start in the last three years; we must take bolder steps forward in the next six.\r\nInflation is under control. The ordinary housewife has been buying her rice and fish at stable prices.\r\nNew investments, foreign and, better yet, domestic, were made. Three million more of our people found jobs in the last three years compared to half a million in the three years before that.\r\nMalaki ang pag-unlad sa pangunahing pangangailangan\u2014malinis na tubig, health insurance, tirahan, paaralan, aklat.\r\nWe beat down crime, we are breaking up the drug and kidnapping syndicates, we are mopping up the stragglers. The people are safer in the streets, in their homes, and in their places of work.\r\nEvery government in the world is at war with its own corruption; we have made lifestyle checks a lethal weapon, and adopted procurement reforms to take the fight forward.\r\nThanks to many of you, I emerged from the last election with more votes than any previous president. [\r\n]\r\nAs a further sign of the people\u2019s overwhelming support, they gave me a huge majority in Congress, and and a huge majority among the local governments.\r\nThis is a new day, with a new direction, and a renewed confidence in what we can achieve together.\r\nI am determined to prove that this tremendous show of faith and confidence is well deserved.\r\nThe season of bitter partisanship is over; the season of service is upon us all\u2014majority, minority, opposition, administration.\r\nIn my inaugural address, I laid down a 10-point agenda for the next six years\u2014not utopia but something practical we can achieve and accomplish on time.\r\nWhat I did promise was that my term would be the irreversible turning point.\r\nIpinangangako ko\u2014iiwanan na natin ang ligalig at alinlangan.\r\nAt the end of my term, the question will not longer be whether we can compete but where else in the world shall we take an indisputable competitive advantage.\r\nThe next six years, we hope, is when we finally get things right.\r\nIs there something about that goal we cannot all agree on? Is there a reason we cannot all work together?\r\nAll that\u2019s needed is to clear away a couple of obstacles, as I intend to do with five key reform packages: (1) job creation through economic growth; (2) anticorruption through good government; (3) social justice and basic needs; (4) education and youth opportunity; and (5) energy independence and savings.\r\nTough decisions will have to be made. It\u2019s going to be tough love from hereon. It must be tougher on those who\u2019ve had it easy than on those who\u2019ve had it tough already.\r\nHumarap din sa problema ang mga karatig bansa.\r\nAng kanilang sikreto\u2019y pagkakaisa ng mamamayan, suporta sa liderato, at sakripisyo ng bawat isa.\r\nWe must bear the pain and share the pain to enjoy the gain together.\r\nThose with more must sacrifice more; those with less are already living lives of self-sacrifice.\r\nMaraming magsasabi: matagal na silang nagsasakripisyo. Ngunit hinihingi ko sa inyo: konti pang sakripisyo.\r\nWe must wait with patience for the reforms to work. In the meantime, we must work more productively because world competition is keen and we want the jobs not only to come, but to stay.\r\nOur most urgent problem is the budget deficit. Sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable; but chronic deficits are always bad.\r\nSometimes stamping out deficits too vigorously can slow down growth. But ignoring them can kill the economy. It sends the wrong signal that we don\u2019t understand our fiscal predicament and will not help ourselves. This will drive away investments, exacerbate the deficit, and hurt job growth.\r\nChronic deficits drastically reduce government\u2019s ability to make those infrastructure investments that business needs to grow and create jobs.\r\nChronic deficits mean undertaking less social services that private charity will never provide but without which social war is inevitable. This is a surefire formula for national failure.\r\nSo, we must raise revenues, expand government services, yet cut costs\u2014all at the same time. It boils down to right priorities.\r\nThe beauty of the fiscal problem is that all the solutions are known, though applying the right ones is tricky.\r\nAll the solutions require: toughness on the part of government, cooperation on the part of business, patience on the part of our people, and active support on the part of Congress.\r\nAll the solutions require profound, even personal, changes. Politicians will need to focus on the job at hand rather than on their prospect of re-election.\r\nThe worst offender yet the hardest to pin down is corporate corruption. Businessmen must adopt an attitude of tax acceptance not tax avoidance. They must stop trying to outrun the tax collector. They must recognize that only a fiscally stronger government can create a more congenial business environment: [\r\n] greater security, better infrastructure, cheaper credit, more business.\r\nMy administration will undertake reforms to raise or save P100 billion. [\r\n] I ask Congress to pass eight revenue measures that will collect P80 billion more.\r\nAlam kong maaasahan ko ang mga mambabatas upang burahin ang deficit, upang ituloy ang magandang trabaho, at upang itaguyod ang saligan ng matapat na gobyerno at malakas na ekonomiya.\r\nInvestments in infrastructure and energy provide the greatest multiplier effect for growth and job creation. \u2018Pag maganda ang imprastraktura gaya ng kalsada, tulay, pantalan, telepono, kuryente, maraming mamumuhunan. Maraming magkakaroon ng trabaho.\r\nWe must achieve sufficient, efficient, cheap energy in the near term. We must be sure to have the capacity to meet the demands of a growing economy, so as not to choke off growth when it comes, and thereby lose the opportunities that may not come again.\r\nTo this end, NAPOCOR power-generating plants and transmission lines must be privatized but not in a fire sale. [\r\n] Delivering electricity to virtually an entire country as big as ours cannot possibly be worth nothing but the trouble of running it.\r\nNAPOCOR\u2019s transmission systems will be sold on terms that recognize the lucrative monopoly of its transmission grid. I ask Congress to pass the Transco bill that already passed the House in the 12th Congress. [\r\n]\r\nOur investments in social justice and basic needs are as vital to our future as fiscal and macroeconomic reforms. A nation deeply divided will not stand. And it certainly will not move forward.\r\nOur nation is divided by social and economic faultlines. The tectonic plates may shift with unthinkable consequences.\r\nSome say that is it cheaper to die than to get well from an illness, that it is impossible to find clean water in this rainfall country, that in this modern day and age, part of the country still sits in darkness. This is a terrible waste and a terrible shame.\r\nKaya ang aking agenda para sa maralita ay hanapbuhay; reporma sa lupa; tubig, gamot, at kuryente; pagtatanggol at kapangyarihan para sa mahina.\r\nIn fact, we will now be able to bring clean water to the entire country because during my previous term, you, Congress finally passed the Clean Water Act; because in my first days as president in 2001 I signed the Solid Waste Act\u2014thank you also for giving me that opportunity\u2014and because we are reforesting our watersheds.\r\nThe place to start now is livelihood, for 10 million Filipinos.\r\nThe growing industrial, service, and microenterprise sectors will take care of some, a thriving agribusiness sector will keep more in the countryside rather than burdening a Metro Manila that is already cracking under the weight of overpopulation.\r\nLand reform covers agrarian reform, urban land reform, and ancestral domain land reform. I ask Congress to qualify farmland as bank collateral and reform the system of urban land titles.\r\nAng kapangyarihan ng taong bayan ay puso ng demokrasya. Dapat kasama sila sa paghugis ng kanilang kapalaran.\r\nDadalhin ko ang aking mga reporma sa taong bayan. Ako\u2019y magpapaliwanag, ako\u2019y makikinig.\r\nI have shown that government does care even for a single Filipino life. Now we must show that we care for the rest of the Filipino people, especially the weakest among us. [\r\n]\r\nTo adapt the words of Adam Smith to the information age, \u201cThe greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor seems to have been the effects of a modern education.\u201d\r\nEconomies have exhausted the possibilities of the division of labor; the way further forward now is a better-educated, more adaptable workforce.\r\nWe need to start early. And we need to maintain the highest educational standards. I ask Congress to legislate an extra year of studies not by adding a fifth year of high school but by standardizing what is taught in the barangay day care centers. [\r\n]\r\nTo expand youth opportunity, we need to focus on technical and vocational education; on strengthening English, Science and Technology, and love of country. [\r\n] As I said in my inaugural: It is not free markets but patriotism that makes countries strong. [\r\n]\r\nThere is a sense in which as a society we have failed the youth in their formative years, in growing up normally and productively, in getting a good education, in learning the habits of honesty and citizenship and civic discipline.\r\nI ask the educational system, the parents, the church, and pillars of the community to help shape a new culture of honesty, patriotism, respect, discipline, and service for young Filipinos. [\r\n]\r\nThe roof cannot collapse when the value pillars of government and society are sound and strong.\r\nI fervently support the judicial reforms being carried out by our Supreme Court. [\r\n]\r\nI ask Congress for a law making the ombudsman\u2019s function as effective as Hong Kong\u2019s independent commission against corruption. [\r\n]\r\nBureaucratic corruption with its numerous leakages is bad. So is government incompetence. Unlike in the private sector, where the free market punishes mistakes, government incompetence punishes only the public.\r\nWe have to tear away layers of inefficiency piled on by decades of political accommodation: redundancy in the national service, waste in local governments, and pointless procedures for getting done what isn\u2019t needed anyway to secure the public welfare. Just how does paying off the health inspector banish bacteria from a dirty kitchen? [\r\n]\r\nBy definition, public services are what the private sector will not do except for a price the public cannot pay.\r\nWhere the private sector can do it better and cheaper, government may have to step aside. [\r\n] But the watchwords are better and cheaper. Where privatization only spells public pillage, government will continue to do the work. [\r\n]\r\nBut that\u2019s no reason to spare public services from the test of competitive performance.\r\nWe will simplify procedures to eliminate fixers.\r\nWe will downsize the government, motivate excess employees to become entrepreneurs, and increase the pay of a lean and mean bureaucracy. [\r\n]\r\nI have abolished 80 offices under the Office of the President. I will abolish 30 more.\r\nI ask Congress to pass a law on government reengineering, with silver parachutes for redundant offices.\r\nOnce we have proved to our people that we have done what we can within the present structure of government, we can move on to changing the system to one that enhances our freedom and flexibility to do more.\r\nI expect that next year, Congress will start considering the resolutions for charter change. [\r\n]\r\nNo one has a monopoly on right ideas. I am reaching out to all segments of society and all parties, be they with me or against me, to join me in those things that should be everyone\u2019s concern because they rise above politics to the level of patriotism. [\r\n]\r\nI do not want a honeymoon period after which we can forget the country and go after each other again. I want a marriage not of convenience but of conviction, across the spectrum of parties and groups, encompassing the range of intelligent political, religious, and economic views. [\r\n] I want a marriage for at least the life of this Congress. [\r\n]\r\nI do not ask for unprincipled support because it will not hold.\r\nI do ask for an end to unprincipled obstructionism because that always succeeds in defeating our best efforts. [\r\n]\r\nTunay nga na kahirapan at kawalan ng katarungan ang sagabal sa ating pag-unlad. Ngunit ang mga nagsusulsol sa mahihirap para manggulo ang sumisira sa ating kinabukasan. [\r\n]\r\nSo this must stop.\r\nWe must put a stop to that.\r\nEvery year, every President tells Congress that it is the last chance for meaningful change.\r\nThis time I will say it again, adding only that past presidents were right. And that each time change doesn\u2019t happen, makes change harder and less likely to happen the next time around.\r\nThe time for change is well past due.\r\nThis time, let me say, let\u2019s just do it!\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipino!\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat. [\r\n] [\r\n]\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipino! Mabuhay!", "title": "Fourth State of the Nation Address"},
{"delivered": "1949-01-24 01:35:12+00:00", "author": "State-of-the-Nation Message of President Quirino to the Joint Session of the Congress of the Philippines", "text": "[Delivered on January 24, 1949]\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, Mr. SPEAKER,\u00a0GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nI am happy indeed to meet you in this historic hall. Its rehabilitation is the most recent evidence of our efforts at rapid reconstruction. We agreed to reconstruct the Legislative Building and the Finance and Agriculture buildings yonder only last September.\r\nToday is our homecoming to this hall. It is my hope that before long the ruins and scars of battle in this hallowed area will disappear.\r\nI have had the pleasant experience of working with you during your last legislative session. But I have not had as yet the formal occasion to thank you all for the splendid cooperation you have been giving me from the initial months of my administration. Without that cooperation I could not have carried on. I am in hopes that during the sessions just starting, we shall continue to work together with understanding and devotion, to the end that we may go ahead with the task of nation-building without unnecessary interruptions and distractions. This is an election year. We have barely ten months before most of us will have to account for our acts to the people. We have to present a work well done.\r\nAs you already know, I ascended the Presidency under the most depressing and distressing circumstances. But deep in my heart I was determined to carry on silently the work so auspiciously begun by my illustrious predecessor, our dear friend the late President Roxas, on our common venture to lay the foundations of this new Republic.\r\nMy first concern was to complete the restoration of peace and order and to strengthen our people\u2019s morale and confidence in the government. My first act in this direction was to order the reduction in the price of Class E rice, then selling at one peso, to eighty-five centavos a ganta. This order reduced the cost not only of other grades of rice but also of other essential commodities whose price structure is dependent on the cost of rice.\r\nThen I made the first of my visits to the troubled areas in Central Luzon. Here the dissident elements were terrorizing the population with kidnappings and depredations. They were preying for food and other necessities upon the poor people of Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac, the very people whose interests they were pretending to protect, whose welfare they were professing to promote. That tour elicited the offer of cooperation from the leader of the dissident elements. It resulted eventually, with your concurrence, in the issuance of an Amnesty Proclamation.\r\nDuring the period of the Amnesty, the people of Central Luzon, .especially those seeking shelter in the\r\nand those hiding in the hills, found it safe once more to return to their homes and resume the cultivation of their farms. No less than six thousand one hundred hectares in the troubled areas that had lain idle for four or five years were planted to rice. Upon the expiration of the proclamation period, the misguided elements resumed their defiance of the gov\u00adernment. They began again to harass the people dur\u00ading harvest time. But the government, through an effective Constabulary campaign, has been able not only to break their organization, driving the remnants to the deep recesses of the Sierra Madre, but to secure the biggest rice harvest since the outbreak of the war despite a drought and other natural calamities.\r\nThe Amnesty also served to unmask the dissidents. It exposed their communistic inspiration and direction. It uncovered their real purpose to overthrow the gov\u00adernment, which they had cloaked by agitation for so-\u00adcalled social and agrarian reforms. Realizing this as they never had before, our law-abiding citizens gave\u00b7\u2019 the government all their loyalty and support in the subsequent policy it followed of going after the dissi\u00addents with all its strength and power to uphold the law.\r\nI am glad to report to you that the sporadic depre\u00addations of these outlaws in isolated areas of the country are but the last paroxysms of, a dying movement.\r\nWith the recent surrender of two hundred Moro out\u00adlaws in Jolo, the only threat of disorder in the traditional trouble area in the Sulu Archipelago during many regimes, has also disappeared.\r\nThe government shall continue its vigilance against potential disruptive elements which impair the efficiency of our productive efforts. We will not tolerate further interference with the steady prosecution of our social and economic program.\r\nMy second immediate objective was to provide for relief to the people in the troubled areas.\r\nBy executive order I created the Action Committee on Social Amelioration. I charged it with the duty to go to the field and minister to the needy, the hungry, the homeless and the sick, to victims of dissident, depredations and violence. I placed the four million pesos appropriated by Congress for peace and order and relief at the disposal of the Committee.\r\nThe Action Committee has carried out a program of social amelioration on a systematic and comprehensive scale. Some 700,000 needy people in thirteen provinces and chartered cities secured direct assistance food, clothing, medicine and, in some cases, direct cash loans. These loans amounted to P205,000 and were given to tenant-farmers in Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Rizal, Laguna and Quezon. In addition, the Committee distributed P330,000 worth of seeds, mainly palay, for distribution to farmers to augment the production of rice. Other food crops have likewise been planted. To provide employment to long unemployed people, the construction of public works projects in the troubled area was speeded up. In order to encourage the establishment of homes for the land\u00adless, the acquisition of big landed estates to be parceled for resale to\r\ntenants at cost was also accelerated. Besides the purchase of thirty-five\r\ncomprising 161.3 million square meters valued at 13.3 million pesos, we are acquiring additional estates in Arayat and Sta. Ana, Pampanga, and in Jalajala, Rizal, for the same purpose. These proposed new acquisitions involve an area of about 49.3 million square meters valued approximately at 1.2 million pesos.\r\nThe social amelioration program has been extended to other portions of the archipelago as far as Mindanao and Sulu, and has become a major policy of the Ad\u00administration.\r\nBy the approval of Republic Act No. 304, we have solved the long standing demand among our thousands of government employees for backpay, under conditions which will do justice to the beneficiaries without unduly straining the finances of our government. By Acts Nos. 312 and 315, we have increased the minimum salaries of teachers, enlisted men and other small government employees. We have also elevated the status of the nurses in the Army by the creation under Act No. 203 of the Nurses Corps in the Medical Service.\r\nRepublic Act No. 312 provides for the standardization of teachers\u2019 salaries on the basis of occupational assign\u00adments and educational qualifications. The 1948-1949 Appropriation Act had already been passed when this law was enacted. It will be my concern to make adequate provision in our next budget in order to carry out within our financial capacity the standardized rates provided for by this law.\r\nWe have further improved the lot of temporary gov\u00adernment employees and workers, including those in the corporations owned or controlled by the government, regardless of status, by giving them fifteen days vacation leave and fifteen days sick leave with full pay each year.\r\nThis past year additional relief accrued to our people from a substantial increase in employment. Wages increased two per cent, while the cost of living, based on the price index of essential commodities, dropped 39 per cent, a most gratifying development. Verily, the rising level of earning and the decreasing cost of living are converging upon a point of economic stability favorable to the great masses of our people.\r\nWe have obtained from the United States Govern\u00adment provision for the hospitalization of our veterans. Our government has extended to our heroes of the war and the resistance such benefits as we have been able initially to afford. At our invitation, a mission of the United States Veterans Administration will arrive in \u00adManila next month to look further into the possibility of improving the assistance that has been given to Filipino veterans.\r\nWe have warded off epidemics. Large-scaIe immu\u00adnization work has been accomplished. Medical care and facilities have been extended. Traveling clinics have been established. Hospitals and puericulture centers have been rehabilitated. We are taking steps to introduce on a big scale in our country the latest ad\u00advances in medical science including new drugs and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of leprosy and tuberculosis.\r\nWe have solved the heretofore recurrent school crisis. Nine thousand additional classes were opened throughout the country. We have made possible the admission of every child of school age seeking entrance to our public schools. For the first time in the history of civil administration in this country there was no such thing as a school crisis this school year.\r\nTo minimize delay in the adjudication of cases, we have expanded our judiciary by increasing the number of judges. We now have a full complement of the Judiciary, which has been completely reorganized under the Judiciary Act of 1948.\r\nWe have taken a new census of the country. After the long and destructive war, it was necessary to assess our resources for recovery and to plan for continued growth. The report shows our total population to be over 19 million as of October first, last. It indicates that have sufficient manpower to carry out our program national development.\r\nThe Administration is attaching particular importance to the adequacy of the coverage and the quality of the results produced by that census. We hope that it will give us a correct basis from which to draw a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the manpower resources of our country.\r\nWe must provide at the earliest practicable time facilities for efficient utilization of these resources. We need a more diversified occupational pattern, a reduction in the volume and duration of unemployment, an increase in the worker\u2019s share in a bigger national output. We must insure those social welfare benefits so necessary to the attainment of full stature of a self-respecting citizen-education, recreation, security against illness and the infirmities of old age.\r\nDuring the last twelve months, we have rehabilitated 25,260 kilometers of roads, built 663 kilometers of new roads, constructed or rehabilitated 605 school houses, erected or rehabilitated 381 public buildings, con\u00adstructed or repaired 2,241 temporary and six permanent bridges, built or rehabilitated irrigation systems, at a total cost of 68.8 million pesos. This sum came from our general appropriations, from funds obtained from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, and from the Philippine War Damage Commission.\r\nWe have balanced our national budget. We shall again have at the end of the current fiscal year a size\u00adable surplus. But it is important that we continue with vigor our efforts to increase the revenue collections and to limit expenses to the most essential needs of the\u00b7 public service.\r\nWe have greatly improved the economic and financial conditions of the country. Through the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, loans amounting to P90,480,136 have been granted for reconstruction and rehabilitation purposes. These loans have gone to farmers, tenants, industrialists, builders of homes and other elements assisting in the general economic uplift.\r\nWe have set up the Central Bank to expand our credit, stabilize our currency and provide a new source of financing for the agricultural and industrial develop\u00adment of the nation.\r\nWith the operation of the Central Bank, we expect to maintain our domestic monetary stability, the inter\u00adnational value of the peso, the free convertibility of \u00adthe peso into United States dollars and other freely con\u00advertible currencies, and the promotion of a rising level of production, employment and real income. The greatest service of the Bank to the growth and prosperity of the national economy will lie in its use of its prerogatives under the law to create that financial en\u00advironment in which the growth of sound productive enterprises and the creation of a diversified pattern of production will be greatly encouraged. It is an obliga\u00adtion of the Bank to promote and increase the rate of savings and channel them into productive investment outlets.\r\nWe have taken a long step forward in the financing of our industrial development. We have successfully concluded negotiations with the International Bank for. Reconstruction and Development for a loan covering our dollar needs in the construction of two of the four hydro-electric water power projects intended to spark our industrialization program. A definite commitment by the Bank in the sum of fifteen million dollars has been made. But hat amount will be adequate only for the Ambuklao and Lumot projects. Further negotiations will be conducted for the financing of the Itogon and the Maria Cristina projects, particularly the latter. The intensification of the agricultural and industrial development of Mindanao occupies a top priority in our program. The commitment thus far made is not only a favorable sign ushering in finally the implementation of our plans of economic development, but a significantly successful test of the solvency of our foreign credit, for it was accepted only after a thorough examination of our resources and development plans by a board of economists of international authority.\r\nWe have effected export control to retain for our own use articles and materials in short supply here, and import control to conserve our dollar resources so nec\u00adessary for the expansion of our own productive enterprises.\r\nIf in the process greater participation by our own countrymen in the import trade is fostered, a greater gain will have been achieved. The import control order is not a finality. If it be found that supplies limited by the order will not adequately meet legitimate and justifiable demand the satisfaction of which will serve the national interest, increased quotas will be author\u00adized. But the fundamental objective of conserving the foreign exchange resources so that they may be available for economic development and of giving impetus to domestic production will loom large in the consideration of questions involving the relaxation of these controls. Our means and our remedies will be productive rather than speculative or merely restrictive.\r\nWe have yet to expand our foreign markets and cul\u00adtivate and stabilize them with the continuous flow of exportable products in improved and standardized form.\r\nWith special pride I call your attention to the fact that today the Philippines has the friendship and respect of all nations. Our international relations have become stronger. Although the United States continues to be the only country that maintains an embassy here, eight other countries now have legations, and twenty-four nations in all have set up eight consulates general, fourteen consulates and four consular agencies. For our part, we have diplomatic establishments\u2019 in eight nations and consular representatives in seventeen cities. We have recently established Philippine legations in London, Rome, Madrid, Nanking, Buenos Aires and a special mission in Tokyo. Our participations in inter\u00adnational conferences, especially in the United Nations and. its various agencies, and in interparliamentary unions and scientific and cultural conventions, have been conspicuous with constructive contributions to world understanding and peace.\r\nThe bi-partisan policy in foreign affairs which we adopted at the beginning of our international life as a Republic has resulted in effective representation abroad and virtually unanimous support at home. Our delegates have been honored with appointments to posi\u00adtions of leadership in many international conferences in which we have participated. The nations have shown an increasing respect for the integrity and wis\u00addom of our counsel.\r\nOur special relationship with the United States has been productive of goodwill invaluable to our growth as a young nation. We have shared in the rejoicing of the people of the United States in the re-election of President Truman and in the return of a Congress sym\u00adpathetic to his liberal program. It. was President Truman who proclaimed the independence of the Phil\u00adippines barely two years ago. His continuance as the head of that great nation insures an abiding American concern over the future of our young Republic.\r\nWith the entire East threatened by the onrushing tide of Communism, the Philippines, the most strategic cross\u00adroads linking the West and the East, remains the one safe, attractive home for free men in our part of the world, a haven for the masses of humanity fleeing from that flood.\r\nI have reorganized the Cabinet. New members with proven ability, experience and integrity have been appointed. I have elevated the lady Commissioner of Social Welfare to Cabinet rank, giving to that position the importance commensurate with the new tasks assigned to it of carrying out the policy of the government on social amelioration. I have advanced in both the judicial and the executive departments, men of high standard of efficiency, thus giving encouragement to those in the lower ranks who have shown merit and loyalty to the service. I have opened opportunities for younger men to prepare themselves for high responsibilities in the public service. I am determined to pursue a line of action that will insure to our people honest and efficient service and will provide full enjoyment of the liberty and equal opportunity that we have dearly fought for and won, in peace and in war, at home and abroad.\r\nWe have laid the foundations of a stable, efficient, honored and dignified government. And we have brought it nearer to our people. We have been taking every opportunity to talk directly to them in their cities and towns, to observe their manner of living, to hear them discuss their needs, express their criticisms, their hopes, their aspirations.\r\nWe have strengthened further their confidence in our sincerity and integrity. We have demonstrated our willingness to invite and face public scrutiny. We have eliminated whatever evils have been uncovered. We have proved the primacy of public interest over party, group or personal claims. More than as the supreme head of the Liberal Party, in accordance with whose rules I am \u201cthe authorized spokesman of its decisions and policies,\u201d as President of the Republic I declare this to be the unequivocal policy and determination of the Administration.\r\nI cannot believe that God will not allow us to maintain this kind of government. We must consecrate ourselves and all our efforts to its attainment and dare while we pray, and pray while we dare.\r\nLet me turn now to the immediate tasks before us.\r\nThe most important and urgent aim of this administration at this stage is increased production and social amelioration. We cannot indefinitely ride on the foam of foreign charity and friendship. We must produce our own immediate necessities and raise, by the sweat of our brow, the lot of the men who toil on the farms and in the factories. We shall, where necessary, effect changes in the national economy to achieve this end. Our responsibility is no less urgent to those displaced and rendered homeless by public calamities.\r\nSocial security measures are under preparation by the Social Security Study Commission which I created for the purpose. The complexity and far-reaching consequences to our social life of such measures call for the closest study of their provisions. I urge you to approve adequate legislation providing for more health and housing facilities to banish our urban slums, to eliminate those fire hazards that are a daily menace to life and health, especially among the poorer sections of our towns and cities. We need more practical measures to implement our objective of giving our citizenry the maximum benefits to be derived from the development of our agricultural and industrial potentialities.\r\nThis is the age of the common man. This government has long stopped preaching. It now goes out to the field with an Action Committee and with a sizeable fund for its use in order to improve the lot of the com\u00admon man. The activities of the Committee are only in their initial stage. We want to follow up the program of social amelioration with greater intensity and give the masses a Straight Deal. This is my all-absorbing and consuming passion. We have to insure a standard of living in the farms, in the factories, in the homes that will be more in keeping and commensurate with our progress and advancement.\r\nThe pensions to war widows, orphans and disabled veterans must continue with adequate funds therefore. The nation owes an eternal debt of gratitude to them. Their sacrifices shall not be in vain. I beseech the Congress to give the matter immediate consideration.\r\nThe redemption of emergency currency and guerrilla notes is a legal and moral obligation of this Government.\r\nOur people are not concerned whether the funds for the purpose come from our Government or from the United States. The amount of 30 million pesos earmarked for the purpose and an additional ten million pesos made available by our government are insufficient to cover at par the full amount of P112,951,907 found by the Emergency Currency Board as having been duly issued .\r\nIt is necessary that we evolve a redemption scheme, an equitable solution. But a quick solution is imperative.\r\nThere has been a notable readiness on the part of our laboring class to cooperate in the constructive activities of the country. The minimum wage for our laborers must be standardized and stabilized. I have urged the Labor-Management Advisory Board, in which capital and labor are equally represented, to submit a schedule it of wages applicable in the different industries and localities.\r\nThe Labor-Management Advisory Board is now studying the problem of wage standards in different regions. We must forestall wasteful periodic demands for revision of wages and the consequent uneconomic stoppages in our machinery of production. We need regulative rather than prohibitive measures against strikes. Both labor and capital must cooperate to achieve this end.\r\nThe salaries of employees in the lower brackets must also be improved. Private enterprises are offering better opportunities, and the Government is beginning to lose its most experienced personnel in the competition.\r\nThe outlook for tuberculosis control in our country by the use of the vaccine called \u201cBacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is giving us high hopes; It is opening a new horizon to the work of reducing tuberculosis incidence to the minimum. Our authorities are keeping abreast of latest developments in medical research in other countries. We are a member of the World Health Organization through which the most recent medical discoveries and techniques are being made available to our people. While we should be discriminating in the adoption or application of remedies recently discovered, we should not lose time to utilize them to relieve our people once their efficacy is proven.\r\nIn the construction of roads I recommend that we provide sufficient funds to facilitate the building of cement or asphalt roads not only for reasons of economy but also for the health of our people. Our dusty roads are the causes of so many ailments afflicting them, especially tuberculosis.\r\nIn view of the lack of physicians in many of our com\u00admunities, I recommend the immediate study and ap\u00adproval of legislation providing for pre-paid medical service to our population which cannot afford medical assistance, especially those in remote rural communities.\r\nOur educational policy must be reviewed and revised for closer coordination with the objectives of our pro\u00adposed development program, without sacrificing the tra\u00additional aim of providing a liberal culture basic to the good life. I hope that the Joint Educational Committee of the Congress engaged in this study will be able to evolve a revision of the school system more adaptable to and in keeping with our national requirements.\r\nI urge total economic mobilization. Our economic structure should be built from below, making the foun\u00addation firm and accessible to the general population so that everyone can contribute to and share in the benefits of our material progress.\r\nWe must increase on the one hand our receipts from exports of improving quality, and decrease on the other the amounts of our import bills. The display and sale \u00adof Philippine-made goods must be given emphasis to balance the entrenched position of imported articles. We must not only produce more, but must educate our people to consume more home products. National protectionism in this regard is a legitimate ambition of every self-respecting independent nation.\r\nThe achievement of the first objective of increased production for export requires improvement of the cost conditions of our existing export industries, the develop\u00adment of new export products, the creation and cultiva\u00adtion of new markets for our export trade.\r\nWe have heretofore overlooked or neglected our im\u00admediate neighbors in orienting our economic ties abroad.\r\nOur search for new markets and the intensification of our promotional activities should consider the hitherto closed areas of Latin America, Europe and the Near East.\r\nTo achieve the second objective, we must give priority to the development of economic projects which can be brought up to the producing point within a relatively short time and will enable us to reduce the amount of dollars spent on imports.\r\nNow is our opportunity to initiate the adjustment of our economy to maintain a stable, high level of em\u00adployment without unduly exposing our program to the\u2019 dangers of unpredictable violent fluctuations of demand for basic export crops in the foreign markets.\r\nI shall urge the members of the National Economic Council to give priority consideration to the Government\u2019s short term development program. It should serve as the coordinating authority to knit together into a harmonious whole, bank credit policy, government, credit and fiscal policy, and developmental investment policy. The Council will be clothed with authority to approve and schedule projects, to allocate on a fair basis the funds or credit which the Central Bank may from time to time mobilize to the loan portfolios of government lending agencies, to keep them within the approved pattern of allocation of available capital and the limitations established by law. We will draw upon our full credit capacity, backed by the guaranty of the Na\u00adtional Government, to secure funds for this program.\r\nThere is need for coordination of the policies and operation of our government corporations to increase their usefulness to the national economy. It may be necessary to\u2019 re-examine their structure and organiza\u00adtion, their policies and their objectives, the scope and nature of their activities, and to gear all these to new goals set by a coherent development program. I recommend serious consideration of the advisability of creating a national central body or department that can more effectively direct, supervise and control the operations of government corporations. The coordination and consolidation of these corporations under one directing authority will place under unified direction assets worth over one billion pesos and corporate net worth valued at over 300 million pesos.\r\nIn our economic mobilization, we should give priority to our already established major industries. The abaca industry needs replanting and expansion. The tobacco industry must be revived and its foreign markets re\u00adopened. The industrial processes developed for the coconut industry must be fully exploited. The pre\u00adwar sugar industry must be restored and markets for excess production over domestic demand and the United States import quota limitations must be found. I created the Sugar Rehabilitation and Readjustment Commission to advise the government on the proper measures to be adopted to revitalize and stabilize the sugar industry. In due time I will submit measures to realize these objectives.\r\nIt is necessary that we cast our eyes and exhaust our resourcefulness to secure the fuller utilization of our other natural resources and possibilities. We must speed up the digging of our mines, hasten the exploitation of our water power, and stimulate the search for new uses of our varied agricultural products heretofore not efficiently or commercially utilized.\r\nAGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT\r\nThe main problem of the country today is still to find ways and means of increasing production not only of palay and corn which constitute the basic cereal foods of the Filipino people, but also of other food crops, as well as meat, milk and other livestock prod\u00aducts, fish and other foodstuffs. More as a temporary solution of the worst rice crisis since liberation, I created the Rice Emergency Board which controls the procure\u00adment and distribution of locally-produced rice now and for the next two years. I fixed the price of this com\u00admodity for the two-year period on an attractive basis for the direct benefit of the producers in order to encourage the production and steady supply of the cereal. Let us conduct a campaign for increased production, at least one more cavan of rice or corn per hectare of the\u2019 thousands we are now cultivating. The plans are ad\u00advanced for the setting up of a fertilizer plant to encourage larger agricultural production. I recommend that more appropriations be set aside for the construction of new irrigation systems and the repair of those already in existence.\r\nIn the face of a persistent world shortage of rice\u201d production, the Philippines cannot and should not be content to remain a rice importing nation. We are adopting measures to increase domestic production as rapidly as possible and help, incidentally, to conserve our foreign exchange resources. Independently of other recommendations of the Rice Emergency Commission, I have instructed the National Development Company to develop two 10,000-hectare areas for rice and peanut production: one in Cotabato and the other in Mindoro. Work in Cotabato is under way. Sixteen hundred hectares are now under cultivation. In fact we have a handsome initial harvest of 130,000 pesos worth of peanuts this season. This is but the beginning of the developmental work in agriculture planned in Mindanao. Similar preparatory work is being done in Mindoro. This program will be carried out in all parts of the country where large tracts of public land may be available for rice production until this unwholesome dependence upon outside supplies shall have been solved. It will insure abundance and conserve the 60 million pesos we remit abroad annually for our rice importation.\r\nWe must turn our concentrated attention to the development of Mindanao. Something must be done without loss of time to convert that vast region into a real empire of wealth. I recommend a general program of road construction to encourage production and communication. The establishment of the planned hydro-electric and fertilizer plant in Maria Cristina Falls will give the proper agricultural and industrial incen\u00adtives. Locust pest is hampering the agricultural development of Northern Mindanao and even as far as Bohol and Cebu. I also recommend that sufficient appropriation be set aside to eradicate this winged enemy to our increased production.\r\nWe are having difficulties in the proper storage of rice, tobacco, copra and sugar. The construction of private or bonded warehouses for these products should be facilitated and encouraged.\r\nFishing is one of the most promising and flourishing industries of the country. But we are destroying this rich resource by the wanton use of dynamite in our sea and river fishing. This must be stopped. Let us put more teeth to the law on fishing.\r\nAct No. 2932 on the exploitation of our oil deposits is now regarded as obsolete. We should give more facilities for the exploration and exploitation of our oil deposits. This is a promising industry. The world demand for oil is unlimited. I have sent abroad a special mission to study not only oil legislation but also methods and procedure of exploitation. I hope that our representatives will be helpful in the revision of our legislation on the subject.\r\nWe are still a long way from our goal of wresting control of our retail trade.\r\nNo government in the world can merely legislate any people or any nation into business superiority and prosperity. But both our government and our people can cooperate to attain this natural and legitimate aim; the government, by providing a coordinate scheme of incentives to tide new enterprises over initial difficulties; and the people, by adopting a more courageous outlook and using opportunities and privileges with religious attention to attendant obligations.\r\nWe shall continue the organization of PRATRA branches and agencies and of the consumers cooperative associations, as procurement and distributing agencies for their members, and encourage the organ\u00adization of provincial trading corporations to minimize profiteering.\r\nWe have progressed in our revenue collections but we are still far from our ultimate goals. Those goals will have been reached when our financial position will have so improved as to enable us to provide adequately for all public services.\r\nWe should have more effective legislation to en\u00adcourage honest tax-paying and curtail tax evasion. The national revenues can be increased not only by raising the taxes not restrictive to new industrial en\u00adterprises but also by properly preventing tax evasion.\r\nWe are doing all in our power to train and organize our manpower resources for the national defense. But trained and courageous soldiers are not all that make an army. We must provide these men with the nec\u00adessary equipment and supplies within the financial capacity of the government.\r\nWe need to expand our military training. What we have been able to provide thus far is not adequate to produce a citizen army that can be mobilized on short notice and strong enough for national defense. It would be more productive of better results and more economical to encourage military training throughout our schools, colleges and universities rather than maintain a big standing army.\r\nWe will continue to adhere to the United Nations and we reaffirm our faith in its capacity to adjust in\u00adternational conflicts for the permanent peace of the world.\r\nIn the light of political developments in Southeast Asia, and the turbulent conditions in our immediate vicinity, the Philippines should further strengthen its position. Its leadership must be for constructive free\u00addom and peace and must insure the promotion and protection of the interests it shares in common with these states as well as its own.\r\nWe should adopt, for the security and stability of the Philippines, stricter safeguards against the entry or infiltration of subversive elements. Our home policy for peace and order must be strong. There must be national discipline. The government must be re\u00adspected, its laws obeyed. We cannot expect outsiders to respect our government if we do not respect it ourselves. We now enjoy that respect at home and abroad.\r\nLooking thus at the record since the establishment of our Republic and forward beyond the horizons of our charted course, I am deeply encouraged. We can face the future confident in our capacity to bring abundance, security and peace to our people, through the tested constitutional processes of freedom and democracy which constitute our enduring allegiance and loyalty.\r\nIn spite of tremendous odds, our progress and the continually growing respect and friendship of other nations confirm our potentialities and active growth in stature. They sustain, our broadening role in world affairs, particularly those affecting the Eastern world, definitely directing us towards a strategic position of creative influence. We need continually to so build and discipline ourselves that we may attain and deserve the privilege of its ministry. Our opportunity to this end is to muster and organize all our resources, preserve our credit and prestige abroad and guard against their dissipation at home.\r\nI call on every man and child of this nation to share in the privilege of the great tasks before us. I appeal for the utmost courage, wisdom, vision and dedication in taking up the challenge of our common objectives.\r\nWhen I assumed office, my only pledge was what I recited in my oath. I meant every word of it. My policy has been simple. I have had only two main immediate objectives: the restoration of peace and order, and the strengthening of the morale of the people and their faith and confidence in the government.\r\nI pledge to you, gentlemen of the Congress, my full cooperation in the greater tasks ahead, convinced that with Divine Guidance we will attain the goals we have set for ourselves to promote and safeguard \u2014 the wel\u00adfare of our country and our contribution to the peace and happiness of the world.\r\n:\r\nQuirino, E.

Congratulations, Senate President Manny Villar; Vice President Noli de Castro; President Ramos; Chief Justice Panganiban; Members of the diplomatic corps; senators; congressmen and congresswomen; other officials, ladies and gentlemen.\r\nSa araw na ito, nakatuon ang isip natin sa ating mga kababayan sa Lebanon. Nasa kuko sila ngayon ng malagim na paglala ng digmaan. Kahapon lamang, sinalubong natin ang unang 200 na Pilipinong lumikas doon; 500 pa ang mauuwi natin sa susunod na apat na araw.\r\nSa ating mga OFW, tunay kayong mga bagong bayani. Sa inyong paglilingkod sa pamilya, sa ating bayan, at sa Diyos, maraming salamat.\r\nSa ating mga kababayan, a journey of a thousand miles does not begin with a single step. It starts with the first step, with gathering the means to complete it successfully. Those means are now at hand.\r\nTo my friends in Congress who, in the face of grave political consequences, championed and passed some of the most severe and critical fiscal reforms to save our economy, maraming salamat. You are the true friends of the Filipino people. For the real challenge has never been to blame but to fix what is wrong in our country and our economy.\r\nDahil sa inyo, sa wakas may pondo na tayo, hindi lamang para ibayad sa interes, kundi para sa edukasyon, mas mabuting tulay at kalsada, pagbigay kalinga sa kalusugan at higit na trabaho sa ating bansa. Now, we have the money to pay down our debt and to build up our country.\r\nTo the civil servants who rose to the challenge of turning a weakening economy to a strong republic, through more vigorous tax collection and more vigilant action against corruption, maraming salamat. We have achieved record revenue collections. We are lining up corrupt officials to face the consequences of their misdeeds. And finally earned the respect of the international community as a serious and viable state for our fiscal discipline and billions of pesos in annual interest savings that are now going into necessary public investments.\r\nTo our men and women in the armed services, the huge and deep core of your loyalty has earned the nation\u2019s accolade. The few mutineers have been condemned by the people. They and their partisan cohorts and funders are being brought to justice. Sa nakararaming kawal at pulis na nagtaguyod ng watawat at Saligang Batas, maraming salamat.\r\nAnd at a time when we must each, as individuals and as communities, take greater responsibility, our local government officials man the frontline of change: change for greater accountability, for better service, and more responsiveness to their constituents. Sa inyong lahat, mga local government officials, maraming salamat.\r\nHigit sa lahat, salamat sa sambayanang Pilipino, para sa inyong mga sakripisyo, sa inyong tiyaga, for believing, in the face of the greatest hardships, in our ability to surmount the obstacles to the future you deserve; you who have resisted persistent if not pathetic calls for despair instead of faith, for anarchy instead of harmony, salamat, salamat, taos-pusong pasasalamat.\r\nSo I stand before you today to deliver a state of the nation that is focused on what the people want; the people want to know the plan to put us on the path to prosperity.\r\nI am not here to talk about politics; I am here to talk about what the people want; details on the state of the nation and what their government is doing to make progress every single day.\r\nSama-sama nating isusulong ang bansa patungo sa kinabukasang nagniningning.\r\nGaya ng nakikita sa graph na ito, dahil sa ating reporma sa ekonomiya, we now have the funds to address social inequity and economic disparity. Too many, masyadong marami, ang mamamayang nagugutom. Hindi ako hihinto hanggang magtagumpay ang ating laban sa kahirapan.\r\nWe now have the funds to stamp out terrorism and lawless violence.\r\nMay pondo na tayo para labanan ang katiwalian.\r\nOur reforms have earned us P1 billion from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account for more investigators, prosecutors, and new technology to fight corruption. We are matching this with another billion from our fiscal savings.\r\nWe now have the funds for constitutional and electoral changes. Sa kasalukuyang sistema, napakabagal ng proseso, at bukas sa labis na pagtutunggali, at sikil ang lalawigan at mamamayan sa paghahari ng Imperial Manila. Panahon nang ibalik ang kapangyarihan sa taumbayan at lalawigan. For surely, there must be a better way to do politics, so that those who lose elections do not make the country pay for their frustrated ambitions. There must be a better way so that those who win the nation\u2019s mandate to govern can work without delay and whimsical obstruction. There must be a better way.\r\nMeanwhile, now we can fund the Medium Term Public Investment Program. Sumusulong na ang ating plano na may tatlong yugto. Una, ang makaahon sa mga dekada ng utang at kapos ng pondo. Nagawa na natin ito. Ikalawang yugto, ang pagbabalik sa taumbayan ng mas malaking kita ng pamahalaan: upang makapagpundar ng kalinga sa kalusugan, edukasyon, at trabaho na kailangang-kailangan ng mamamayan. Ginagawa na rin natin ito. And finally, phase three: to invest in the natural advantages and natural resources of each section of our nation so that when harnessed together, the major economic regions of the nation are larger than the sum of its parts.\r\nWe will enhance the competitive advantage of the natural \u201csuper regions\u201dof the Philippines: the North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle, the Metro Luzon Urban Beltway, Central Philippines, Mindanao, and the Cyber Corridor.\r\nIn North Luzon, we will prioritize agribusiness investments. The agricultural and fisheries potential of the Cordilleras, Ilocandia, and Cagayan Valley can feed Luzon affordably. And nearness to North Asia holds the rich promise of agricultural exports and tourism.\r\nMy father built the Halsema Highway from Baguio to Bontoc, and the Bagabag airport in Nueva Vizcaya to access the Ifugao rice terraces, which by the way, the UNESCO has recently praised for the way we have carried out our heritage preservation policy. We have rehabilitated the Baguio to Mount Data leg of the highway and the rest of Halsema will now follow. We will upgrade the Bagabag airport and build a new one in Lallo, Cagayan, which will connect to Cordillera by upgrading the Tabuk-Tuguegarao Road.\r\nSa Tabuk, Kalinga, noong Abril, tumanggap ng titulo sa lupa ang ilang matatanda, pagkatapos nilang naghintay ng 20 taon mula noong napirmahan ang Mount Data Accord ng gobyerno at ng Cordillera People\u2019s Liberation Army. May isang matanda, suot ang lumang uniporme ng CPLA. Pumila, hila-hila ang isang binatilyo. Sabi niya, \u201cThis is not for me but for him.\u201d Agad inabot ang titulo sa apo. Narito ngayon si Ginoong Ama Balunggay at ang kaniyang apo si Jacob.\r\nAnd our postharvest support shall continue, like the cold chain that we set up in 2004 for La Trinidad, Benguet, under Mayor Nestor Fongwan. It consisted of a refrigerated storage facility and refrigerated trucks to deliver vegetables to Metro Manila. Nais kong tumaas ang kita ng mga magsasaka, at ang ina ng bawat tahanan ay makabili ng mura at sariwang gulay para sa kaniyang mga anak.\r\nSo that the people will know how well their money is spent, Benguet and its towns of Bakun, Bokod, and Itogon have rolled out the new electronic government accounting system in their jurisdictions.\r\nIfugao was able to cut its poverty in half in the first three years of our administration, from 56% to 28%. Congratulations. We hope that through these programs, the other provinces can replicate the success of Ifugao. Hangad nating dumami ang mga taga-Cordillera sa mga propesyon na tinitingalaan ng bayan, gaya ng mga abogadong sina Maurice Domogan at Romeo Brawner. Ibig din nating makapaghanda ang Cordillera sa awtonomiya pagdating ng pederalismo, ayon nawa sa pagbabago ng Saligang Batas.\r\nSa Dagupan, inilunsad na ng mga kolehiyo gaya ng Northwestern Lyceum University ang ladderized system of education. Sa ganitong sistema, magagamit sa unibersidad and mga kursong kinuha sa vocational school at ang karanasan sa trabaho.\r\nWe will expand President Ramos\u2019 flagship San Roque Multipurpose Dam with the massive Agno River Project. Another major project is the Banaoang Irrigation. We allocate P200 million a month for small irrigation projects like those in the flood control plan of the Region II Development Council headed by Bishop Ramon Villena. Plus another P200 million a month for farm-to-market roads.\r\nAlso in the works is an international airport in Poro, La Union, and the improvement of the two airports in Batanes as recommended by Governor Vic Gato. Ilocos Sur will have a seaport in Salomague, while the Cagayan Zone Authority will better the one in Port Irene.\r\nTo save dollars, windmills in Batanes and Ilocos Norte turn megawinds into megawatts. When Army Commander Romy Tolentino was North Luzon commander, he became a soldier-farmer, planting jatropha as yet another alternative fuel.\r\nThe Metro Luzon Urban Beltway spans most of Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Mindoro, and Marinduque. It must be a globally competitive urban, industrial, and services center because it produces more than half of the country\u2019s GDP.\r\nTo be world-class we invest in five comprehensive strategies for global competitiveness: (1) Make food plentiful and affordable to keep our labor cost globally competitive; (2) Reduce the cost of electricity to make our factories regionally competitive; (3) Modernize infrastructure at least cost to efficiently transport goods and people; (4) Mobilize, upgrade, and disseminate knowledge and technologies for productivity; and (5) Reduce red tape in all agencies to cut business costs.\r\nThe most prohibitive red tape is in our outmoded Constitution. We need Constitutional change to bring our rules of investment into the new millennium.\r\nThe new public bidding process has been shortened to 45 days for infrastructure, and 26 days for supplies, as of today. Even before this, Metro Manila firms paying bribes for public contracts declined from 57% in 2003 to 46% today. Congratulations, Metro Manila.\r\nMachine-readable electronic passports will enhance the credibility of Philippine travel documents, improve the mobility, and increase the prospects of Philippine business and labor.\r\nLegitimate mobility is hampered by human trafficking. Through the support of the USAID, we have convicted human traffickers with the Tongco spouses who were sentenced in a Quezon City court last December. These accomplishments removed us from the from the priority antitrafficking watchlist.\r\nTo lower power costs we introduced the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market last month. Let\u2019s give it a chance to work. And we would like big power consumers like electronics, our number one export, to avail of lower power rates from the National Power Corporation. On coco-biodiesel, we now have enough capacity for the proposed 1% blend just waiting to be passed into law.\r\nThe Subic-Clark corridor is on its way to a competitive international logistics center. This will be my legacy to my cabalens, jointly with Lito and Mark Lapid, Rey Aquino, Ana Bondoc, Blue Boy Nepomuceno, my son Mikey and Tarzan Lazatin. We jumpstarted it with giant investments in the Subic Seaport, the Clark Airport, and the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway.\r\nAnd to bring the beltway to the west we will connect the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Road to Dingalan Port through Nueva Ecija, and the Marikina- Infanta Road to the port of Real.\r\nUpang ibsan ang pagod ng mga empleyadong namamasahe sa trapiko sa Kalakhang Maynila, mangangapital tayo sa mga expressway at tren.\r\nWe will have a continuous highway from Clark to Metro Manila to Batangas Port. Tapos na iyong expressway mula Clark hanggang Maynila. Sa ngayon wala nang isang oras ang biyahe mula Clark hanggang Monumento. Ngayon iiwasan natin ang trapiko mula Monumento, dahil idudugtong natin ang North Expressway sa C-5. Tutulong si Sonny Belmonte sa right-of-way. Ang C-5 naman ay konektado na sa South Luzon Expressway. Ang South Luzon Expressway ay pinapalapad naman hanggang Calamba. Sa Agosto, pahahabain ito hanggang Batangas. We will also build the Coastal Road to Bacoor, which has become urban under Jesse Castillo.\r\nPagdurugtungin natin ang MRT at LRT mula Monumento hanggang North EDSA upang mabuo ang biyahe paikot sa Kamaynilaan, at maibsan ang trapik. We will construct the Northrail to Clark and the Southrail to Lucena and on to Bicol, and upgrade the link between them. We will also extend the LRT to Bacoor. Sa pagbilis ng biyahe patungo at palabaas ng Metro Manila, makakatira ang manggagawa sa mas mura at maaliwalas na lalawigan.\r\nMaayos na ang kapaligiran sa riles ng tren sa South Superhighway. Masaya ang mga pamilyang hinatid namin ni Vice President Noli de Castro sa kanilang bago at permanenteng relokasyon. Teddy Boy Locsin said it hadn\u2019t been done before, and couldn\u2019t be done at all. Well, Teddy?\r\nNgayon gagawin ito sa Maynila, si Lito Atienza ang bahala.\r\nWe thank China for agreeing to fund these housing needs. Huwaran ng ating programang pabahay para sa mahihirap ang mga proyekto ng Iglesia ni Kristo at Gawad Kalinga.\r\nNgunit kapos sa tubig ang mga taga-West Zone ng Kamaynilaan. Kaya bibigyan natin ng prayoridad hindi lamang ang edukasyon, kuryente, enerhiya, at kalusugan, kundi tubig din. We are setting up a 300 million liter per day pumping station for Muntinlupa, Las Pi\u00f1as and Para\u00f1aque.\r\nWe will build a roll-on-roll-off port system to link Lucena, Quezon, to Boac, Marinduque, like the Batangas-Mindoro RORO.\r\nSa ganitong mga proyekto, palalakasin natin ang ekonomiya ng mga barangay at lalawigan. And we will end the long oppression of barangays by rebel terrorists who kill without qualms, even their own. Sa mga lalawigang sakop ng 7th Division, nakikibaka sa paglaban si Jovito Palparan. Hindi siya aatras hanggang makawala sa gabi ng kilabot ang mga pamayanan at maka-ahon sa bukang-liwayway ng hustisya at kalayaan.\r\nIn the harshest possible terms I condemn political killings. We together stopped judicial executions with the abolition of the death penalty. We urge witnesses to come forward. Together we will stop extrajudicial executions.\r\nCentral Philippines has the competitive edge in tourism in its natural wonders and the extraordinary hospitality of its people. The area sweeps across Palawan and Romblon, the Visayas and Bicol, plus the northern Mindanao islands of Camiguin, Siargao, and Dapitan. Topbilled by Boracay, Cebu, Bohol, and Palawan, it attracts more than half of the foreign tourists to the Philippines. It is also the center of geothermal power in the country, which we continue to develop.\r\nThe priority here is tourism investments. Coming soon for superstar Boracay are an instrument landing system for the Kalibo airport and a P3 billion private investment in a San Jose, Romblon, airport, plus good roads to spillover destinations all over Panay.\r\nIn Cebu, Gwen Garcia is constructing a world-class convention center for the ASEAN and East Asian Summits in December.\r\nHelping our infrastructure upgrading is the fall in bribery for public sector contracts in Metro Cebu, from 62% of companies in 2004 to 47% today. Congratulations to Cardinal Vidal for shepherding his flock and to Metro Cebu Mayors Osme\u00f1a, Ouano, and Fernandez, and Metro Cebu representatives del Mar, Cuenco, Gullas, and Soon-Ruiz.\r\nBohol became a destination distinct from Cebu since it defeated the terrorist insurgency with community initiatives led by the power tandem of Rico Aumentado and General Johnny Gomez, now the NCR Commander. It now merits its own international airport, just as our country deserves a world-class Constitution strongly supported by Governor Aumentado and the league of local authorities.\r\nTourism in Palawan requires the upgrading of the airports of Puerto Princesa, Busuanga, San Vicente (hometown of Congressman Alvarez that\u2019s why he\u2019s clapping) and the building of a new one in Balabac; as well as a continuous road backbone from El Nido to Bataraza.\r\nWe will lengthen the Dumaguete runway for tourism as well as electronics. Valencia, Negros\u00a0Oriental, could attract semiconductor firms with power rates subsidized by the geothermal field of Palimpinon. Negros will also advance energy independence with ethanol projects in San Carlos City and Tamlang Valley once the biofuel law is passed. (You have done your part, Migs.)\r\nWe will serve Guimaras by the airport being built in Santa Barbara, Iloilo, and by a new RORO port in Sibunag. We will link Sipalay via Silay airport funded by the national government and Kabankalan airport being built by its local government. Thank you.\r\nFor Bicol\u2019s whale sharks, beaches and, of course, Mount Mayon, we have started acquiring the right of way for an international airport in Daraga, Albay. We will provide the means to the perfect surfs of the Pacific by upgrading the airports of Siargao, Guiuan, and Tacloban.\r\nWe will widen the road to Dakak in Dapitan, and RORO will connect Siquijor to Santander, Cebu; Camiguin to Jagna, Bohol; Ubay, Bohol, to Maasin, Southern Leyte, for diving in Limasawa.\r\nWe will bring Masbate and Biliran into the RORO Eastern Nautical Highway from Surigao through Leyte through Naval and Maripipi in Biliran through Esperanza, Aroroy, and Burias Island in Masbate and on to Bicol. The much-awaited 10-megawatt generator set arrived in Masbate last Saturday. It is ready to power up the province before the end of the month.\r\nCamiguin, Romblon, and Camarines Norte got out of the list of poorest provinces in 2003. With tourism these provinces can become rich.\r\nAlso winning the war against poverty and calamity, undaunted by unimaginable catastrophe, the valiant people of Southern Leyte, under the leadership of Rosette Lerias and Oging Mercado (our Rudy Guliani) are rebuilding the lives of Saint Bernard and San Francisco from their tragic mudslides. Yesterday, I asked the Japanese government to help Southern Leyte implement an integrated management approach to deal with their critical ecosystem, like the one the World Bank has approved for the Bicol River Basin.\r\nMindanao is our priority for agribusiness investments in the south. Mindanao is mostly fertile and largely typhoon-free, exporting coconut products and high-value crops, and from its waters come 40% of the country\u2019s fish catch. Our investment priorities mirror those for North Luzon and more because Mindanao has the poorest regions and poorest provinces and because we have to spend on a logistics system linking it to the north.\r\nIn 2003 we introduced the RORO from Zamboanga del Norte through Negros, Panay, and Mindoro to Batangas. This system has slashed travel time from Mindanao to Luzon from 36 hours to 24 hours, and freight cost by 30%, so crucial to food shipments. Now we will develop more routes like the one from Cagayan de Oro through Camiguin, Bohol, Cebu, and Masbate to Bicol, the Central Nautical Highway.\r\nAlso in 2003, Sulu, Lanao del Sur, and Tawi-Tawi registered double-digit declines in poverty incidence from the year 2000. Congratulations.\r\nKitang-kita ang pag-ibayo ng mga isla ng Sulu, Basilan, at Tawi-Tawi. Nagbukas ang Jollibee sa Basilan. The Balikatan exercises with the United States, combined with the U.S. GEM program and other donor-assisted projects, have no doubt contributed to this.\r\nSa Sulu, isang araw ng Mayo, umuulan, nagwakas ang isang mahabang pagtutunggali nang pumasok ang mga kawal at sibilyan sa Kampong Bitan-ag sa Panamao na hawak ng mga rebelde. Nagyakapan at nagkamayan ang dalawang panig. Dahil sa matinding pagnanais para sa kapayapaan ni Marine General Ben Dolorfino, naganap ang pagkakasundo. Gayon natapos ang isang madugong kabanata. Congratulations, General Ben Dolorfino.\r\nSusi sa anumang pag-ibayo ang malakas na suporta at ma-abilidad na liderato ng pamahalaang local. Halimbawa, iyong \u201cfrom arms to farms\u201d ni Governor Ben Loong ng Sulu, with his caravan of tractors literally invading former rebel camps in his province. Congratulations.\r\nMahigit isang linggong nakaraan, dumating sa \u201cEleven Islands\u201d ang daan-daang rebeldeng at kanilang pamilya, sa pamumuno ng dating MNLF Commander na si Aribari Samson. Dito sa mga pulo na kilalang \u201cno man\u2019s island\u201d dati nagtatago ang mga rebelde at criminal. Ngayon sa tulong ng isang programa ng United Nations, nagtayo tayo ng 200 tahanan at panibagong buhay para sa pangkat ni Samson. Thank you for giving peace a chance. Congratulations, Commander Samson.\r\nI take this occasion to express our gratitude to the donor community from the U.S., the Organization of the Islamic Conference [OIC], and the European Union, Australia, Japan, our ASEAN neighbors, the multilaterals, and the rest of the world. Thank you for helping us in our peace process.\r\nIf we can harness the forces of good in our nation, the positive force at work here at home and those from abroad such as the U.S., Malaysia, the OIC, and others, we shall prevail in Mindanao with a peace agreement that brings freedom and hope to all Filipinos. With this peace, we would reap dividends in resources invested in agribusiness, not aggression, to build up, not tear down, the Philippine south.\r\nAmong the possible peace dividends would be pro-poor road projects like the Siocon-Sirawai-Sibuco-Baligyan Road in Zamboanga del Norte; the Lebak to Maguindanao which Sim Datumanong started when he was Secretary of Public Works; the Dinagat Island road network in Surigao Del Norte; the Hawilian-Salug-Sinakungan barangay road in Agusan del Sur; the Pangil Bay Bridge; and the Surigao-Davao Road, which we want to be as beautiful as the Bukidnon Highway completed during the administration of Joe Zubiri and the term of Migs Zubiri.\r\nMindanao\u2019s number one export, coconuts, has been growing continuously for the last three years, at the rate of 10% a year. The coconut farmers deserve a portion of the peace dividend. I invite Congress and the Bishops-Ulama-Priests-Pastors-Farmer-Lumad Conference led by Archbishop Fernando Capalla to help me ensure their rightful share.\r\nOn top of peace and investment, progress also demands good governance. I congratulate Donkoy Emano for the drop in reports of corruption for public contracts in Cagayan de Oro from 65% of firms last year to 38 this year. Also Rudy Duterte and the other leaders of Metro Davao led by Majority Leader Boy Nograles for a similar drop, 57% last year to 49 now. Things are coming together for Mindanao, a prelude to their readiness for eventual federalism.\r\nThe Cyber Corridor will boost telecommunications, technology and education. The corridor runs the length of all the super regions, from Baguio to Cebu to Davao. The cities of Davao, Tagum and Samal Island Garden all operate electronic government accounting systems. There are many wings now to the corridor because enterprising local executives like L-Ray Villafuerte and Jerry Trenas have aggressively attracted call centers to their jurisdictions. (Congratulations, Jerry.) In this corridor, the English and information and communication technology [ICT] skills of the youth give them a competitive edge in call centers and other business process outsourcing [BPO].\r\nIn 2001, in this hall, we hailed ICT as a key growth sector. So we built up telecommunications infrastructure and opened the market for Internet phone calls. Today international calls cost 6 cents a minute, down from 40 cents. From 2,000 BPO workers in 2001, we now have 200,000.\r\nI had coffee with some call center agents last Labor Day. Lyn, a new college graduate, told me, \u201cNow I don\u2019t have to leave the country in order for me to help my family. Salamat po.\u201d I was so touched, Lyn, by your comments. With these structural reforms, we not only found jobs, but kept families intact. Thank God, I thought, or someone might also try to impeach me for violating Article 15 of the Constitution on the solidarity of the family as the foundation of the nation.\r\nAs Louie Villafuerte argues, to step into the future, a country that wants to be a player in the global economy needs bold and well-funded research and development initiatives of its own. To this end, we will continuously increase the budget for science and technology and education. For in today\u2019s global economy, knowledge is the greatest creator of wealth.\r\nIn summary, I named only a few priorities to illustrate that on many fronts, your government is working, and working well. Our economy is now growing over the longest period in the last quarter-century: 22 consecutive quarters of growth. Umakyat ng mahigit 30% ang kita ng pinakamahihirap na pamilya sa unang tatlong taon ng ating panunungkulan, at bumaba ang dami ng maralita sa 25% ng mga pamilya, mula 28%, katumbas ng 2 milyong katao na lumaya sa kahirapan. According to Thornton and Punongbayan, 70% of medium-sized business owners are optimistic, the fifth most optimistic among 30 countries, just behind India, Ireland, South Africa, and China.\r\nBickering in politics may delay, but not derail, the initiatives that need to be taken on our pro-poor, pro-growth, and pro-peace agenda. Regardless of the fate of the national budget, we must automate our election process. Local governments must get their rightful share of revenues. I ask Congress to pass a supplemental budget to effect this.\r\nWe are a great people. We have honest students and honest cops. We have scaled the heights of Mount Everest, dominated the Southeast Asian games, we have won international beauty titles, and of course punched our way to triumph in the boxing world. Our people compete and win every day in every imaginable job throughout the world. Individually, we\u2019ve taken the world on and won; together, we must take on the challenge of creating a new, peaceful, humane, and competitive nation and prevail.\r\nFor those who want to pick up old fights, we\u2019re game but what a waste of time. Why not join hands instead? Join hands in the biggest challenge of all, where we all win or we all lose: the battle for the survival and progress of our one and only country.\r\nAfter 3 years, 11 months, and 6 days, I shall relinquish the Presidency, with much if not all that I have outlined completed. I do not want it said then that, in the end, I defeated my enemies. I would rather have it said that all of us, you and I, friends and foes today, achieved together a country progressive, prosperous, and united.\r\nThank you. Mabuhay!", "title": "Sixth State of the Nation Address"},
{"delivered": "2003-07-28 19:52:09+00:00", "author": "Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambasa, Quezon City, on\u00a0July 28, 2003]\r\nThank you Speaker de Venecia.\r\nVice President Guingona; President Ramos; Senate President Drilon; Chief Justice Davide and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; distinguished members of the Senate and House of Representatives; His Excellency Archbishop Franco and excellencies of the diplomatic corps; members of the Cabinet; General Abaya and the officers of the Armed Forces; General Ebdane and the members of the police; fellow workers in government; ladies and gentlemen.\r\nYesterday, without bloodshed, without damage to property, and within a single day, we overcame an ill-conceived mutiny carried out by misguided military officers. Such actions are deplorable and will be met with the full force of the law, including their political component. Yet they signal an underlying problem that we must address.\r\nI am constituting an independent commission to investigate the roots of the mutiny and the provocations that inspired it. At the request of Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes, I am also constituting an independent commission to investigate the Davao bombing.\r\nThese will be matched by a PNP Reform Commission. I thank the National Police for their solid support in yesterday\u2019s crisis, and I am sure they themselves welcome a comprehensive reform that will cure the organization not only of the failures of the scale of the Al-Ghozi escape, but also the daily devils that are the kotong cops.\r\nBy now, we should be at peace: at peace in the south, at peace in the countryside, safe in our homes and secure in our communities. But we remain at war\u2014at war against terrorism; at war against corruption; at war against disease; at war against drugs\u2014the greatest menace facing our country today.\r\nLast five weeks, we\u2019ve struck a major blow against the drug menace. Eight billion pesos in five weeks. It is a pity that a few days later after the penultimate success against the drug menace, we should find ourselves at war against destabilizers.\r\nWe cannot stay divided with so much we need to do together. I address myself not only to the joint houses here assembled, but to the nation-at-large.\r\nI need you; we need each other.\r\nIyon ang aking sinabi nang naluklok ako bilang pangulo noong 2001. Sinabi ko noon na panahon na ng paghilom sa ating lipunan.\r\nAt sa aking unang State of the Nation Address, pinagdiinan ko ang mga batayang hangarin ng karaniwang Pilipino: trabaho, pagkain sa bawat mesa, tahanan, edukasyon.\r\nI gave my targets.\r\nI am submitting to the Congress and to the nation a technical report of my government\u2019s performance. In sum I can say, we delivered in great part on our commitments. Hindi lumampas ang dalawang buwan pagkatapos noong State of the Nation Address, noong 9/11, nagbago ang mundo. sa mga batayang hangaring trabaho, pagkain sa bawat mesa, tahanan, at edukasyon, ating idinagdag ang kapayapaan.\r\nNgunit dahil hindi pa matatag ang ating republika, hindi pa natin maaasahan na kung ang isang pangulo ay mag-uutos parang isang presidente ng isang korporasyon, ay maiintindihan at susunod kaagad ang mga institusyon at burokrasya. In a nation whose institutions are still fragile, a leader cannot run a developing country like a corporation.\r\nFor the practical purposes of most people, government exists to provide jobs, homes, education, peace, food on every table. And to do that adequately and dependably, government must possess the capacity to execute good policy and deliver basic services through strong and responsive institutions staffed by a competent and dedicated bureaucracy. In short, government must be the arm of a strong republic.\r\nBut a strong republic does not happen overnight; not even in two or three years. Nor does it happen once and for all.\r\nIn this setting, the first virtue of a modern leader is a constant sense of correct perspective, the capacity to retain her original focus, and plod on regardless. She must stick to priorities that were carefully chosen, rather than dump them at every first issue that is recklessly raised. I have stuck to my priorities: jobs, food on every table, homes, education, peace.\r\nMany of our reforms have yet to bear fruit, but in the fullness of time our country will reap what was carefully picked, planted, and nurtured. And it will be a harvest of plenty.\r\nThe harvest has in fact started.\r\nSa kapayaan:\r\nWe have hit hard at terrorism and, with the help of Speaker Joe de Venecia, made advances towards a negotiated peace on two fronts: the MILF and the NDF.\r\nSa susunod na linggo, magsisimula na ang pag-uusap ng peace panels ng gobyerno at MILF tungo sa isang panghuling kasunduang pang-kapayapaan. We will avail of the good offices of Malaysia in the search of a political solution to the conflict with the MILF, while looking to the help of the United States in the rehabilitation of conflict areas and the eradication of the roots of war. We\u2014all of us Filipinos\u2014have to decide now, once and for all, whether we want peace or we want war. There is no way to peace. Peace is the way. Subalit kung ipagpipilitan ng ilang mga kaaway ng ating republika ang digmaan, wala akong magagawa kung hindi tapatan sila upang ipagtanggol ang ating mga kababayan.\r\nI thank the senate for ratifying seven UN conventions against terrorism. I asked them to ratify the remaining five. Hinihingi ko rin sa kongreso na ipasa na ang Anti-Terrorism Law, at isama rito ang pagpataw ng mabigat na parusa sa kapabayaan sa pangangalaga ng mga pinaghihinalaang terorista.\r\nKasama ng terorismo, ang problema ng droga, ang pinag-uugatan ng matinding pagkabahala ng mga mamamayan tungkol sa kanilang personal na kaligtasan. Ang katiwaliang nilikha ng kalakal sa droga ay malalim ang lagos at bumabagtas sa lahat ng sector. Dapat nating kapootan ang walang pakundangang pagsira sa buhay ng ating mga mamamayan na maaaring humantong sa pagkawasak ng ating mga institusyong demokratiko.\r\nKapag nakakausap ko ang mga magulang ng mga drug addict, nawawasak ang aking puso, ngunit lalong tumitibay ang loob ko na tama ang aking desisyong itaas ang antas ng ating paglaban sa bawal na gamot. Dadalhin ko ang labang ito sa bawat lalawigan at lungsod hanggang umabot sa mga barangay upang kumatok tayo sa mga pinto ng bawat pamilyang Pilipino. This is one fight I am taking everywhere, if we have to knock on every door. Maglulunsad tayo ng kampanya sa mga paaralan at mga komunidad para sagipin ang kabataan at bigyan ng bagong buhay ang mga drug users at tiyaking hindi sila malulong muli! Pipigain natin ang supply sa kalye sa paraang kahit na ang masalapi ay mahihirapang sustentuhan ang kanilang bisyo. Pipilayan natin ang operasyon ng mga drug lords at ng kanilang mga padrino sa mga pasilyo ng kapangyarihan.\r\nI thank Congress for passing the Anti-Money Laundering Lawbecause it will help us interdict the money of the drug lords. I am now instructing the Secretary of Budget and Management to allocate a hundred million pesos for its implementation.\r\nIto ang ating laban at tayo ay magtatagumpay. Para sa mga big fish sa ilegal na droga, mahirap na ang mag-moratorium sa death penalty. Ngunit sa ibang bagay, pro-life pa rin ako. I will veto any bill that will try to smuggle in abortion.\r\nTungkol sa edukasyon:\r\nIn 2001, I said that our English literacy gives us a competitive edge in ICT. I also said that to prepare the youth to be the next generation of knowledge workers, we will upgrade math and science teaching in basic education. Kaya dinagdagan natin ang oras para sa math at English at pinag-ibayo ang laman ng science sa bagong curriculum. Nagtayo tayo ng eskwelahan sa 600 barangay na dati\u2019y walang paaralan. Sinisimulan natin ang distance learning program o education TV para sa apat na raang pamayanang malayo at kulang ang guro.\r\nAt kagaya ni Senate President Franklin Drilon, samahan n\u2019yo akong magtayo ng silid-aralan sa lahat ng paaralang lumalampas sa 100 mag-aaral bawat silid. In that way, we can once and for all close the perennial school building gap.\r\nTungkol sa tirahan:\r\nTayo ay nakapagtayo ng higit 100,000 bahay para sa mga maralita at halos 200,000 para sa mga manggagawa. Binigyan din natin ng katiyakan sa lupang tinitirikan ang halos 300,000 na mahihirap na pamilya. Pinagtibay natin ang ancestral domain ng mga katutubo sa mahigit 360,000 ektarya ng lupain.\r\nTungkol sa pagkain sa bawat mesa:\r\nSelf-rated hunger according to the surveys has gone down to 6.6 percent compared to 12.7 percent just before I became president. Mayroon tayong pirmihang supply ng bigas sa halagang P16.00 bawat kilo para sa mahihirap.\r\nAt ayon sa masugid na pag-monitor ni Mar Roxas, ang ating Secretary of Trade, mula noong ako\u2019y naging pangulo, nanatiling P8.50 ang halaga ng pangmasang sardinas, P11.00 ang mantikang lapad, P23.00 ang mantikang long neck, P28.00 ang puting asukal, P23.00 ang brown sugar, P28.00 ang kondensada, P115.00 ang baboy, P90.00 ang manok, at P160.00 ang baka. Matatag itong mga presyo mula nang ako\u2019y naging pangulo. Dahil dito, ngayon pinakamababa ang ating inflation rate sa loob ng 20 taon. Malamang, ito ay dahil ang aking administrasyon sa tulong ng kongreso ay taun-taon gumugugol ng 20 bilyong piso para sa makataong modernisasyon ng agrikultura.\r\nNamahagi tayo ng halos kalahating milyong ektarya sa ilalim ng reporma sa lupa. Mas marami pa tayong magagawa sa 38 bilyong pisong inilaan para dito ng desisyon ng Korte Suprema tungkol sa nakaw na yaman.\r\nI congratulate the Supreme Court for finally granting what has taken much too long to materialize: authorizing the allocation and use of private loot for laudable public purposes.\r\nHinihiling ko sa Kongreso na maglaan ng bahagi nitong pondo bilang kabayaran sa mga naging biktima ng paglabag sa karapatang pantao noong Martial Law.\r\nMas malaki rin ang maitutulong ng gobyerno sa mga magsasaka ng niyog ngayon na naresolba na pabor sa magsasaka ang kaso ng coco levy. Uulitin ko ang sinabi ko noon pang 2001, sisiguruhin ko na makikinabang sa coco levy ay ang mga maliliit na magniyu-niyog. Hindi ko sila pababayaang madehado.\r\nI said that there could be a million new jobs in agriculture and fisheries. We have provided more than half of that number two-thirds into my term.\r\nNgunit upang mabuo ang 1 milyon, kailangan isabatas natin ang panukalang gamitin ang bukirin bilang kolateral sa utang para lumawak ang daan sa rural credit at kapital. To the countless incentives that Congress has granted to business, I\u2019ve matched similar programs to give a similar break to the worker in the factory and in the farm.\r\nI do not subscribe to trickle down economics and social policy. Those who have less in life should not have to scramble for crumbs at the feet of those with too much on the table. Bilang pakikipag-ugnayan sa mga pinakamahirap ng ating bansa hinggil sa pinakamalubhang mga problema natin, dinalaw ko ang mga di kilalang barangay.\r\nNawasak ang aking puso nang narinig kong namatay ang Calisaan quadruplets. Lalong nakumbinsi akong pag-ibayuhin ang mga serbisyong pangkalusugan, gaya nang mabuti nating paglaban sa SARS. Ngayon, ang mga gamot na madalas gamitin ng mahihirap ay nabibili sa kalahating presyo sa mga ospital ng gobyerno.\r\nSa PhilHealth insurance naman, bago ako naging pangulo, isa\u2019t kalahating milyong maralita ang sakop. Ngayon, halos 7 milyon na. Gusto kong palawakin ang mga ito, ang murang gamot, at dapat hangarin natin na lahat ng dukha ay masakop sa PhilHealth. And to finance the universal coverage of PhilHealth, I ask Congress to pass the bill on the indexation of sin taxes.\r\nTungkol sa trabaho:\r\nSinabi ko noong 2001 na upang dumami ang trabaho, kailangang isaayos ang klima para sa pamumuhunan. Our economy grew by 4.4 percent GNP last year and 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. Only China and Vietnam did better.\r\nAng kahirapan ay unti-unting nagagapi. Self-rated poverty again according to the survey, is at its lowest percentage of the population in the last 16 years. Foreign investments rose 26 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. But we need to reduce the risk of living, not to mention doing business here, which is why yesterday\u2019s rogues must go to jail.\r\nWe can reduce business costs by providing basic infrastructure: roads, transport, and a more efficient and rationalized power sector. Our road program is symbolized by the long-awaited expansion of the North Expressway.\r\nOn mass transport, towards the end of this year, we will complete the loop of the light railway system of Metro Manila\u2014from Santolan in Pasig towards Aurora Boulevard in Cubao, and on to Quiapo to Blumentritt on to EDSA in Pasay and back to Cubao. Hindi tumaas ang pasahe mula noong una kong State of the Nation Address. Kaya mga jeepney drivers, nagpapasalamat ako; hindi ko kayo pababayaan.\r\nTo reduce transport costs from Mindanao to Luzon, we set up the nautical highway, a system where the cargo truck itself travels straight to its destination, making inter-island crossings on ferries, rather than loading and unloading at every port. This has reduced by 30 percent the transport costs of products from Mindanao like copra, rice, corn, and vegetables.\r\nNagbigay tayo ng kuryente sa mahigit 3,600 barangay. While in Metro Manila, a consumer using 100 kilowatt hour paid P526.48 last May. Today, he pays P423.20, a drop of over 100 pesos or 20 percent. His case is one of almost 2 million households benefiting from the lifeline rate program of the Energy Regulatory Commission. Another 119 electric cooperative franchise areas will also soon reduce their rates under the loan condonation program of the Electric Power Reform Act that you, Congress, passed in 2001. That is why, believe me when I say that from having the second most expensive power in Asia Pacific, we now rank seventh.\r\nBut we will need 6,000 megawatts more of power over the next 10 years. That is why we need to pass the Transco Bill to maintain a favorable ranking as we take on this added capacity. When we reduce business costs, the last should be wages, and the first should be red tape.\r\nKaya nagsasagawa ako ng sorpresang pagbisita sa mga tanggapan ng gobyerno, upang pasiglahin ang talagang nagsisikap at gisingin kung sino ang natutulog sa trabaho. Pinalakas natin ang pambansang ekonomiya\u2014agrikultura, maliliit na negosyo, pabahay\u2014upang anumang mangyari sa dayuhang ekonomiya, matatag pa rin ang Pilipinas.\r\nNaglaan tayo ng 10 bilyong piso para sa murang pautang sa maliliit na negosyo. Nagamit na ito, kaya dadagdagan muli natin ng higit pa sa 10 bilyon.\r\nAng interest rates ay patuloy na bumababa. Good monetary policy and fiscal discipline and balance are the key. Our revenues surpassed the target by 21 billion pesos in the first five months of this year, driven by information technology, and helped by lifestyle checks, and 50 indictments and dismissals for graft and corruption. Thus, we held the budget deficit in check at 22 percent below ceiling.\r\nI thank Congress for passing our e-Procurement Law because it helps us hold down expenditures. Now, I ask Congress to complete the passage of the bills on excise tax rationalization and the national revenue authority. But we must reduce corruption not only among appointive but also among elective officials.\r\nWith full financial support to my government, the registration, counting, and transmission of votes in the May 2004 elections will be completely computerized. Now, I ask congress to institute reforms in campaign finance to level the playing field and widen the choice of the electorate for worthy candidates. The strength of our investment climate also rests in great part on the realities of the global and regional environment and on how we turn those realities to our advantage.\r\nOur country has come much closer to reattaining its strategic importance in geopolitics as an active and respected voice in international affairs. The Filipino is now recognized as a truly global worker, both at home and abroad. We have had the smallest number of strikes in the last 21 years. Increasingly, the Philippines is being recognized as an ideal site for critical operations requiring a high-quality, English-educated workforce. Eight million Filipinos live and work abroad, in jobs where they enjoy the unbeatable comparative advantages of an English-speaking education, advanced skills, and a uniquely caring nature.\r\nThe Filipino will work anywhere because he is not afraid. Like Manny Pacquiao, given the chance to compete, he will take it and he will win. It was only fitting that because of your work in Congress, overseas Filipino workers were given the overseas voting right. It was also fitting that I put in a new perspective on our relations with the United States, where three million Filipinos live and where I made a visit as their only state visitor for the year. The benefits of our engagement with the U.S. vastly outweigh any concerns about sovereign subordination. We should have the confidence to deal with other countries as equals\u2014however rich, however strong, be they China, Japan, the members of the European Union or the United States.\r\nWe have reached out to good friends and neighbors\u2014such as Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia and President Megawati of Indonesia\u2014with the message that we must work together especially where democracy and security are concerned.\r\nAng panguluhan ay laging nahaharap sa mabibigat na suliranin. Terrorism, drugs, SARS, OFWs, Mindanao, poverty, corruption, investments, destabilization\u2014these come to mind as we review the crises and opportunities of the past year. They sum up the problems we faced and the extraordinary responses that we made, surprising even ourselves and reviving faith in our future.\r\nBarangay Vacante, Alcala, Pangasinan, got the SARS, took the hit, fought on, and valiantly overcame the crisis. Barangay Inug-ug, Pagalungan, Maguindanao, politely asked the MILF and the military to leave and take their fight elsewhere, thereby making their community a sanctuary of peace.\r\nSi Sonny Ayao, umayaw sa giyera at naging community organizer kahit na s\u2019ya ay naging MNLF sa edad na 12, at pagkatapos maging Mujahideen sa loob ng 27 taon.\r\nThe Filipinos of Kuwait, isolated by war but refusing to abandon their jobs, took care of themselves and the people around them during the Iraq conflict. Teacher Josette Biyo of Iloilo, world champion in science and math teaching, has a planet in the solar system named after her. Luz Lozada, 72 years old, ng San Isidro, Davao del Sur\u2014hinirang na natatanging magsasaka. She is the image model of hybrid rice technology, the symbol of our agricultural modernization. Police officers Cayetano Gannaban and Raul Graza fought off 20 rebels in a firefight in Quinapondan, Eastern Samar. Police Colonel Boysie Rosales, kilabot ng mga drug lords, tumanggi sa suhol na P35 million. Hinahangaan ko ang gilas ng maraming Pilipino, ang malalim nating kaban ng kabayanihan at talino, ang ating matibay na kalooban upang mabuhay, maglingkod, at mangibabaw.\r\nAng ating pangarap ay walang kabawas-bawas\u2014isang matatag na republikang hindi matitinag ng makasariling interes, yumayabong sa mga gumaganang institusyon ng pamamahala, naglilingkod sa isang masipag na lipi saan man ito kailangan upang maibigay sa kanila ang karapat-dapat nilang tanggapin.\r\nA life of leadership is a difficult one, with few pauses for comfort and relief. These days, I find that rare moment of joy in the company of my family\u2014especially my granddaughter, Mikaela. Just as I will do everything to make sure that the future will be kind to Mikaela and her generation, so must we all strive to turn our fears into a resolve to do right not just by ourselves, but by our children and grandchildren.\r\nNasa giyera tayo. giyera laban sa terorismo. giyera laban sa katiwalian. giyera laban sa kasakitan. giyera laban sa droga. giyera laban sa destabilisasyon. Sa ating sama-samang pakikipaglaban at pagtutulungan, tayo ay mangingibabaw at magwawagi.\r\nNo agtutunos tayo nga agtrabaho, agba leygi tayo.\r\nAbe-abeng makilaban ampon mag-obra, mangibabo tamu.\r\nSa atong panaghiusa sa pagtrabaho ug pagbuntog sa mga kaaway, molampos gayod kita.\r\nSa aton pag-inupod sa mga ulubrahon kag sa pakipag-away, kita gid ang magpangibabaw.\r\nKasihan nawa ng Diyos ang Pilipinas.\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.\r\nSource: http:\r\n", "title": "State of the Nation Address"},

Aquino III", "text": "[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJxLsT29T8Y&[/youtube]\r\n[\r\n]\r\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 28, 2014]\r\nBise Presidente Jejomar Binay; dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos; Senate President Franklin M. Drilon at mga miyembro ng Senado; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. at mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga kasapi ng militar, pulis, at iba pang kawani mula sa ating unipormadong hanay; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan:\r\nMagandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.\r\nIto po ang aking ikalimang SONA, isa na lamang ang natitira. May kasabihan po tayo: Ang hindi lumingon sa pinanggalingan, hindi makararating sa paroroonan. Kaya marapat lang po siguro tayong magbalik-tanaw:\r\nNoon, sa sitwasyon natin: Para bang kahibangan ang mangarap. May burukrasyang walang saysay, patong-patong ang tongpats, at bumubukol ang korupsyon sa sistema. Naturingan tayong \u201cSick Man of Asia.\u201d \u00a0Ang ekonomiya natin, matamlay; ang industriya, manipis. Walang kumpiyansang mamuhunan sa atin pong bansa. Ang resulta: kakarampot ang trabahong nalilikha. Dinatnan nating tigang sa pag-asa ang mamamayang Pilipino. Marami sa atin ang sumuko at napilitang makipagsapalaran sa ibang bansa. Nakayuko na lamang nating tinanggap: Talagang wala tayong maaasahan sa ating pamahalaan at lipunan.\r\nNalugmok nga po ang Pilipinas dahil sa labis na pamumulitika. Naglaho ang pananalig natin sa isa\u2019t isa, humina ang kumpiyansa sa atin ng mundo, at ang pinakamasakit: Nawalan tayo ng tiwala sa ating mga sarili.\r\nSa puntong ito natin sinimulan ang pagtahak sa tuwid na daan.\r\nBilang ama ng bayan, nakaatang sa aking balikat, hindi lang ang mga suliraning ating dinatnan at mga lumilitaw sa kasalukuyan\u2014obligasyon ko ring paghandaan ang kinabukasan. Sa bawat sandali, kailangan kong isaalang-alang ang interes at punto-de-bista ng lahat. Isipin na lang po ninyo: Para kang nanonood ng 200 channel sa telebisyon nang sabay-sabay. Kailangan, alam mo, hindi lang ang kasalukuyang nagaganap, kundi ang pinanggalingan at paroroonan ng nilalaman ng bawat channel. Bawal malito, at kailangan, may tugon ka sa anumang tanong, suhestiyon, at kritisismo\u2014at dapat sagutin mo ito, bago pa iharap sa iyo. Hindi po madali ang trabahong ito, at tao lang po ako, na kung minsan, nagkakaroon din ng agam-agam.\r\nNgunit buo ang aking loob dahil malinaw ang aking pangunahing layunin: Ang ibalik ang gobyerno sa dapat nitong tuon\u2014ang paglingkuran ang taumbayan sa lahat ng panahon. [Palakpakan]\r\n\u2018Di po ba\u2019t may kasabihan tayo: Bigyan mo ng isda ang tao, at mapapakain mo siya ng isang araw. Turuan mo siyang mangisda, at habambuhay niyang mapapakain ang sarili niya. Halimbawa nito ay ang TESDA. Sa Training-for-Work Scholarship Program, nag-ambag ang DAP ng 1.6 billion pesos. Nakapagpatapos po ito ng 223,615 benepisyaryo. 66 percent po nito\u2014o katumbas ng 146,731 graduates\u2014ang nagtatrabaho na ngayon. Iyon naman pong 34 percent na natitira, tinutulungan na rin ng TESDA na makahanap ng trabaho. Tingnan po ninyo: Lahat po ng mga TESDA scholar, nakalista ang pangalan at iba pang datos, na puwede ninyong kumpirmahin. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung hahatiin natin sa bilang ng graduates ang naipagkaloob na pondo, pumapatak ng 7,155 pesos ang naipuhunan ng pamahalaan para sa training ng bawat scholar. Sa BPO sector, mababa na ang kitang 18,000 piso kada buwan. Kada taon, kikita siya ng 234,000 pesos. Ibigay man ang maximum tax deduction, ang magiging income tax niya kada taon: 7,900 pesos. Ibig-sabihin, ang pinuhunan ng estadong 7,155 pesos, sa unang taon pa lang, nabawi na, may sobra pa. Ito, at ang lahat ng ibubuwis ng ating scholar hanggang magretiro siya, ay magbibigay naman sa kanyang kababayan ng parehong pagkakataon. Ito po ang mabuting pamamahala [Palakpakan]: May tama pong intensyon, pamamaraan, at resulta. Lahat panalo.\r\nPakinggan po natin ang kuwento ng dalawang TESDA graduate:\r\n\u2018Pag naabot mo na \u2018yong pangarap mo\u2014success, hindi naman stable \u2018yon e. You need to work hard for it.\r\n\u201cAko po si Marc Joseph Escora. Ako po ay isang high school graduate. And through TESDA\u2019s help, I have my career in the BPO [business process outsourcing] industry right now.\r\n\u201cI stayed in Libertad public market for seven years. Nagba-barker po ako. Hindi kaya ng pamilya ko na pag-aralin kami nang sabay, so I need to find another way para makapagtapos ako.\r\n\u201cMost important thing na natutunan ko is \u2018yung confidence to interact with other people. \u00a0\u2018Pag nakita ka ng tao na may kapansanan ka, hindi na nila ni-look forward \u2018yung ability mo ba. Kailangan lang natin ng tiwala sa sarili.\r\n\u201cIf TESDA is not there to help out, siguro wala rin ako ngayon kung nasaan man ako ngayon. \u2018Yung way of living namin, masasabi kong mas okay siya compared noong dati.\u201d\r\n\u2013 Marc Joseph Escora, TESDA beneficiary [\r\n]\r\n\u201cDahil sa TESDA, napabilis \u2018yung pag-aaral ko, paghahanap ko ng trabaho, at ang pagtulong ko sa pamilya ko.\r\n\u201cAko po si Jonnalyn Navarossa, Technical Trainer ng Toyota Motor Philippines. Ako po \u2018yung naging overall topnotcher ng batch 1 sa automotive servicing sa TESDA Region 8. Napili ko po \u2018yung automotive servicing kasi po pangarap kong maging isang mechanical engineer. So para makapagtrabaho\u2019t magkapag-ipon, nag-TESDA po ako.\r\n\u201cNakasanayan na po natin na ang auto mechanic ay trabahong panlalaki lang. Pero napatunayan ko na basta masipag at determinado, magkakaroon tayo ng dekalidad na produkto. Dahil sa TESDA, tumatak po sa akin ang kahalagahan ng dekalidad at mahusay na pagtatrabaho. Mas tumaas \u2018yung tiwala ko sa aking sarili, at mas masarap nang mangarap nang malaki.\u201d\r\n\u2013 Jonnalyn Navarossa, TESDA beneficiary\u00a0[\r\n]\r\n[Palakpakan]\r\nNasimulan na rin po natin ang Expanded Conditional Cash Transfer Program nitong Hunyo 2014, na may pondong 12.3 billion pesos. Ngayon, suportado na rin ng estado hanggang umabot ng 18 taong gulang ang benepisyaryo. May magtatanong, \u201cBakit?\u201d Batay po kasi sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, 40 percent ang dagdag na sinasahod ng high school graduate, kumpara sa grade school lang ang natapos.\r\nNamumuhunan po tayo sa pinakamahalagang yaman ng bansa: ang taumbayan. Pinapatunayan ito ng datos ng NEDA. Ayon sa kanila, ang 27.9 percent na poverty incidence natin sa unang semester ng 2012, bumaba patungong 24.9 percent sa kaparehong panahon noong 2013. Ang three percentage points pong ito ay katumbas ng halos 2.5 milyon na Pilipinong nakaalpas na sa poverty line. [Palakpakan] Totoo namang dapat pagtuunan ng masusing pansin ang pinakamahihirap sa lipunan. Pero hindi tayo titigil diyan: Ngayong nadagdagan ang kakayahan natin, sinisikap nating hindi na manumbalik sa ilalim ng poverty line ang lahat ng nakaalpas na. [Palakpakan]\r\nDumating po tayo sa lipunang parang isang sirang bahay na hindi natin malisan. Ang malala pa dito, halos wala tayong kagamitan at materyales para ayusin ang sira. Nitong mga nakaraang taon, sa pakikiambag ng bawat mapagkapwang Pilipino, nabubuo na natin ang mga kagamitan at materyales na ito\u2014tulad po ng budget na tanging nakatuon sa pangangailangan ng mamamayan, at apat na sunud-sunod na taon na nating naipapasa sa tamang oras. Kasama nito ang mga batas na nagpapabilis ng pagdating ng pakinabang sa atin pong mga Boss.\r\nDito po\u2014sa isang patas na sistema\u2014nagsimula ang panunumbalik ng sigla ng ating ekonomiya. Nakatipid tayo dahil sa maayos na pangangasiwa ng pondo. Napapalawak natin ang saklaw ng mga serbisyo nang hindi nagtataas ng buwis, maliban sa Sin Tax Reform na layuning ibsan ang bisyo sa lipunan. [Palakpakan]\r\nNagtrabaho tayo para magkaroon ng kakayahang tustusan ang mga proyektong ipinatupad, ipinatutupad, at ipatutupad pa natin. Pinaigting natin ang pangongolekta ng buwis: mula sa koleksyong 1.094 trillion pesos noong 2010, naitaas na natin ito sa 1.536 trillion noong 2013. \u00a0[Palakpakan] Inayos natin ang pamamahala ng ating mga utang. Ang resulta: Bumaba ang ating debt to GDP ratio; ang perang dating dapat ibabayad sa interes, napupunta na sa social services. Pati ang mga obligasyong karamihan ay minana lang, natugunan din natin. Halimbawa po nito: 1993 pa po o panahon pa ni Pangulong Ramos nang itinakda ang obligasyong i-recapitalize ang Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas sa halagang 50 bilyong piso para magawa niya ang kanyang tungkulin. Ang napondohan ni Presidente Ramos, 10 bilyong piso, at hindi na nadagdagan pagkatapos noon. 40 bilyon ang kakulangang iniwan sa atin; nabayaran na po natin ito. [Palakpakan]\r\nPinaghirapan natin ang pondong mayrooon tayo ngayon, kaya\u2019t hindi po natin maaatim na waldasin lang ito. Kung pipili nga ng tamang pinuno ang ating mga Boss, malalagpasan pa ng susunod ang ating mga nagawa, dahil malaki na ang naibawas natin sa problema, at mas matayog na ang kanilang pagmumulan.\r\nBakit po mas matayog? Nitong 2013, sa unang pagkakataon, nagkamit tayo ng investment grade status mula sa Moody\u2019s, sa Fitch, at Standard and Poor\u2019s\u2014ang tatlong pinakatanyag na credit ratings agency sa mundo. Sa pagsusuri nila ng ating macroenomic fundamentals at governance, nabawasan ang riskong itinatala, kaya tumingkad ang kumpiyansa ng mga namumuhunan. Hindi pa nga po nakuntento ang Standard and Poor\u2019s: Nitong Mayo lang, panibagong upgrade na naman ang ibinigay nila sa atin. Ang hatid po nito: Dahil nga investment grade na tayo, mas murang mahihiram ng gobyerno ang pondo para sa mga programa at proyekto, mas maraming naaakit na mamumuhunan sa ating bansa, at mas mabilis na natatamasa ng Pilipino ang benepisyo. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung susumahin naman po ang lahat ng puhunang pumasok sa Philippine Economic Zone Authority simula nang itatag ito noong 1995, makikitang 42 porsyento ang pumasok sa apat na taon ng ating panunungkulan. Ang natitirang 58 percent, inabot ng 15 taon ang ibang mga administrasyon para bunuin. Kumpiyansa po tayo: bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto, papantayan o hihigitan pa natin ang halagang ito. Kay Director General Lilia de Lima: Salamat sa nagawa mo na, at gagawin pa, sa pagkamit ng tagumpay na ito. [Palakpakan]\r\nTalagang pa-take-off na ang ating ekonomiya at bansa, at inaabot na natin ang mas matatayog pang mithiin. Minana natin ang tila grounded na aviation industry: napatawan tayo ng significant safety concerns ng International Civil Aviation Organization, o ICAO, nabigyan ng downgrade ng United States Federal Aviation Administration, at nilagyan ng restriction ng European Union ang ating mga local carriers.\r\nNitong 2013, inalis na nga po ng ICAO ang significant safety concerns sa Pilipinas. Sa parehong taon, sinundan ito ng pagpayag ng European Union na muling lumipad ang Philippine Airlines patungong Europa, kaya direkta nang makakabiyahe ang Pilipino [Palakpakan] \u00a0mula Maynila po hanggang London. Malamang nga po, pasunod na ang Cebu Pacific dahil nabigyan na rin sila ng pahintulot ng EU ngayong 2014. Ngayong taon din, in-upgrade ng United States Federal Aviation Administration ang Pilipinas balik sa Category 1. Dahil dito, maaari nang dumagdag ang mga ruta papunta sa Estados Unidos. Sa larangan ng turismo at pangangalakal, malaki ang itinulong ng pagdami ng flights ng ating airlines tungo sa mga bansa kasapi ng EU at Estados Unidos .\r\nDumarating sa atin ang mga ulat na sa dami ng gustong bumisitang negosyante at turista sa ating bansa, dumarating ang mga panahong kulang na ang mga biyahe papunta rito. Magandang balita nga po ang mga upgrade: Dadami ang biyahe, kaya\u2019t matutugunan ang suliraning ito. At sa patuloy na pagtutulungan ng CAAP at ng ating mga local carrier, pihadong mas marami pa tayong maaakit na turista at negosyante sa mga susunod na taon. Panalo ang mga umaasa sa sektor ng turismo, panalo ang sambayanang Pilipino. Mabuting pamamahala po ang ugat ng mga tagumpay na ito. Nagpapasalamat nga tayo kina Director General William Hotchkiss, sa CAAP, at sa ating mga local carriers para sa inyong pagsusumikap. [Palakpakan]\r\nTalagang nasa sentro ng pandaigdigang entablado ang Pilipinas. Nito lang pong nakaraang Mayo, nagpakitang-gilas tayo sa tagumpay ng pagdaraos ng World Economic Forum on East Asia sa ating bansa. Ihahayag natin sa gaganaping APEC Summit dito sa susunod na taon ang kaunlarang nakakamit natin at ang pagkakataong hatid nito para sa lahat. Wala pong duda: More open for business na nga po ang Pilipinas. [Palakpakan]\r\nBukod po sa maaliwalas na pagnenegosyo, isinusulong din natin ang maayos na relasyon ng ating mga manggagawa at mga kompanya.\r\nIsipin po ninyo: Mula 2010, nananatiling mababa sa sampu ang bilang ng mga strike kada taon ayon sa National Conciliation and Mediation Board. Isa po itong positibong bunga ng itinataguyod nating Single Entry Approach, o SEnA, ng DOLE, kung saan dumadaan sa 30-day conciliation-mediation ang mga nakahaing labor cases. Ang maganda nga po: sa 115 notices of strike and lockout noong 2013, isa lang ang natuloy na welga. Ito ang pinakamababa sa kasaysayan ng DOLE. Maraming salamat po kay Secretary Linda Baldoz, sa pamilya ng DOLE [palakpakan] at siyempre po sa labor at management sectors. Minsan po ay nagkabiruan kami ni Secretary Baldoz, noong 2012 ho yata\u2019y \u00a0may dalawang strike, noong 2013, isa na lang, so nangangalahati nang nangangalahati. Sabi ko: Linda, sa 2014, hindi tagumpay \u2018yung may kalahating strike. Baka puwede, wala nang strike? [Tawanan at palakpakan]\r\nBatid rin natin: Para magpatuloy ang pag-angat ng ekonomiya at pagbukas ng pagkakataon, kailangan ng imprastruktura. Ito ang aakit sa mga negosyante, magpapabilis sa daloy ng produkto at serbisyo, at sisigurong kaya nating makipagsabayan sa iba pang merkado sa daigdig.\r\nNapakalaki po talaga ng pagbabago: Lampas doble na ang budget para sa imprastruktura, mula 200.3 billion pesos noong 2011, naging 404.3 billion pesos ngayong 2014. [Palakpakan] Paalala ko lang po: Hindi tayo nagdagdag ng buwis maliban sa Sin Tax Reform na nakatugon sa kalusugan, habang napanatili din ang ating allowable deficit, at patuloy na bumababa ang ating debt-to-GDP ratio. Malaki po ang epekto nito, dahil hindi lang lumaki ang pondo: binawasan pa natin ang mga tagas sa sistema, kaya natitiyak nating mas sulit ang bawat pisong ginagastos ng estado.\r\nSa pamumuno ni Secretary Babes Singson ng DPWH: Bawal ang tongpats, bawal ang bukol. Tinapalan na ang mga butas sa lumang sistema, at pinatag ang proseso sa ahensya. Isang simpleng halimbawa po nito ang pagtatanggal ng Letter of Intent sa bidding process. Noon po kasi, ginagamit ito bilang kasangkapan sa kuntsabahan\u2014kapag nalaman kung sino-sino ang bidders ng proyekto, binibigyan ng puwang ang sabwatan. Isa pa po: Ang mga dokumentong hinihiling mula sa bidders: lima na lang, mula sa dating 20. Mas mabilis ang proseso, at mas kaunti ang pagkakataong manghingi ng pampadulas o suhol. Ang resulta: Halos 28 bilyong piso ang naisalbang pondo, at napapaaga ang pagpapatupad ng mga susunod na proyekto. [Palakpakan] Kaya naman kay Sec. Babes at sa bumubuo ng DPWH: muli, maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat. [Palakpakan]\r\nHanep po talaga: Kasabay ng mga natipid ng DPWH, ang nailatag, napapaayos, napalawak, o naipagawa nilang kalsada mula nang maupo tayo, umabot na sa 12,184 kilometro. [Palakpakan] Nung nakita ko po itong numerong \u2018to, napag-isip rin ako: Paano ko ba maipapaliwanag \u2018yung labindalawang libo? Sabi po sa atin: katumbas ito ng apat na kalsadang nag-uugnay sa Laoag hanggang Zamboanga City. National roads lang po ito; wala pa rito ang mga local farm-to-market roads o tourism roads. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa Public-Private Partnership program naman po: Mula Disyembre 2011 hanggang nitong Hunyo, nakapag-award at nakalagda na ng pitong PPP projects ang inyong pamahalaan; ang halaga nito: tinatayang 62.6 billion pesos. Sa apat na taon natin sa tuwid na daan, nalampasan na natin ang pinagsamang anim lamang na aprubadong solicited PPP projects mula sa nakaraang tatlong administrasyon. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng laki na po talaga ng pinagkaiba ng noon sa ngayon. Sabi nga ni Secretary Cesar Purisima: Dati, hindi makaakit ang Pilipinas ng mga mamumuhunan. Noon, gobyerno pa mismo ang nag-aalay ng kaliwa\u2019t kanang insentibo, tulad ng pagbibigay ng commercial development rights, subsidy, at iba pang garantiya. Ngayon, baliktad na ang sitwasyon. Matindi ang kompetisyon ng mga nag-uunahang kompanya; handa silang magbayad para makuha ang pribilehiyong itayo ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin. Halimbawa po: Sa Mactan-Cebu International Airport Passenger Terminal Building, may premium ang gobyerno na umaabot sa mahigit 14 bilyong piso; sa NAIA Expressway Project Phase 2, nakakuha ang gobyerno ng prima na 11 bilyong piso. Muli: Mabuting pamamahala ang ugat ng lahat ng ito. [Palakpakan]\r\nTingnan naman natin ang TPLEX. Dahil sa kalsadang ito, maginhawa na ang biyaheng Tarlac hanggang Rosales sa Pangasinan. Ayon po sa kanila, ang bahagi hanggang Urdaneta, makukumpleto na bago matapos ang 2014. Sa susunod na taon, aabot na raw ang daang ito hanggang sa dulo sa Rosario, \u00a0La Union. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng mga imprastrukturang matagal nang ipinako sa pangako, atin na rin pong isinasakongkreto. Ang Aluling Bridge, na 1978 pa po binuo ang konsepto, bukas na sa publiko. Ang Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, na bahagi ng Metro Manila Expressway na proyekto pa noong dekada sitenta, inilunsad na natin noong Enero. Sa mga dumadaan ng Osme\u00f1a Highway, nakikita naman po ninyo kung gaano kabilis itayo ang mga haligi para dito. Ang Ternate-Nasugbu Road, na noon pang 1994 sinimulang ilatag ang plano\u2014100 percent complete na rin ngayon. [Palakpakan] Ang Basilan Circumferential Road, na year 2000 pang under construction, malapit na rin pong matapos. Hindi ko na ho sasabihin \u2018yung eksaktong petsa baka mausog pa. Pero \u2018pag hindi ho natupad, \u2018yung ipinangako sa atin ni Governor Hataman, sasamahan ko siya araw-araw hanggang matapos ito.\r\nIlan lang po ito sa mga imprastrukturang wala tayong planong ipamana bilang problema; sa halip, ngayon, nagsisimula na itong mapakinabangan ng ating mga Boss.\r\nMuli, dahil sa mabuting pamamahala, mas may kakayahan na tayong tugunan, maging ang mga problemang paparating pa lang. Halimbawa: sa tubig. Alam nating habang lumalago ang populasyon at umaangat ang ekonomiya, mas maraming tubig ang kakailanganin sa mga susunod na taon. Ayon nga po sa pag-aaral, maaaring magkaroon ng kakulangan ng tubig sa Metro Manila pagdating ng 2021. Hindi na po natin hihintayin ang tagtuyot: Ang mga solusyong talagang pinag-aralan ng mga dalubhasa, inaprubahan na po natin\u2014ang Kaliwa Dam Project sa Quezon, at ang pag-aayos ng mga linya ng Angat Dam. Magandang solusyon po ito kaysa kumuha ng tubig mula sa mga aquifer sa ilalim ng lupa, na mas madaling pasukin o magbibigay-daan para mas madaling pasukan ng tubig-alat. Isa pa, kung sa mga aquifer lang tayo nakasalalay, mas mapapabilis ang paglubog ng lupa\u2014na siya namang nagiging dahilan ng pagbaha.\r\nKasabay po ng mga dam para sa Metro Manila at mga karatig-bayan ang suporta natin sa mga tagalalawigan. Aprubado na rin ang Water District Development Sector Project, sa ilalim ng LWUA o Local Water Utilities Administration. [Palakpakan]\r\nSiguro po, narinig na rin ninyo ang pinakamalaki nating PPP project\u2014ang Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike\u2014bubuksan na rin ang bidding bago matapos ang 2014. [Palakpakan] Napakaraming benepisyong maidudulot nito. Una, mababawasan ang pagbaha. Ngayon po, \u2018pag pumalo ng 12.5 meters ang taas ng tubig sa lawa, tiyak, babahain na ang mga komunidad sa paligid nito. Ang solusyon: dikeng may taas na higit sa 15 metro. Ikalawa \u00a0pong pakinabang: Malilinis ang tubig sa Laguna Lake. Ang ikatlo po: Bawas ang trapiko. Sa ibabaw ng dike, magkakaroon ng expressway, na babagtas sa Los Ba\u00f1os hanggang Taguig. \u2018Pag natapos ang C-6 road na kokonekta sa San Jose del Monte, may isa na naman tayong paraan upang makatawid ng Kamaynilaan nang hindi na kakailanganing dumaan sa EDSA. [Palakpakan] Sa pakikituwang ng pribadong sektor, ang obligasyon natin dito ay right of way lang; porsyento ng lupang mare-reclaim ang ipapambayad sa mananalong bidder. Dahil dito, makukuha natin ang ating mga pangangailangan, habang mababawasan din ang ating gastusin.\r\nIlang halimbawa lang po iyan ng mga proyektong nakapila na para magdala ng benepisyo sa ating mga Boss. Marami pang iba: Aprubado na rin ng NEDA Board ang Laoag City Bypass Link Road Project; ang Cebu Bus Rapid Transit Project; at ang LRT Line 1 South Extension and Line 2 East Extension. Sa mga taga-Palawan naman: Maliban sa mga proyekto sa Puerto Princesa Airport, abangan na rin ninyo ang Busuanga Airport. Naka-go signal na rin po ang pagpapatayo ng phase one ng modernong Clark Green City sa Capas, Tarlac, pihado pong magsisilbing sentro ng komersyo at industriya, hindi lang sa Gitnang Luzon, kundi sa kalakhang bansa. [Palakpakan] Sa dulo po, ang ambisyon natin sa Clark Green City\u2014maging di-hamak itong mas malawak na Bonifacio Global City. Ang dating liblib, magiging hitik sa oportunidad.\r\nSa mabuting pamamahala, nanunumbalik ang tiwala ng merkado, ng mundo, at ng taumbayan sa ating gobyerno. Nagbubunsod ito ng isang siklo: Dahil nakikita ang resulta ng agenda ng reporma, nakikiambag ang bawat isa sa ating mga Boss. Talagang hindi nag-iisa ang gobyerno sa pagsusulong ng malawakan at makabuluhang reporma. Totoo nga po: Kayo ang aming lakas. [Palakpakan]\r\nKaya nga po, mga Boss: Salamat sa inyong tiwala at pakikiisa, na lalong nagiging mahalaga sa mga panahong sinalubong tayo ng sunud-sunod na trahedya.\r\nNoong Setyembre 2013, sinugod ng masasamang elemento ang Zamboanga: Ginawang human shield ang mga kababayan nating namumuhay nang mapayapa, at sinunog pa ang kanilang mga tahanan. Nasubukan ang galing ng ating unipormadong hanay. Pinakamasalimuot sa larangan ng bakbakan ang tinatawag na urban combat\u2014ngunit 195 ang nailigtas natin, sa 197 kataong naipit sa putukan. Saludo tayo sa ating mga kapatid sa unipormadong hanay: Nagtagumpay ang sambayanan dahil sa inyong sakripisyo. [Palakpakan]\r\nInatasan po natin si Secretary Singson na pangasiwaan ang rehabilitasyon ng imprastrukturang nasira sa Zamboanga. Pangunahin sa mga pangangailangan: mabigyan ng tahanan ang mga kababayan nating nasunugan. Ito po mismo ang isinasagawa natin sa ilalim ng Zamboanga City Roadmap to Recovery and Reconstruction. Pagpasok nga po ng Agosto, magsisimula nang lumipat ang mga apektadong pamilya sa mga permanenteng bahay sa Martha Drive Subdivision. Kabuuang 7,176 na kabahayan sa iba\u2019t ibang lugar ang target nating makumpleto sa Hunyo ng susunod na taon. Humihingi po kami ng pang-unawa. Maraming problemang kinailangan munang lutasin ukol sa pagkuha ng lupang lilipatan. Tinitiyak din nating ang mga tahanang ito ay sumasang-ayon sa pangangailangan ng kanilang relihiyon at kultura, kaya\u2019t hindi pangkaraniwan ang mga ito. Sa 1,661 pamilya namang gustong sila mismo ang magkumpuni ng sariling tahanan, 30,000 pisong halaga ng Home Materials Assistance ang ipinapamahagi na.\r\n3.5 billion pesos po ang nakahanda para sa pagpapaayos ng imprastruktura, pagbili ng mga lote, pagpapatayo ng mga permanenteng tahanan, at iba pang suporta sa Zamboanga. 2.57 billion pesos dito, nai-release na sa NHA at DPWH.\r\nIlang linggo naman po matapos ang krisis sa Zamboanga, niyanig ng lindol ang Central Visayas; pinakamalaki ang pinsala sa Bohol. Dito natin nakita ang maaaring maabot ng sambayanang nagkakaisa sa pagresponde sa sakuna. Isang linggo matapos ang lindol, may kuryente na sa Tagbilaran at sa lahat ng munisipalidad ng Bohol. [Palakpakan]\r\nNgayon nga po, bawat isa sa 25 na kritikal na tulay at kalsadang nasira ng lindol, nadadaanan na. May kabuuang 3.583 billion pesos nang nai-release para sa rehabilitasyon ng Bohol at Cebu. [Palakpakan] Kasama na rito ang 2.49 billion pesos na ipinagkaloob ng DILG sa lokal na gobyerno, para sa pagpapagawa ng mga palengke, civic center, tulay, water systems, munisipyo at ibang pang istrukturang pampamahalaan.\r\nBago naman po matapos ang 2013, dumating naman si Yolanda\u2014 ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa kasaysayan. 1.47 milyong pamilya ang talagang naapektuhan, at 44 sa ating 81 probinsya ang tinamaan. Sa Eastern Visayas, kung saan pinakamalakas ang pinsalang nadulot, napakaraming kinailangan na agarang lingap.\r\nSa sobrang lakas ng bagyo, naparalisa ang maraming LGU dahil sila mismo ang tinamaan. Natangay po pati ang ating prepositioned relief goods, kaya\u2019t talagang kinailangang manggaling sa ibang lugar ang tulong. Lalo pang naging mabigat ang pagdadala ng ayuda, dahil bagsak ang imprastruktura: Walang kuryente, hindi madaanan ang kalsada, at halos lahat ng truck at heavy equipment na kailangan ng ating first responders ay nasira sa pinakaapektadong mga lugar\r\nWala ring gasolina, at walang komunikasyon.\r\nKinailangan po talaga ng pambihirang pagkakaisa para ipaabot ang tulong sa mga apektadong pamilya, kalingahin ang mga naulila\u2019t sugatan, siguruhing walang mangyayaring outbreak ng sakit, at marami pang ibang tungkulin. Halimbawa lang po: Sa pagkain, hindi lang bigas at delata ang kinailangang intindihin. Kailangan din ng mga repacking center, ng maraming truck, pati na ang mga barkong magtatawid ng ayuda sa mga apektadong probinsya. Pagdating doon ng relief goods, kailangang malinis na ang kalsadang dadaanan, at mapagasolinahan ang mga truck nang makabalik sila sa pinanggalingan, upang muling makapagkarga ng ating mga food pack.\r\nHindi nagpatumpik-tumpik sa pagresponde ang inyong gobyerno. Nagmadali tayong linisin, unang-una, ang airport, kaya sa loob ng 24 oras pagkatapos ng bagyo, nakapasok na ang tatlo nating C130 na may dalang ayuda. Sa mismong araw ding iyon, nakapagtayo tayo ng communications hub para maging mas mabilis ang daloy ng impormasyon. Sa ikalawang araw, dumating na ang Rapid Health Assessment teams ng DOH; ang dagdag na sundalo, pulis, at BFP personnel mula sa ibang probinsya; pati na mga kawani ng DSWD na nanguna sa relief operations\u2014 sa distribution centers man sa Eastern Visayas, o sa maraming repacking centers na agad na nagbukas sa buong bansa.\r\nSa loob lang ng dalawang araw, napagana na ang Leyte water district; sa ikatlong araw naman, bumukas ang unang gasolinahan. Agad na nilinis ang pangunahing mga kalsada. Pagsapit ng ika-22 ng Nobyembre o dalawang linggo matapos ang bagyo, naipamahagi na ang ikaisang milyong food pack sa mga nasalanta; na-clear na ang 35,162 cubic meters ng debris sa mga kalsadang pagdadaanan nitong mga relief; at nalinis at nadaanan na ring muli\u00a0ang 3,426 kilometers ng National Roads\u2014kasalukuyan naman po nating kinukumpuni ang 108.8 kilometrong napinsalang daanan, tulay, approaches, at landslide-prone areas. Pagsapit nga po ng Pasko noong lumipas ang 2013, may kuryente na sa lahat ng munisipalidad na tinamaan ng sakuna. [Palakpakan]\r\nKumbaga nga po sa Emergency Room, ibinuhos ng estado ang lahat ng kanyang kapangyarihan upang agad na mai-stabilize ang pasyente. Nagpapasalamat tayo sa mga kasapi sa ating Gabinete, na talaga naman pong nanguna sa pagresponde sa mga apektadong komunidad. Sina Sec. Cesar Purisima at Sec. Joel Villanueva ng TESDA, na namuno sa logistics at nag-organisa sa mga repacking center, nagmistulan po silang dalawang warehouse operator. [Palakpakan] Si Sec. Greg Domingo ng DTI, naging head purchasing agent ng bansa, habang si Sec. Linda Baldoz naman ng DOLE ay minabuting maging call center operator para sa lahat ng gusto o nag-aalok ng tulong. [Palakpakan] Salamat din kina Sec. Jun Abaya ng DOTC, na naging dispatcher ng ating transportasyon; kay Sec. Dinky Soliman na talagang pinatunayan ang pagiging punong relief worker ng bansa; at kina Sec. Mar Roxas ng DILG at Sec. Volts Gazmin ng DND, na nagbigay ng marching orders sa ating unipormadong hanay mula sa frontline ng sakuna. [Palakpakan] Muli po, salamat sa ating Gabinete.\r\nTo our friends and neighbors around the world: Your outpouring of solidarity will never be forgotten by a grateful Filipino people. Again, on their behalf, we thank you. [Palakpakan]\r\nMarahil nga po, sa kahandaan nating makiambag sa abot ng ating makakaya, na siyang ipinapamalas ng ating OFWs, peacekeepers, at iba pang Pilipino sa labas ng bansa, nang tayo naman ang nangailangan, nakita ng mundong karapat-dapat din tayong tulungan. Salamat sa inyo, at sa lahat ng Pilipinong nag-alay ng dalangin at suporta, dito man o sa ibang panig ng mundo. \u00a0[Palakpakan]\r\nHindi po natigil ang trabaho natin. Nagsagawa tayo ng livelihood interventions, upang maging mas mabilis ang pagbangon ng mga nasalanta nating kababayan. Ngayong Hulyo nga po, 221,897 trabaho na ang nalikha matapos tayong magkaloob ng bangka, kagamitan sa pangingisda at pagtatanim, mga binhi, at livestock. Kasama na rin po dito ang mga sinuwelduhan nating naging kabahagi ng cash for work program.\r\nTanggap naman po siguro ng lahat na malaki ang problemang dala ni Yolanda. Pero ayon nga po sa international standards, kapag nangyari ang ganitong klaseng sakuna, isang taon ang inaabot bago matapos ang relief at mag-umpisa ang rehabilitasyon ng isang bansa. Pero sa loob lang ng walong buwan, idineklara na ng United Nations mismo na nasa yugto na tayo ng rehabilitation. Si Ginoong Yuri Afanasiev ng United Nations Development Programme na nga po ang nagsabi: \u201cWe have never seen a recovery happen so quickly. And many of us have been in many different disasters.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nMahabang panahon ang bubunuin para tuluyang makabangon sa mabibigat na sakuna. Sa Haiti, dalawang taon ang nakalipas mula ng lindol, marami pa rin ang nasa evacuation centers. Ang mga kapatid natin sa Indonesia, inabot ng walong taon para maka-recover sa tsunami sa Aceh. Mismong sa Amerika nga po, sinasabing walong taon ang inabot para makabalik sa dati matapos humagupit si Hurricane Katrina.\r\nHindi pa po tapos ang ating trabaho. Marami pang bahay na kailangang ipatayo; marami pang mga kababayan natin ang kailangang ibangong muli; patuloy pa rin ang pag-build back better para sa mga hinagupit ni Yolanda.\r\nKaya nga po: Ngayong Hulyo, isinumite na sa atin, at nilagdaan na rin natin, ang LGU Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan para sa Cebu, Iloilo, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, at Tacloban City. [Palakpakan] Pumasa po ito sa masusing pagsusuri ng mga cluster ng Gabinete; laman nito ang mga pangangailangan ng ating mga kababayan, ayon na rin sa isinasagawang malawakang post-disaster needs assessment. Nabuo po ang planong ito sa maigting na pagsisikap ni Secretary Ping Lacson, na inatasan nga nating tumutok sa mga hamong iniwan ni Yolanda. [Palakpakan] Umaasa po ako sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso, dahil malaking halaga ang kailangan, upang tuluyan nang maibangon ang ating mga kababayan.\r\nAlalahanin po natin: Nasa Diyos ang awa; nasa tao ang gawa. Ito rin ang parehong ideya sa likod ng ating mga hakbang para sa disaster preparedness. Binigyang-lakas natin ang mga LGU na siyang mga frontliner tuwing bagyo at \u00a0iba pang sakuna, gamit ang moderno at malawakang forecasting system.\r\nSa DREAM-LiDAR project sa ilalim ng Project NOAH, halimbawa, napapadali ang pagtukoy kung saan ang mga lugar na pinakababahain. Nakamapa na po ang 19 sa target nating 20 river systems para matukoy kung ano ang mga lugar na agad naaapektuhan tuwing bumubuhos ang ulan.\r\nDahil mas eksakto na ang pagtukoy natin kung kailan at saan tatama ang epekto ng bagyo, ngayon po, napapaaga ang paghahanda at pagbibigay-babala ng ating mga LGUs. Maaga na ring naililikas ang kanilang mamamayan. Kung ang maayos na forecasting, tatambalan pa natin ng mahusay na LGU, talaga naman pong maraming buhay ang maililigtas. Sa Albay na hinagupit kamakailan lang ng bagyong Glenda, walang naitalang pumanaw dahil sa bagyo, salamat sa mabuting pamamahala ni Governor Joey Salceda. [Palakpakan] At kung kaya itong gawin ng isang probinsya na siya ngang parang natawag na nga pong highway ng mga bagyo, bakit naman tayo magdududa na kakayanin ng iba pang hindi highway ng bagyo?\r\nPag-usapan naman natin ang seguridad. Mulat po tayo sa mga hamon sa bansa, at alam din nating mahal ang kailangan nating mga kagamitan. Ngayon po, ikinalulugod kong iulat sa inyo: Tuloy-tuloy ang modernisasyon ng AFP. Nakuha na natin ang brand new na 8 Sokol Combat Utility Helicopters, tatlong AgustaWestland-109 helicopters, at ang kauna-unahang landing craft utility ship na ginawa dito mismo sa ating bansa, ang BRP\r\n. Dumating na rin po ang apat na refurbished UH-1 helicopters at 2 navy cutters. Nito namang nakaraang Mayo, pinasinayaan na rin natin ang state-of-the-art Command Center ng Naval Forces West sa Palawan.\r\nSa susunod na taon, lalapag na ang 2 sa 12 na FA-50 lead-in fighter trainer jets na binili natin. [Palakpakan] Ang natitira naman po, inaasahan nating maide-deliver bago matapos ang 2017. Target din nating makuha ang karagdagang brand new na 8 Bell combat utility helicopters, 2 anti-submarine helicopters, 10 pang AgustaWestland-109 helicopters, 2 light-lift aircraft, 3 medium-lift aircraft, mga radar system at iba pang kagamitang magpapaunlad sa kakayahan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas. [Palakpakan] Samantala po, sa Setyembre ng taong ito, inaasahan ang pagdating ng karagdagang 17 refurbished UH-1 helicopters.\r\nDumating na rin ang paunang mga M4 assault rifles na binili natin para sa kasundaluhan. Sa mga susunod na buwan, ang kabuuang bilang ng baril na mapapasakamay ng ating mga kawal: 50,629 units ng M4. Ang bonus pa: dahil sa maayos na proseso ng procurement at tapat na pangangasiwa sa pondo, may savings tayo na mahigit 1.2 billion pesos; itong savings ay ipinambibili na natin ng mas marami pang baril. [Palakpakan]\r\nIdidiin ko lang po: Brand new at dekalidad ang lahat ng ripleng ito na nagmumula sa manufacturer na daang taon na pong gumagawa ng sandata. \u2018Di po ba noong araw: naubos na nga ang pondo, hindi pa alinsunod sa ispesipikasyong kailangan natin, tulad po ng biniling\u00a0Kevlar Helmets. Sabi po ng ispesipikasyon, dapat sa U.S. Pero noong ibinili, sa ibang bansa. May na-convict na po dahil dito. Pati ang isang hukom na diumano\u2019y sangkot dito, natapos na ang imbestigasyong inutos ng Korte Suprema, at hinihintay natin ang kanilang pasya.\r\nTuloy ang pagtugis natin sa kalaban ng estado at masasamang elemento para sa mga krimeng ginawa nila. Halimbawa nga po: Nahuli na ang Chairman at Secretary General ng NPA nitong Marso. Nanunumbalik na rin po ang normalidad at kaayusan sa 31 probinsyang dating ginambala ng NPA.\r\nNagbabago na rin nga po ang mukha ng ating kapulisan. Patunay po rito ang 30 pulis, sa pangunguna ni Inspector Charity Galvez, na tumalo sa tinatayang 250 NPA na sumugod sa kanilang presinto noong 2011. [Palakpakan] Nitong Marso naman po, 4 na bagitong pulis ang buong-tapang na sumagupa laban sa Martilyo Gang sa Mall of Asia. Mabuti nga po\u2019t naabot na ang 1:1 police to pistol ratio, kaya\u2019t naisyuhan na rin ng bagong baril ang ating mga rookie policewomen. Dati, nakakaligtaan ang kapulisan; ngayon, kinakalinga na sila ng estado, at talaga namang tinutumbasan nila ito ng wagas at masigasig na serbisyo. [Palakpakan]\r\nPakinggan po natin ang tinig magigiting nating pulis:\r\nPO1 Juliet Macababbad: May narinig po kaming, ano, nagbasag ng salamin. Naging alerto kami ng buddy ko.\r\nPO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Ah \u2018yong unang pumasok po ng isip ko \u2018yung bumunot na po ako ng baril kasi alam ko na ano po sila\u2014na ready po silang magpaputok sa amin; nakauniporme po kami.\r\nPO1 Maricel Rueco: Sinabi po ng aking ka-buddy na si PO1 Bantiyag na \u201cKo-cover-an kita, ikaw ang tumawag sa ating PCP [Police Community Precinct]!\u201d\r\nPO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Meron po kaming nahuli na isang miyembro po nila.\r\nPO1 Delia Langpawen: Pang-apat na araw namin ditong duty\u2014doon mismo sa post na \u2018yon. Tapos, biglang ganoon po ang nangyari.\r\nPO1 Juliet Macababbad: Kailangan po talaga may baril \u2018yung bawat pulis. Mabuti na lang po, may in-issue po sa amin na Glock 17 Generation 4 po.\r\nPO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Malaking tulong po \u2018yung baril sa amin kasi kapag nagpapatrolya ka may confidence ka na kahit may mangyari puwede kang maki-engage.\r\nPO1 Juliet Macababbad: Masarap po sa pakiramdam \u2018yung ikaw ay makatulong sa iyong mga kababayan. Kung ano po \u2018yung nagagawa ng mga lalaki, nagagawa din po naming mga babae. [Palakpakan]\r\nPO1 Delia Langpawen: Kahit kinabahan po kami dahil first encounter po namin, ang inisip po namin ay ang kapakanan ng mga tao na nandoon.\u201d\r\n\u2013 PO1 Juliet Macababbad, PO1 Marcelina Bantiyag, PO1 Maricel Rueco, and PO1 Delia Langpawen\u2014policewomen na umaresto sa miyembro ng\u00a0Martilyo Gang [\r\n]\r\nNito naman pong Hunyo, naging sunod-sunod ang high-profile na pamamaslang. Arestado na ang ilangmga sangkot sa pagpatay kina Mayor Ernesto Balolong, sa negosyanteng si Richard King, at may sinusundan na ring magandang lead ang ating kapulisan sa pagpatay sa race car driver na si Ferdinand Pastor. Huwag po kayong mag-alala: hahabulin natin ang hustisya sa kabuuan, hindi ang bahagi lamang. Kaya bukod sa mga ginawa nating pag-aresto, patuloy tayo sa paglikom ng ebidensya laban sa iba pang suspect. Pananagutin natin ang lahat ng may-sala. [Palakpakan]\r\nPinapaigting pa natin ang pangangalaga sa seguridad ng taumbayan. Simula ng ika-16 ng Hunyo ngayong taon, ipinapatupad natin sa National Capital Region ang Operation Lambat. Matapos nating gawing triple ang dami ng checkpoints at magsagawa ng iba\u2019t ibang operasyon, ang resulta: 862 sasakyan at 29 mga baril ang nakumpiska natin. Nakapag-serve tayo ng 587 warrants of arrest, na nagresulta sa pagkakaaresto ng 410 suspect. Ibinalik din natin ang Oplan Katok para matiyak na ang may tangan ng lisensyadong baril ay ang karapat-dapat lamang. 28,714 na bahay sa NCR ang kinatok ng mga pulis para sa operasyong ito.\r\nBago natin ipatupad ang Oplan Lambat, mula Enero hanggang ikalawang linggo ng Hunyo, ang murder at homicide sa National Capital Region, umaabot sa 31 kaso kada linggo. Sa limang linggo pa lang ng operasyon, ang murder at homicide rate: Bumaba sa 22 kaso na lamang kada linggo. 29 porsyentong pagbaba ang naitala\u2014katumbas ng 9 na pagpatay ang napigilan natin kada linggo. At sa NCR pa lang po ito. Kung maisasabatas natin ang pension reform, at makakakalap nga tayo ng sapat na pondo para sa dagdag na pulis at para matuloy ang planong pagbili ng kagamitan, lalong mapapalawak ni Sec. Mar Roxas ang Operation Lambat, upang gawing mas ligtas ang buong bansa. [Palakpakan] Nasa ilalim nga po sana ng DAP ang pondong pangkagamitan, pero dahil hindi ito na-obligate bago bumaba ang desisyon ng Korte Suprema, kailangan po nating maghanap ng pagkukunan ng karagdagang pondo.\r\nTunay nga po: Tiwala ang pundasyon ng mabuting pamamahala. Tiwalang maaasikaso ang lahat ng tinamaan o tatamaan ng bagyo; tiwalang sa bawat araw ng trabaho, ligtas mong mauuwian ang pamilya mo. Tiwala na hindi kayo lalamangan ng inyong mga pinuno; tiwalang nariyan ang inyong gobyerno, kakampi ninyo, lalo na kung kayo ang nadedehado. Tiwala na mananagot ang mga nang-abuso, at maitatama ang mga proseso at institusyong ginagamit para nakawan kayo. Tiwala na kung sumunod ka sa tama, makukuha mo kung ano ang dapat sa iyo. Ang pagbabalik ng tiwala ninyo: Iyan po ang ibig-sabihin ng reporma. [Palakpakan]\r\nHalimbawa po: Sa Customs, na talaga naman pong sinubok ang ating pasensya noong nakaraang mga taon. Naging malinaw sa atin: Reset button ang solusyon. Bumuo po tayo ng mga bagong tanggapan para suriin at gawing epektibo ang mga patakaran sa Customs. Nagtalaga tayo ng bagong commissioner, anim na bagong deputy commissioner, kasabay na rin ang 40 iba pang maaasahang indibidwal para ipatupad ang ating mga reporma sa Customs. Ibinalik din natin sa tamang posisyon ang mga empleyado. Totohanang ipinagbawal ang mga guwardiyang umaastang kahera, o warehouseman na ginagawang examiner.\r\nMarami nga po ang nagsasakripisyo para ayusin ang Customs. Kabilang dito ang mga kawani mula sa ibang departamento at ahensya ng gobyerno, na hiniling nating lumipat sa Customs dahil tiwala tayo sa kanilang integridad. Isipin po ninyo: Sino nga ba naman ang naghahanap ng sakit ng ulo, lalo pa\u2019t walang garantiya ng tagumpay? May mga ipinagpaliban ang kanilang promotion. May mga nagpahiwatig din ng agam-agam dahil sa takot na balikan sila ng mga sindikato. Pero sa huli, tumugon sila sa ating panawagang maglingkod. Marapat lang na personal kong pasalamatan ang lahat ng kawaning ito, sa pangunguna na nga ni Commissioner Sunny Sevilla. [Palakpakan]\r\nPinapatunayan po natin: Sa paninindigan at pagkakaisa, kayang linisin kahit pa ang isang institusyong napakahabang panahon nang dinungisan ng katiwalian. Patunay po rito ang good news na natanggap natin: Mula Enero hanggang Abril 2014, umangat ng 22 porsyento ang cash collections ng Customs kumpara sa parehong panahon noong nakalipas na taon. Ang kabuuan nilang koleksyon sa unang apat na buwan ng taon: 117 billion pesos. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng masasabi ko naman sa mga patuloy na rumaraket: Alam kong hindi na kayo tinatablan ng takot at kahihiyan. Nasa inyo kung makukunsensya kayo\u2014o maaawa kayo sa mga nalululong sa drogang pinapapasok o pinahihintulutan ninyong pumasok, o sa mga magsasakang napagkakaitan ng tamang kita. Ang sa akin lang: Kapag sumapat na ang nililikom na ebidensya laban sa inyo, sa Bilibid ang susunod ninyong destino. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung pag-uusapan natin ang mga repormang nagsisimula nang magbunsod ng malawakang kaunlaran, marapat din pong ibalita ko sa inyo ang mga pangyayari ukol sa repormang agraryo.\r\nAlam naman po natin, at malinaw sa batas: kailangan munang tukuyin ang maaari at hindi maaaring ipamahaging lupain. Pero ang masaklap, ipinamana sa atin ang bungi-bunging datos. Bakit \u2018ka niyo? Taong 1913 pa sinimulan ang Cadastral Survey ng ating bansa, na tutukoy ng hangganan ng mga lupaing saklaw ng bawat lungsod, bayan, at lalawigan sa Pilipinas.\r\nIsa pang problema: Inuna ng mga nakaraang administrasyon ang distribusyon ng mga lupaing madaling ipamahagi tulad ng mga government-owned land, at lupaing napagkasunduan na ng may-ari at magsasaka. Ang naiwan sa atin ay mga lupaing maraming kumplikasyon, at ugat pa ng mahabang debate at demandahan.\r\nDagdag din nga pong suliranin ang masalimuot na sitwasyon sa ARMM. Ang lupa ng ARMM ay tinatayang 1.5 milyong ektarya. Pero ang lupang nakatala na dinatnan natin, ngayon ay nasa 2.9 million hectares na dahil sa patung-patong na pag-angkin ng lupa. Nagtataka nga po si Governor Mujiv Hataman ng ARMM at tinanong niya sa akin minsan, \u201cBoss, paano kaya nanganganak ang lupa?\u201d\r\nWala po tayong balak na ipasa ang mga suliraning ito sa susunod sa atin, para pag-ugatan lang ng panibagong mga problema at ng lalong pagkaudlot ng repormang agraryo.\r\nSa 2015, makalipas ng 102 taon, matatapos na rin ang Cadastral Survey. [Palakpakan] Ngayong taon, ihahain din nating muli sa Kongreso ang panukalang batas para i-extend ang paghahain ng Notice of Coverage, na hindi agad natapos nang husto dahil nga sa mga problemang kinailangan muna nating solusyonan. [Palakpakan] Oras na maihain ang panukalang batas, umaasa tayong maipapasa ito sa lalong madaling panahon.\r\nKung tiwala nga po ang pag-uusapan, dapat ding isama ang Bangsamoro. Matapos ang mahabang panahon ng hidwaan at napupurnadang negosasyon, naibalik na natin ang tiwala. Pruweba ponito: Noong nakaraang Marso, nilagdaan na ang Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. [Palakpakan]\r\nPero simula pa lang ito ng ating pag-usad sa landas ng malawakang pag-unlad sa Mindanao. Wala pong nakakatangging napag-iwanan ang ARMM. Gusto po nating bigyan ng pantay na pagkakataon ang lahat ng Pilipino, kaya nga dapat may boost up, para naman maka-catch up ang ating mga kababayang nasa laylayan. Halimbawa, sa budget na iminumungkahi natin para sa 2015, 5.17 billion pesos mula sa budget ng DPWH ay nakalaan para sa imprastraktura ng ARMM. [Palakpakan]\r\nKasalukuyan na po nating pinapanday ang panukalang Bangsamoro Basic Law. Humihingi po tayo ng pang-unawa sa ating Kongreso ukol rito. Mahalaga pong maging masusi ang paghimay natin ng bawat probisyong ilalatag. Sa abot ng ating makakaya, isusulong natin ang isang panukalang batas na makatwiran, makatarungan, at katanggap-tanggap sa lahat. [Palakpakan]\r\nKung maisasabatas nga po ang Bangsamoro Basic Law bago matapos ang taon at maisasagawa ang kinakailangang plebesito, mabibigyan ng isa\u2019t kalahating taon ang Bangsamoro Transition Authority para ipakita ang positibong pagbabago. Kung maaantala naman ito, natural pong iikli rin ang panahon para mapatunayan na tama nga ang landas ng kapayapaang tinatahak natin.\r\nNapakarami na nga po nating nararating dahil sa tiwala\u2014at wala tayong balak basagin ang tiwalang ito. Ang gobyerno ninyo ngayon: mayroong isang salita. Hindi ko na po iisa-isahin ang mga natupad nating panata sa tuwid na daan; baka masabihan lang tayong nagbubuhat ng sariling bangko. Pero mahirap din namang hindi tayo magbanggit, dahil malamang nag-aabang na ang mga magsasabing wala tayong ginawa. Kaya samahan niyo na lang akong magbigay ng ilang halimbawa: Trabaho\u2019t pagkakataon para sa napakaraming Pilipino, nalikha at patuloy pang nililikha. Sa katunayan, mula Abril 2013 hanggang Abril 2014: nasa 1.65 million ang nadagdag sa bilang ng mga Pilipinong nagtatrabaho. [Palakpakan] Minanang kakulangan sa aklat, upuan, at silid-aralan, napuno na; habang ang mga panibagong pangangailangan dahil sa K to 12, pinupunuan na rin. 1:1 police-to-pistol ratio, meron na rin po. Modernisasyon ng Sandatahang Lakas, nangyayari na. Pangmatagalang kapayapaan sa Mindanao, sumusulong na. Pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya, tuloy-tuloy pa rin. [Palakpakan]\r\nSabay-sabay nating natutupad ang ating mga pangarap: kalusugang pangkalahatan, silid-aralan, trabaho, daungan, kalsada, paliparan, kaligtasan, kapayapaan. Ang nabawi nating pambansang dangal, sinamahan pa ng pagkilala ng mundo sa bagong anyo ng Pilipinas. Ang kaban ng bayang mula sa pawis ng mamamayan, ginugugol para lamang sa kanilang kapakanan.\r\nPakinggan po nating muli ang isa pa sa ating mga Boss:\r\nAko po si Gina Lastrado, 47 years old. Galing po ako sa Isla 1 Barangay 180, Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\nAng trabaho ko po doon sa may pinanggalingan namin sa Pasay, ako po \u2018yong businesswoman. Ngayon po, pinagpatuloy ko pa rin, ma\u2019am, \u2018yong pagtitinda ko. Kailangan po dito tiyaga. Ni-relocate po kami dahil sa aming lugar po ay nasasabing \u201cdanger zone.\u201d Karamihan po kasi nasa tabi ng ilog.\r\n\u2018Yung Ondoy, grabe po talaga. Sabi ko nga hindi mo aakalain na masasabi mong mabubuhay pa kami.\r\n\u201cKung ikukumpara \u2018yung buhay namin doon sa Pasay saka dito, umulan man, bumagyo kumbaga nakakatulog ka nang mahimbing. Wala kang pangamba na ayan na ang baha, hindi ka nakakatulog, \u2018di tulad doon sa pinanggalingan namin. Kaya nga sabi ko doon sa mga kasama ko, sa mga natira pa doon, lumipat na kayo kasi wala na kayong pangamba, wala na tayong baha.\u201d\r\n\u201cPagdating namin dito binigyan po kami ng grocery, saka binigay sa amin \u2018yung susi. Hinatid po kami dito sa bahay namin, at iyon pong eighteen thousand, \u2018yun ang panimula ng buhay namin dito. Binigyan niya kami ng dignidad ang lahat ng mga taga-squatter area doon sa lugar namin. Napakaganda ng buhay namin dito rin, ma\u2019am. Masasabi mong amin na talaga \u2018tong lugar na\u2019to.\u201d \u00a0[Palakpakan]\r\n\u2013 Gina Lastrado, relocated member of an informal-settler family (ISF)\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nNgayon nga po: Ang problemang dinatnan, nasolusyonan. Ang nandiyan, tinutugunan. At ang problemang parating pa lang, pinaghahandaan na rin. Naniniwala ako: Kung mananatili ang inyong tiwala, masosolusyonan natin ang mga ito.\r\nTingnan po natin ang sitwasyon sa enerhiya. Ginagawa na po natin ang lahat para siguruhing natutugunan ang lumalagong pangangailangan ng bansa. Sa kabila nito, meron pong mga pangyayaring talagang hindi natin inaasahan, na maaaring magbunsod ng problema sa susunod na taon. Halimbawa po: Kailangan nating bunuin ang mga kakulangan dahil sa outages para sa maintenance ng mga lumang planta, ng mga biglaang paghinto ng operasyon dahil sa pagkasira, at ng delay sa implementation o sa pagsasatayo ng mga bagong planta.\r\nHuwag po nating kalimutan, may banta din ng El Ni\u00f1o na makakaapekto sa kapasidad ng mga hydro powerplants, at magpapataas pa ng demand sa kuryente. Kung sa ating mga kabahayan nga, lalakas ang gamit natin ng electric fan o aircon dahil sa init ng panahon, lalo naman po sa mga industriya at negosyo. Hindi ito kasingsimple ng pagpunta sa tindahan at pagsabing, \u201cPabili nga po ng 600 megawatt generator, at paki-install na rin bukas.\u201d\r\nAng habol natin: kumpletong paghahanda para hindi tayo maparalisa sakaling mangyari ang worst-case scenario. Dapat, kahit sa susunod na taon pa uusbong ang problema, meron na tayong pinaplanong solusyon para dito. Kaya nga po inatasan ko si Secretary Icot Petilla ng DOE: Makipag-ugnayan ka na sa Joint Congressional Power Commission, sa Energy Regulatory Commission, sa industriya, at ang pinakaimportante, sa mga consumer, upang madagdagan ang kakayahan nating tugunan ang problema sa enerhiya.\r\nBatid ko rin po na apektado ang mga Boss natin sa pabugso-bugsong pagtaas ng presyo ng bigas. Mukhang totoo nga po ang mga ulat: May ilang mga halang ang bitukang hoarder na itinatago lang ang bigas, para kapag tumaas ang presyo, ibebenta nila ang stock para kumita nang di-makatwiran.\r\nHindi puwede ito. Kung sa tingin nila wais sila, mas mahusay ang ginagawang diskarte ng inyong gobyerno. Ang agarang solusyon: mag-import pa ng bigas, i-supply sa merkado, pababain ang presyo, at panatilihin ito sa risonableng antas, para malugi ang mga nagsasamantala sa Pilipino. [Palakpakan]\r\nNoong Nobyembre ng nakaraang taon, nagsimula na tayong mag-import ng 500,000 metriko tonelada para magsilbing ayuda sa supply na pinanipis ng nagdaang mga bagyo. Dumating na lahat ito nitong Marso. Nito ding Pebrero, inaprubahan ng NFA Council ang pag-angkat natin ng karagdagang 800,000 metriko tonelada bilang pagpuno sa ating buffer stock requirement, at 360,750 metric tons na nito ang dumating ngayong Hulyo; pagdating ng Setyembre, makakarating na ang kabuuan. Naaprubahan na rin ngayong Hulyo ang agarang importasyon ng 500,000 metriko tonelada ng bigas sa pamamagitan ng open bidding. May standby authority rin ang NFA na mag-angkat ng karagdagan pang 500,000 metriko tonelada, bilang paghahanda sa magiging epekto ng kalamidad sa ani at sa presyo ng bigas.\r\nKapag dumating ang karagdagan nating inaangkat, mapupuwersa na ngayong magbenta ang mga hoarder ng bigas na nakatago sa kanilang mga kamalig. Sa mga hoarder na ito: Kung gusto ninyong makipagmatigasan, okay lang, subukan ninyo ang estado. Tandaan lang ninyo: Anim na buwan lang ang itatagal bago mabulok ang stock sa mga warehouse ninyo. Siguradong malulugi kayo kapag nalunod na ang merkado sa dagdag na bigas. Kumikilos kayo kontra sa mga Pilipino; kami naman, isinusulong ang interes ng bawat Pilipino. Tingnan natin kung sino ang mananalo. [Palakpakan]\r\nBukod po sa pag-iimbestiga sa mga diumano\u2019y nagtago ng NFA rice, sinisiyasat na rin natin ang lahat ng mga puwedeng nagkuntsabahan sa mga ahensya. Iniimbestigahan na ang mga empleyadong pinagdududahan upang makasuhan at mapakulong ang mga may-sala sa lalong madaling panahon.\r\nSabay ng pagtugis sa mga mapang-abuso, patuloy rin ang mga proyekto natin para alagaan ang mga nasa sektor ng agrikultura. Ginagawa nating kaakit-akit na kabuhayan ang pagtatanim ng palay. Alam naman po natin na tumatanda na ang ating mga magsasaka, kaya malaki ang maitutulong sa food security kung mahihikayat natin ang mga kabataan na pasukin ang ganitong hanapbuhay.\r\nNagkakaloob po tayo ng mga makabagong kagamitan sa pagsasaka para sa episyenteng pagtatanim at pag-aani. Mula 2011 hanggang Mayo ng 2014, naipamahagi na natin ang kabuuang 4,628 production machineries, 11,362 post-production machineries, at 105 rice mills sa iba\u2019t ibang farmer\u2019s associations. Sa tulong po nito, nabawasan ang nasasayang sa ani ng ating mga magsasaka. Bukod rito, pinapaunlad natin ang mga patubig, nagpapagawa tayo ng farm-to-market roads, at nagsusulong ng training programs upang masagad ang kanilang kita.\r\nPag-usapan naman po natin ang budget. Ang Ehekutibo, nagmumungkahi ng mga proyekto at programa; inaaprubahan naman ito ng Kongreso. Kailangan nga lang po nating itigil ang ilan, para makasiguradong sumusunod tayo sa naging desisyon ng Korte Suprema ukol sa Disbursement Acceleration Program o DAP. Alam ko pong kaisa kayong mga nasa bulwagang ito sa paniniwalang hindi dapat ipagkait ang benepisyo sa ating mamamayan, at dapat nga itong makarating sa kanila sa lalong madaling panahon.\r\nKaya nga po: Ipinapanukala namin ang pagpasa ng supplemental budget para sa 2014, upang hindi naman maantala ang ating mga programa at proyekto. [Palakpakan] Kasabay po nito, nananawagan din tayo sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso, upang maipasa ang isang Joint Resolution na maglilinaw sa mga depinisyon at kaisipang tila pinagtatalunan pa\u2014at iba pang mga usaping kayo lang sa lehislatura, bilang mga nagsulat ng batas, ang makakapaglinaw. [Palakpakan]\r\nSa unang araw po ng trabaho matapos ang SONA, ihahain natin sa Kongreso ang panukalang 2.606 trillion pesos na 2015 National Budget. Gaya ng lagi, binuo ito kasama ang mamamayan, gamit ang istratehiyang naglalaan ng pondo kung saan lamang ito tunay na maghahatid ng benepisyo. Umaasa po tayo sa pakikiisa ng ating mga mambabatas na pagtibayin ito, bilang pangunahing instrumento sa paglikha ng pagkakataon para sa sambayanang Pilipino.\r\nPakinggan naman po natin ngayon ang isang benepisyaryo ng Alternative Learning System program po ng DepEd.\r\nAko po si Maria Cecilla Fruelda.\u201d\r\n\u201cBale nabalitaan ko po sa mga kasamahan kong taga-Zambales din po, na naririto na sa Rosario, na maganda daw po ang hanapbuhay dito sa Puting Kahoy kaya kami po ay napalipat dito.\u201d\r\n\u201cPrayoridad nga po naming mga tribo ang maghanap ng pagkain kaysa pong pagtuunan ng pansin ang pag-aaral. Sobra pong mahalaga sa akin ang pag-aaral lalo na po\u2019t noong nakapasa ako ng ALS [Alternative Learning System] dahil kung saan ito na po ang naging simula na matupad ko iyong aking pangarap na maging isang titser.\u201d\r\n\u201cSa tingin ko po, gaganda ang buhay ng mga kabataang Aeta sa amin kapag nakapag-aral. Hindi po ako nakapasok sa ALS kung saan ay \u2018di ko po malalaman iyong mga karapatan namin bilang katutubo at hindi rin po namin maipapaglaban ang aming tinatawag na lupaing-ninuno na ngayon po sa awa ng Diyos ay nilalakad na po ng NCIP para matituluhan ang lupa at mai-award na sa amin.\u201d\r\n\u201c\u2018Pag ako po ay nakatapos ng kursong Edukasyon, gusto ko po makapagturo sa aming komunidad at gusto ko rin pong maipamahagi kung ano man iyong mga nalalaman ko at higit na kaalaman na dapat ibigay sa mga katutubong Aeta.\u201d\r\n\u201cNapakalaki po ng naitulong ng ALS dahil bukod po nga sa ngayon po ako po\u2019y estudyante ng Luansing, kung saan po\u2019y mas lalo pang nakilala iyong aming komunidad. Marami pa po ang tumulong lalo na po iyong mga kabataan namin, kung saan parang sinundan nila ang yapak ko, mas higit na pong marami ang nag-aaral ngayon kaysa dati.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\n\u2013 Maria Cecilla Fruelda, Aeta tribal leader, ALS learner, and college student\u00a0[\r\n]\r\nMga kababayan, siya po, at ang marami pang benepisyaryong tulad niya, ang natatabunan sa tuwing umiingay ang orkestra ng negatibismo sa balita. Itong maiingay na ito, sadyang isinasara ang isip at namumuhay sa sariling mundo at realidad. Habang nakikita ang pagbabago sa lipunan, nangyayari na nga ang ating inasahan: lalong dumadalas, lalong umiinit, at lalong tumitindi ang pag-atake nila sa atin. Habang lumilinaw ang benepisyo ng reporma, pahirap nang pahirap ang pag-asang magtagumpay ang panlilinlang nila, kaya\u2019t nagtatanim sila ng duda. Desperado na po sila.\r\nBakit nga po ba sila galit na galit? Tingnan po natin ang kanilang motibasyon. Para sa mga ginawa nang negosyo ang kanilang posisyon: kung maayos natin ang mga sistema, nawawalan sila ng pagkakataong mansamantala. Natural lang na kontrahin nila tayo. Ito namang mga walang ibang layunin kundi ibagsak ang gobyerno: Puwede lang madagdagan ang kanilang hanay kung maraming nagdurusa, at nawalan ng tiwala sa sistema. Ngayong nakukumpuni na ang sistema at natutugunan ang pagdurusa, nababawasan na ang puwede nilang i-recruit, kaya pakaunti nang pakaunti ang kanilang bilang. Natural lang din na kontrahin nila tayo. Ang pinakamaingay na kumokontra sa atin ay ang ayaw ng transpormasyon, dahil nagsamantala at nakinabang sila sa lumang kalakaran.\r\nGanito ko nga po naiisip ang ating sitwasyon: Para tayong mga mamamayang matagal na naipit sa isang isla kung saan may nag-iisang tindahan. Dahil walang pagpipilian, nagpapataas sila ng presyo kung kailan nila gusto, at talaga nga naman pong inaabuso tayo. Inatasan po ninyo akong itimon ang bangka ng estado tungo sa kabilang isla, kung saan mas maraming tindahan, mas maraming pagpipilian, mas maayos ang buhay, at mas malawak ang pagkakataon. Siyempre po, ang nagpapatakbo ng tindahan sa ating islang nilisan, ayaw tayong pumalaot, dahil mawawalan sila ng inaabuso. Lahat, gagawin nila para pigilan ang ating pagtawid sa kabilang pampang. Sasabihin nilang: Pareho lang naman doon; wala naman talagang pagbabago doon. Itatali nila tayo sa daungan, bubutasan ang ating bangka, makikipagkuntsabahan para iligaw ang ating biyahe.\r\nAng totoo po, hindi naman ako ang kinokontra ng mga ito, kundi ang taumbayang nakikinabang sa tuwid na daan. Kontra sila sa magsasaka sa Iloilo, na mahigit limampung taong nangarap ng maayos na irigasyon, at ngayon ay nakikita nang ginagawa ang Jalaur Multi-purpose River Project. [Palakpakan] Kontra sila sa napakaraming estudyanteng hindi na kailangang magsiksikan sa mga classroom. Kontra sila sa nagkatrabaho dahil nasanay ng TESDA; kontra sa mga maagang naililikas sa panahon ng bagyo dahil sa pinahusay na PAGASA; kontra sa mga informal settler na nailayo sa panganib dahil sa programang pabahay; kontra sa mga maralitang libre nang nakakapagpagamot sa pampublikong ospital; kontra sa mga sundalong may modernong kagamitan kaya mas may kumpiyansa nang ipagtanggol ang bansa; kontra sa mga Moro at katutubong abot-tanaw na ang kapayapaan. Mga Boss, kontra po sila sa inyo. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng totoo po niyan, wala pa tayo sa puwesto, inaatake na tayo. Sanay na tayong sinasalubong ng negatibong komentarista sa almusal, pang-aalipusta sa tanghalian, insulto sa hapunan, at may intriga pa bilang midnight snack. [Tawanan] Ngayon nga pong Pangulo ako, tuloy pa rin ang mga kontra sa pagbabago. Sa tingin ko, maski sa pagbaba ko sa puwesto, hindi pa rin sila titigil.\r\nNaalala ko po ang isang matandang babaeng nakausap ko dati sa kampanya. Ang sabi niya sa akin, \u201cNoy, mag-iingat ka. Marami kang makakabangga.\u201d Totoo ang kanyang babala. Pero buo ang loob kong kaharapin ang mga nakakabanggang ito, dahil alam ko: iilan lamang sila, at di-hamak na napakarami natin. [Palakpakan] Mas malakas po tayong mga handang makisagwan tungo sa pagbabago. Magtatagumpay tayo sa labang ito, dahil tayo ang nasa tama.Nangarap tayo, nagsimula tayo, nagsikap tayo, nakabuwelo tayo, at ngayon, umaarangkada na nga po ang Pilipino. [Palakpakan] Lalong magiging sulit ang pagod at sakripisyo natin kung itong nasimulan natin ay itutuloy po ninyo.\r\nKayo ang haharap sa sangandaan; kayo ang magpapasya kung magtutuloy ang pagbabago. Tandaan lang po natin, ito ang aking ikalimang SONA; isa na lamang ang natitira. Sa 2016, pipili kayo ng bagong pinuno ng ating bayan. Ang sa akin lang po: Para ipagpatuloy at mas mapabilis pa ang pagbabagong tinatamasa na ng ating lipunan, iisa lang ang batayan sa pagpili ng papalit sa akin: Sino ang wala ni katiting na dudang magpapatuloy sa transpormasyong ating isinakatuparan? [Palakpakan]\r\nKayo po ang Boss, kayo ang lakas, kayo ang gumagawa ng pagbabago\u2014kaya kayo rin ang magpapatuloy nito. Nasasainyo kung paanong isusulat sa kasaysayan ang mga panahong ito. Maaari itong maalala bilang tuktok ng ating tagumpay, bilang magandang simulaing nasayang lang. Pero mas maganda pong di-hamak kung maalala ang mga nagawa natin bilang simula pa lang ng ating mahabang paglalakbay tungo sa katuparan ng mas matatayog pang pangarap.\r\nNoong minungkahi po ng ilang mga grupo na ako\u2019y tumakbo, ang sabi nila sa akin, hindi namin inaasahan na lutasin mo lahat ng problema ng ating bansa sa loob ng anim na taon. Pero simulan mo na sana. Nakita naman ninyo kung saan tayo nanggaling, at nakita naman ninyong lampas-lampas pa sa ating mga pinangarap noong simula ang tinatamasa natin ngayon.\r\nPinapanday na natin ang sistema kung saan talagang patas ang laban; kung saan ang sumusunod sa patakaran ay nakakarating sa nais niyang paroonan; kung saan may tunay na kumpetisyong nagbubukal ng pagkakataon at malawakang kaunlaran; kung saan ang lahat ay may kakahayang panghawakan ang sariling kapalaran. [Palakpakan]\r\nAbot-kamay na ang isang lipunang kayang sumalo, umaruga sa mga nasa laylayan; kung saan ang bawat isa ay kumikilala sa kanyang tungkulin sa kapwa at sa bayan; kung saan tuloy-tuloy at walang hanggan ang pakikiambag at sama-samang pag-angat ng sambayanan.\r\nPapalapit na po talaga tayo sa minimithi nating kinabukasan, kung saan naghahari ang katarungan, at tunay pong walang maiiwan.\r\nIto ang resulta ng reporma, at ito ang ipinaglalaban natin, at patuloy pang ipinaglalaban: Hindi ang pagpapanatili ng nakasanayan, kundi ang pagbabago ng sistema para makinabang ang lahat. [Palakpakan]\r\nMga Boss: Binigyan ninyo ako ng pagkakataong pamunuan ang transpormasyon. Kung hinindian ko ang hamon na iniharap niyo sa akin, para ko na ring sinabi na tutulong akong pahabain ang inyong pagdurusa, at hindi maaatim ng konsensya ko iyon. Kung tinalikuran ko ang pagkakataon, parang tinalikuran ko na rin ang aking ama\u2019t ina, at ang lahat ng inialay nila para sa atin; hindi po po mangyayari iyon. Sa paghakbang sa tuwid na daan, pinili ninyo ang mabuti at ang tama; tumotoo kayo sa akin\u2014at ako naman po ay tumototoo sa inyo. [Palakpakan]\r\nAng transpormasyong tinatamasa natin ngayon, ay magagawa nating permanente sa gabay ng Panginoon. Hangga\u2019t buo ang ating pananalig at tiwala, at hangga\u2019t nagsisilbi tayong lakas ng isa\u2019t isa, patuloy nating mapapatunayan na, \u201cthe Filipino is worth dying for\u201d [Palakpakan], \u201cthe Filipino is worth living for,\u201d at idadagdag ko naman po: \u201cThe Filipino is definitely worth fighting for.\u201d [Palakpakan]\r\nAlam po ni Vice President na noong 1987 magkasama kami. May kudeta, na-ambush po tayo doon, at tapos noon eh pangalawang buhay ko na po ito. Hindi natin maiiwasan mag-isip sa mga binubunggo natin, may araw kayang \u2018pag sasampa ka sa entablado, may trabaho ring araw\u2013may magtatagumpay bang maglagay ng bomba? Magtatagumpay ba \u2018yung mga maiitim na balak ng atin pong mga katunggaling gusto tayong ibalik sa maling kalakaran? At kung dumating nga ang panahong pong iyon, at natapos na po ang ating pangalawang buhay, masasabi ko ho bang, okay na rin? At sasabihin ko po sa inyo, mata sa mata, sa lahat po ng inabot natin, ako po\u2019y masasabing kontento na ako. [Palakpakan]\r\nKontento na po ako dahil panatag ang kalooban ko, na kung ako po\u2019y mawala na dito, marami po ang magpapatuloy ng ating tinahak na. Baka iyon lang po talaga ang papel ko\u2013umpisahan ito.\r\nNandiyan po ang mga taong tulad ni Cardinal Chito Tagle, at Ka Eduardo Manalo, at tulad ni Brother Eddie Villanueva, Father Catalino Arevalo, at Father Jett Villarin, at ni Bishop Jonel Milan, at si Sister Agnes Guillen, and Mae Salvatierra. Sila po sa sektor relihiyoso, tuloy, itutuloy nila ang ating pong sinimulan. [Palakpakan]\r\nMeron pong Aris Alip ng CARD na magtutuloy sa kanyang ambag sa pamamagitan ng microfinance. Nandiyan po ang isang Alice Murphy at ang kanyang mga kasamahan sa urban poor associates na talagang tutuluyan ang pangangalaga sa atin pong informal settlers. [Palakpakan]\r\nNandiyan po ang ating mga sundalo at kapulisan\u2013talagang araw-araw naman pong pinipililt gawin ang tama, tulad ng ating bagong Chief of Staff, ating mga Service Commanders, mga sundalo ng Light Reaction Battalion, at ng JSOG.\r\nNandiyan rin po, siyempre, hanay niyong pinanggalingan kong mga pulitiko. May duda ba na dadalhin tayo ni Senate President Franklin Drilon at Speaker Belmonte sa tamang landas? [Palakpakan]\r\nNaging pribilehiyo ko rin ho makipagtrabaho at makipag-ugnayan sa isang governor, Alfredo Mara\u00f1on ng Negros Occidental [palakpakan]. Hindi ko kapartido, pero palagay ko naman po kasama na niya ako sa fans club sa tama niyang pamamalakad sa Negros.\r\nMayroon rin tayong mga umaangat na bagong o mas bata sa aking pulitiko. Ayoko naman ho sabihin na napakaluma ko nang pulitiko sa pagtukoy sa mga mas bata.\r\nMga taong tulad ni Mayor Jed Mabilog at ni Mayor Len Alonte [palakpakan].\r\nMeron naman sa sektor, sabihin na nating mga culture tulad nina Noel Cabangon at ni Ogie Alcasid na hindi pansarili lang ang iniintindi. [Palakpakan]\r\nGabi-gabi po, bago ako matulog, thank you at nakalampas pa ako ng isang araw. Kung, sabi nga noong bata kami, \u201cfinish or not finish, pass your paper\u201d eh dumating na sa akin, palagay ko naman, naramdaman na ninyo kung anong pagbabagong karapatan ng bawat Pilipinong mangyari. At bahala na kayong ituloy ito. [Palakpakan]\r\nMga Boss, kayo ang gumawa ng transpormasyong ating tinatamasa. Kayo ang susi ng pagpapatuloy ng lahat ng positibong pagbabagong naabot natin. Buong-buo ang tiwala ko, nasa eksena man ako o wala, tutungo ang Pilipino sa tama niyang kalalagyan.\r\nKaya, hanggang dito na lang po ako. Magandang hapon po sa lahat. Maraming salamat sa inyo.

{"delivered": "2001-07-23 13:50:38+00:00", "author": "Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 2001]\r\nHis Excellency President Ramos; Senate President Drilon and the other Senators; Speaker de Venecia and the other congressmen and congresswomen; the Justices of the Supreme Court; the members of the diplomatic corps; mga maralitang tagalungsod na nanonood ngayon sa video wall at sa TV; mga maraming nakikinig sa radyo; mahal kong kababayan:\r\nKamakailan, may sumulat sa aking tatlong batang taga-Payatas, sina Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Ginawa nilang paper boats ang liham at pinalutang sa Pasig river patungo sa Malaca\u00f1ang.\r\nIto ang sinulat ng sampung taong gulang na si Jomar Pabalan: \u201cSana po ay mabigyan ng permanenteng trabaho ang tatay ko para hindi siya mahirapan.\u201d\r\nSabi naman ni Jason Vann Banogan, 10 taong gulang: \u201cSana po matulungan ninyo ako na makatapos sa pag-aaral ko hanggang kolehiyo, kasi po ang nagpapaaral sa akin ay ang lola ko lamang.\u201d\r\nAt ang tanging nais ni Erwin Dolera, walong taong gulang: ipasara ang Payatas dumpsite, at bigyan ng lupa ang kanyang pamilya.\r\nNapakalinaw, napakasimple ang hiling ng mga anak ng Payatas: Trabaho. Edukasyon. Sariling tahanan. Idagdag na rin: pagkain sa bawat mesa. Ito ang mithiin ng masa.\r\nAnd this, in common sense and plain talk, is the core of my vision.\r\nA vision for the future must be rooted in the past.\r\nA revolution gave birth to the first republic in Asia.\r\nA sense of nationhood was born but also the dream of a better life for all Filipinos. Andres Bonifacio, the poor man, the great plebeian who started this revolution, nurtured this dream.\r\nIn 1963, another poor man rose. He rose to the most powerful position in the land and risked everything to fulfill the poor man\u2019s dream.\r\nInspired by the great plebeian, my father, President Diosdado Macapagal, promulgated the Land Reform Law to emancipate the peasant from a feudal bondage to the soil.\r\nIn 1986 Filipinos peacefully reclaimed their civil liberties in the people power revolution. Under the leadership of Corazon Aquino, we reaffirmed our commitment to freedom and democracy on a mere stretch of highway\u2014with hardly a drop of blood shed or a shot fired in anger.\r\nSix months ago, on that same highway, people rose up to restore morality as the first institution of society and as the animating principle of justice and the rule of law.\r\nThus, we see, the historic pillars of a national vision: prosperity, freedom, justice.\r\nIto ang mga layuning ipinaglaban ng bayan mula nang ito\u2019y isilang: kasaganaan, kalayaan, katarungan.\r\nWe also see in our great history a progressive advancement towards the ultimate goal to transfer power over the state from the traditional economic and political bosses to the people.\r\nLast May 1, the poor raised their voices in anger and their fists in fury. Imprisoned in poverty, shackled to shame, denied justice in society, they personally delivered the message that, 100 years after they revolted to establish this nation, they had yet to partake of the national dream.\r\nDinig na dinig ko ang pahayag nila, at napakumbaba ako. Hindi ba\u2019t nasa balikat ko ang tungkuling mamuno sa pakikibaka laban sa salot ng kahirapan? Ako na siyang anak ng tinawag na \u201cpoor boy from Lubao\u201d?\r\nI take this duty upon my shoulders.\r\nI do so without fear or foreboding of failure.\r\nFor I know that the greatest obstacle we as a nation must overcome is inside us. The enemy to beat is ourselves: when we spread division rather than unity; when we put ourselves above country and profit above fairness; when we think the worst of those with whom we should be working for the common good, and when we wallow in despair rather than rise to achievement\u2013indeed, when we make politics replace patriotism in our country\u2019s hour of need.\r\nLet us, here in the home of democracy, therefore resolve, to grab hold of this enemy within, and beat him.\r\nThe internal enemy engaged, the battle will not be easy. We inherited very difficult problems.\r\nFrom 2.5 million jobless four years ago, unemployment now stands at 4 million. From a budget surplus in 1997 under President Ramos of more than a billion pesos, my government inherited a deficit exceeding 140 billion pesos. In the same period, poverty incidence rose from 36.8 percent of the population in 1997 to 40 percent in the year 2004.\r\nAnd, unlike the situation in 1997 when a battered Asia could still lean on the strength of the advanced economies, today our main trading partners like Japan and America are slowing down as well.\r\nBut we will prevail. We will prevail because the mainstream of our nation is united.\r\nIn the May elections, this administration received a solid mandate to carry on with the business of governance and reform.\r\nI do not view this mandate as a choice between personalities of this administration and those of the opposition.\r\nI see it rather as a vote for all of us\u2014administration and opposition\u2014to roll up our sleeves, stop looking back, and move forward, most especially in the fight against mass poverty.\r\nHinalal tayo upang labanan ang kahirapan, hindi ang isa\u2019t isa.\r\nOur challenge is clear: Sugpuin ang kahirapan.\r\nIn this spirit, I appeal to everyone here today to undertake something unconventional but much to be desired in these especially hard times.\r\nFrom today, let us set aside bickering and politicking for at least one year. We may congratulate ourselves on our forbearance at the next State of the Nation Address.\r\nSa halip ng alitan, isang taon tayong magtulungan sa ikabubuti ng taong bayan.\r\nThis is our duty. This is our mandate. This is our mission.\r\nUnity for the country\u2019s recovery will set the stage for national mobilization needed to undertake the great and difficult tasks ahead.\r\nWhat are these tasks?\r\nWhen I became president last January, I told the people about my vision of winning the war against poverty within the decade.\r\nTo succeed, the template of our national agenda must revolve around four components\u2014apat na elemento ng pakikibaka sa kahirapan.\r\nThe first is an economic philosophy of free enterprise appropriate to the 21st century. Pagnenegosyo upang dumami ang trabaho. Not a pitiless free-for-all but free enterprise with a social conscience.\r\nThe second component is a modernized agricultural sector founded on social equity. Palalaguin ang kita at ani ng maralitang tagabukid.\r\nThe third component is a social bias toward the disadvantaged to balance our economic development plan. Pagkalinga sa mga bahagi ng lipunan na naiiwanan ng kaunlaran.\r\nAnd the fourth component is to raise the moral standards of government and society. Moralidad sa gobyerno at lipunan bilang saligan ng tunay na kaunlaran.\r\nPagnenegosyo, pagpapaunlad ng agrikultura, kalinga sa nagigipit na sektor, at moralidad sa gobyerno at lipunan\u2014ito ang mga sandata natin sa digmaang-bayan laban sa kahirapan.\r\nI have therefore organized my interpretation of the state of the nation along these four components of our national antipoverty ideology.\r\nThe first is an economic philosophy for the 21st century. Under this philosophy, the way to fight poverty is to create jobs, not destroy them.\r\nTo create jobs, we will attract investments. To attract investments, we will attend to macro measures and concerns.\r\nIn addressing macro concerns, we will focus on long-term structural issues. We started with the reform of the power sector, and I congratulate those of you who are here and who were in the previous congress for this accomplishment. Now, we will turn to other basics like infrastructure, productivity, and the savings rate.\r\nIn focusing on infrastructure, we will harness the private sector via the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Our priorities include telecommunications facilities for high-speed productivity at low cost, roads to target tourist destinations, infrastructure for the modernization of agriculture, mass transport infrastructure for Metro Manila, and commuter and transport systems to disperse communities towards Subic-Clark and CALABARZON.\r\nWe will minimize bottlenecks to productivity, such as the high cost of power, deterrents to investments in agriculture, overly confrontational labor-management relations, and corruption and red tape at the national and local government levels.\r\nTo reduce the cost of power, we will begin implementing the Power Sector Reform Law which the previous Congress just passed.\r\nTo reduce deterrents to investments in agriculture, I ask Congress to enact a law making farmland acceptable as loan collateral.\r\nTo reduce excessive friction in labor and management relations, we will go the extra mile to work for industrial peace, and to work with labor and business to retrain workers for the fast-changing technologies of the new economy.\r\nTo reduce corruption in the Executive Branch, Cabinet Secretaries will have to deliver tangible results within 12 months in fighting graft. Our new e-Procurement Program will save billions and minimize anomalies. And I gave the reinforced Presidential Anti-Graft Commission added teeth to investigate and prosecute moto propio corruption in high places. And we will make the BIR and Customs showcases in this fight against graft and corruption.\r\nTo reduce corruption among elective officials, we will help honest people get elected by financing the full computerization of elections. We have released 2 billion pesos of the 3.4 needed for computerization. I ask congress to add another 500 million in the 2002 budget. Let us make the polls of May 14, 2001 the last national elections that use primitive methods of voter identification and ballot tabulation.\r\nTo reduce red tape in the national government, within 12 months, all government agencies will implement measures to cut in half the number of signatures required for their service. Housing permits shall only need 45 approvals, instead of 188. If legislation is required to effect this efficiency, the agencies concerned will draft appropriate bills for my endorsement to Congress.\r\nI congratulate the LTO for issuing licenses in half an hour. I congratulate the NBI for issuing clearances in one day.\r\nI ask our local governments likewise to streamline their operations and slash red tape. There must be continuity between national and local governments in their efforts to be investor-friendly.\r\nWe will address issues related to the savings rate, so that the cost of domestic capital can be reduced. These issues are tied up with the strength of the financial and fiscal sectors.\r\nWith regard to the financial sector, I ask Congress to amend the BSP charter and the Banking Act to improve supervision and promote financial prudence. These amendments should take us out of the money laundering list.\r\nWe adhere to a freely convertible peso and market exchange rates. However, we support the Central Bank\u2019s measures to curb speculation.\r\nTo those speculating against the peso, I only have this to say: Have you no pity for the common people, have you no love for your country? Makunsyensya naman kayo.\r\nInstead of speculating, let us further strengthen the financial sector. We will design innovative policies to develop our capital market. We will set up a secondary housing mortgage market, an asset management company, and a provident fund for overseas Filipinos. We will simplify and clarify the system of incentives. We will interpret investment laws in favor of the investor.\r\nAnd I ask Congress to enact laws on capital market reform such as the Personal Equity Retirement Act, the Investment Company Act, the Securitization Act, and amendments to the Securities Regulation Code.\r\nWith regard to the fiscal sector, we will control the budget deficit by collecting taxes vigorously and spending money prudently. For the longer term, I ask Congress to enact a law providing for a gross income tax.\r\nAlisin na natin ang mga tax deduction na nagiging sanhi lamang ng katakut-takot na corruption.\r\nThe strength of the financial and fiscal sectors partly lies in how we use the realities in the global and regional environment to our benefit. Thus, we will enhance our relations with the United States, whose economic and military power continues to make it important as a factor in the affairs of the region and in the nation. We will also strengthen bilateral economic and political relations with Japan, our biggest source of development assistance and a major trading partner. And more and more, we will design foreign policy and foreign trade policy in the context of ASEAN. And I ask Congress to enact a law giving overseas Filipinos, who continue to play a critical role in the country\u2019s economic and social stability, the right to vote.\r\nPreparing our growth sectors of the future enables us to tap the opportunities of the 21st century.\r\nWe will promote fast-growing industries where high-value jobs are most plentiful. One of them is information and communications technology, or ICT. Our English literacy, our aptitude, and skills give us a competitive edge in ICT. Filipino workers are ranked number one in the field, number one among knowledge workers. And analysts point to two developing countries as the likely world centers for software development and data management in this decade: India and the Philippines. We will live up to that forecast.\r\nAs a first step, let us declare that technology is the foundation of future economic development, as China did in 1998. ICT will jumpstart our old stalling economy and make it leapfrog into the new economy.\r\nHigh-speed connectivity at low cost will increase the use of ICT. It is also the way for Smart and Globe to properly interconnect. Then we will finally hear the last of those annoying words, \u201cnetwork busy.\u201d\r\nOur rules will promote rather than regulate ICT, but in turn, I ask cellular phone companies to stop charging on dropped calls; this is both irritating and unfair to the public.\r\nI ask Congress to enact laws to address Internet privacy and security, allow for multimedia convergence, and create a department of telecommunications and information technology.\r\nTo prepare our youth to be the next generation of knowledge workers, we will upgrade math and science teaching in basic education.\r\nWe will take a hard look at education and ask: Is it preparing the youth for the jobs of the new economy? Or is it just-keeping-them-off-the-streets-until-they-are-thrown-there jobless after graduation? If they finish school at all.\r\nTo increase the chances of Filipino children finishing school, we will minimize the cost of going to school. When we stopped the collection of miscellaneous fees last enrollment day, 900,000 more students enrolled than anticipated. And to reduce the time and money spent to actually travel to school, I want a school building in every barangay by 2004. Ibig nating tumalas ang ulo ng mga estudyante, at hindi malaspag ang paa.\r\nTo improve the quality of education as required by the new economy, we will increase the number of textbooks per student as well as the quality of instruction. This year all public school students will have textbooks for priority subjects in grades 1 to 4 and in the 1st and 2nd years of high school. And they will have better paid and therefore better motivated teachers, not to mention more teachers because sound fiscal management enabled us to provide a supplemental budget of 1.5 billion pesos to hire more teachers and increase their pay without increasing our deficit.\r\nAside from ICT, we also have the competitive edge in tourism in the natural wonders of our country and the natural warmth of our people. We will provide the roads to those wonders and the means to take the tourists there. Thus, we will continue to liberalize the airline industry.\r\nThe second component of our national agenda to fight poverty is the modernization of agriculture founded on social equity.\r\nNasa bukid ang nakararaming maralita, kaya payayamanin natin ang pagsasaka at pangingisda.\r\nThere can be a million new jobs in agriculture and fisheries. Within the year, the Department of Agriculture shall begin to implement the program to generate them. We will approach this with a sense of urgency. I do not want the one million new jobs to come in the long term. I want a timetable. I want to identify accountabilities. I want milestones.\r\nHindi ito pangakong mapapako dahil nakasalalay rito ang kabuhayan ng milyung-milyong maralitang pilipino.\r\nMga kababayan kong magsasaka, ang inyong pangulo mismo ang magbabantay sa kagalingan ninyo.\r\nStarting tomorrow I will hold office at the Department of Agriculture, until i can get a clear and demonstrable picture of our agricultural accomplishments for our first 100 days and I can see the program for the million new jobs get off the ground, and I can see that short-term goals are in sync with the goals of farmer groups and agribusiness.\r\nUpang lumikha ng isang milyong trabaho sa kanayunan, tutuparin natin sa wakas ang Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act o AFMA. Hindi bababa sa 20 bilyong piso ang gagastusin upang mapalakas ang kita, ani, at huli ng magsasaka at mangingisda. Kasama na rito ang mga sumusunod: 6 na bilyon sa patubig; 2 bilyon sa postharvest facilities; 2 bilyon sa imprastraktura; 2 bilyon sa pautang; at 2 bilyon sa research and development.\r\nThere is money\u2014and there will be money\u2014and the Department of Agriculture shall demonstrate its capacity to use these funds.\r\nSa 6 na bilyong piso sa patubig at 2 bilyon sa postharvest mula Aparri hanggang Jolo, makakalikha tayo ng 800,000 trabaho. Sa pagbukas ng 200,000 ektarya ng bagong lupang masasaka, makakalikha ito ng 200,000 trabaho. Sa ganitong paraan malilikha ang 1 milyong trabaho sa kanayunan.\r\nNgunit dapat tiyakin ang merkado ng produksyon ng mga bagong magtatrabaho sa agrikultura at pangingisda pati na rin ng kasalukuyang magsasaka at mangingisda.\r\nPara sa kaginhawaan ng taong bayan, dapat hindi nagkukulang ang bigas. Sabi nga ng AFMA, sikapin nating magkaroon ng rice self-sufficiency. In the meantime, we will remove the monopoly of the NFA in importation. If a shortage seems likely, we will allow the farmers themselves to import rice, basta magbayad sila ng customs duties. Gagamitin naman ang binayarang buwis para sa modernisasyon ng rice production.\r\nMurang bigas at masaganang magsasaka\u2014ito ang hangad natin para sa masa.\r\nMas malaki pa ang matutulong ng gobyerno sa mga magsasaka ng niyog oras na maresolba pabor sa magsasaka ang kaso ng coconut levy. Kapag mangyari ito, gagamitin ang pondo para sa modernisasyon ng mga niyugan. Pinawalang-bisa ko ang kautusan sa coconut levy mula sa dating administrasyon upang hindi madehado ang magsasaka. Hindi tayo hihinto habang hindi nakikinabang ang mangniyu-niyog sa coco levy fund.\r\nTo fight poverty, agricultural modernization will be socially equitable. We shall redeem in earnest the promise of land reform, a commitment that spans several presidents. Isa pa itong pangakong hindi dapat mapako.\r\nBawat taon, mamamahagi ang gobyerno ng 200,000 ektarya para sa reporma sa lupa: 100,000 of private land and 100,000 hectares of public land, including 100 ancestral domain titles for indigenous peoples.\r\nWe will bring our war against poverty to rural Mindanao, especially the areas most affected by the past conflicts. We have helped more than half of the 27,000 evacuee families return to their farms and rehabilitate their homes. The rest will go back home this year. In the next 12 months, we will spend 500 million pesos from the OPEC fund for community projects in these areas.\r\nIf the long-delayed Malmar irrigation dam is not completed by September, I will transfer its construction to the army engineering brigade. This dam is so important because it will irrigate 3,000 hectares immediately, with another 10,000 to follow next year.\r\nWe will make Mindanao the gateway to ASEAN by putting back on track the East ASEAN growth area.\r\nInshala, mahimo tinu-od ang saad sa Mindanao ubos sa akong administrasyon.\r\nThe third component of our national agenda is a social bias to balance economic development.\r\nThis social bias consists in immediate measures for the poor as well as improving and ensuring the quality of life of the masses.\r\nBukod sa magbubukid, maralitang taga-lungsod ang malaking sektor na kailangan ang dagliang tulong.\r\nUpang agad silang matulungan, nabigyan na ng ating administrasyon ang karapatang bumili ng lupang tinitirahan sa mahigit 80,000 pamilyang maralita. And we will work double time to give security of land tenure to 150,000 urban poor families every year; 150,000 pamilya taun-taon ang magkakaroon ng karapatan na bumili ng sariling tirahan. Ginagawa ko ito dahil nalulungkot ako \u2018pag may nakikita akong squatter sa sariling bayan.\r\nDapat din tugunan ang karaingan ng madla sa mahal na bilihin at kulang na sahod. Umaasa akong magpapasya ang kongreso o wage board sa nararapat na sweldo. Pansamantala, nananawagan ako sa mga negosyanteng may kakayahan: Magbigay na kayo agad ng emergency cost of living allowance. Maaari naman itong i-credit kapag may bagong sahod o allowance mula sa batas o sa wage board.\r\nSa kabilang dako, kumikilos ang gobyerno upang mapigilan ang pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pangunahing pangangailangan ng manggagawa. Binabantayan ang presyo ng langis, at salamat naman na bumaba ito noong Biyernes. Pinagsisikapan din ng gobyernong huwag itaas ang pasahe, lalo na ang LRT.\r\nDahil ang presyo ng bigas ay napakaimportante sa mga manggagawa, magpapasada tayo ng 1,000 rolling stores. Ang mga manggagawa at maralita ay makakabili dito ng bigas sa halagang 14 na piso sa halip na 18 bawat kilo.\r\nBababa din ang presyo ng gamot. Sa loob ng isang taon hahatiin natin ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng madla.\r\nAt upang iwasan ang malaking gastos sa pagpapagamot, itong taon, ilalahok sa national health insurance ang kalahating milyong maralitang taga-lungsod. Sa ganoong paraan, ang insurance ang magbabayad ng pagpapagamot.\r\nAt upang maiwasan ang pag-upa na nagbabantang tumaas, tinutulungan natin na magkaroon ng sariling tahanan ang mga manggagawa at maralita. Handa na ang 10,000 tahahan sa iba\u2019t ibang lugar para lumipat na rito ang manggagawa at maralita. Pinondohan na rin natin ang pagtayo ng 18,000 pang tahanan. Taun-taon, magtatayo ng 100,000 tirahan para sa manggagawa at 50,000 pabahay para sa higit na maralita. Nakahanda sa government financial institutions ang 20 bilyong piso para sa pabahay ng manggagawa.\r\nItaga ninyo: 20 bilyong piso para sa mga tahanan ng masa. Ito ang handog ng gobyerno para sa seguridad ng pamilyang Pilipino.\r\nUpang mapatakbo ng mabuti ang mga programang ito, hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na lumikha ng kagawaran ng pabahay. A department of housing will not only build homes for the poor, it will also spark the housing industry and create jobs.\r\nHinihiling ko rin sa Kongreso na sa tax reform na gagawin ninyo, damihan ang kategoriya ng manggagawang hindi na kailangang magbayad ng buwis.\r\nMayroon tayong espesyal na proyekto para sa mga kabataang maralita ng Metro Manila na hindi na makapag-aral, ngunit walang trabaho. This is the Emergency Employment Program. Bawat taon, 20,000 out-of-work, out-of-school youth ang bibigyan ng dagliang trabaho. Maaari magtagpi ng bubong, mag-ayos ng railing, mag-gwardya sa eskwela ng kanilang barangay, maglinis ng kalsada o estero, o iba pang dagliang trabaho.\r\nThe social bias in our economic development plan involves ensuring the quality of life of the masses.\r\nSa sulat ni Erwin na taga-Payatas\u2014\u2018yung binanggit ko kaninang pag-umpisa ng diskurso\u2014hiniling niya na ipasara ang dumpsite. Talaga namang dapat nang magkaroon tayo ng bagong sistema sa pag-aasikaso ng basura. Basura ang sanhi ng maraming problema sa siyudad: masamang hangin, paglaganap ng sakit, trapik, at iba pa. Tapusin na natin ito. Inatasan ko ang Metro Manila Development Authority na bago makalipas ang isang taon, maglunsad ng programa upang ayusin ang problema ng basura.\r\nSuyang-suya na rin tayong lahat, lalo na ang madla, sa trapiko ng Metro Manila. Babawasan ang trapik sa tulong ng mass transit. Nagtatayo tayo ng limang bagong linya ng mass transit para makapagbigay-ginhawa sa halos 4 na milyong pasahero. Tatlong linya matatapos sa 2004, isa sa 2005, at isa pa sa 2006. These five mass transit systems are being prioritized because they will add 119 kilometers of railway projects. During construction, I expect the MMDA to minimize the resulting congestion, and I expect it to minimize the current congestion within six months.\r\nMasyadong masikip ang Metro Manila, kaya miserable ang buhay sa slum areas. Magkakaroon ng mabilis na transportasyong magdurugtong ng mga karatig-rehiyon sa Kamaynilaan. Ang nasisikipan na sa Maynila, makakalipat balang araw sa maaliwalas na lalawigan.\r\nWe will decongest Metro Manila by attracting communities north towards Subic-Clark, and south towards CALABARZON and Batangas port. We will achieve this not by demolishing shanties but by building commuter and transport systems to better homes.\r\nWhether in Metro Manila or in the countryside, we will make microfinance a cornerstone in our fight against poverty. Ang ibig sabihin nito ay maliliit na paluwagan para sa maliliit na negosyo. Kakalisensiya lang ng opportunity microfinance bank, ang unang microlending program sa bansa na naging bangko. Bawat taon, dadagdagan natin ng 300,000 maralitang kababaihan ang makikinabang sa paluwagang programa ng microfinance.\r\nPanahon na upang makinabang ang maliliit sa iniimpok ng bayan. At umasa kayo, nagbabayad ang masa. In microfinance, the repayment rate is 98 percent.\r\nWala pang kuryente ang marami nating barangay. Kaya araw-araw, gabi-gabi, magkakabit ng kuryente sa apat na barangay. Sa ganoon, 85 porsyento ng barangay ay magkakailaw na sa loob ng isang taon.\r\nWith exports slowing down due to the world downturn, we will strengthen the domestic market. We will intensify efforts to promote small and medium enterprises or SMEs especially in the countryside. Last Friday I inaugurated the SME board in the Philippine Stock Exchange. To help small and medium enterprises, I will restore the policy of providing government guarantee for their bank loans.\r\nThe fourth component of our national agenda is improving moral standards and the rule of law.\r\nWe need every ounce of resource to wage this war on poverty. We cannot afford to lose anything to waste or graft and corruption.\r\nFirst we must strengthen justice and the enforcement of law and order.\r\nThis pertains to two levels. At the level of principle, this administration affirms its commitment to the principle that no one is above the law.\r\nThus, our policy is to support the fair and speedy trial of all the accused involved in the cases against Former President Joseph Estrada.\r\nIf there were times that I showed concern for the personal circumstances of the former president, it is not a sign of diminished determination to see justice done.\r\nRather, it is out of sensitivity to the feelings of the segments of our masa who have continued to identify with his personal circumstances.\r\nBut as I sometimes extend a hand covered by a velvet glove, inside it is an iron hand where justice and the rule of law are concerned.\r\nAs a sign of this, I will support legislation to amend the charter of the ombudsman so he can accept the services of private prosecutors.\r\nThe second level pertains to our sense that justice prevails and the rule of law works in our daily lives.\r\nA reenergized police will stamp out the crimes that have plagued our businesses, terrorized the common folk, and embarrassed our country. In the economics of fighting crime, the more resources devoted to crime prevention, the less the amount of crime. Our administration will spend to modernize and professionalize the police. We will start with 1 billion pesos.\r\nAlthough the numbers say that index crimes in the first semester were down 14 percent since a year ago, we are determined to stamp out violent crimes altogether. The ongoing reorganization of the police is part of the effort to add vigor to its anti-crime drive. The new national anti-crime commission will tighten coordination among law enforcement agencies as well as with the Chinese-Filipino community. We are giving special attention to the kidnap-for-ransom syndicates. I want the bulk of them to be behind bars before the year is over, so that every Filipino will at last feel safe in his home, in his workplace, and in his streets.\r\nOn the drug front, I ask Congress to enact a law reducing the amount of drugs in a suspect\u2019s possession for him to be charged with drug trafficking.\r\nWe will uphold law and order through a holistic response consisting of political, economic, psychosocial, and security components. We will meet the defense and security challenges of this era. To achieve this end, we have earmarked additional funding in several billions of pesos for the AFP modernization program.\r\nWe have given the Armed Forces and the police the leeway to fight a treacherous and elusive enemy in Basilan. But it must end, and it will end soon, for good. The leadership of the Abu Sayyaf has started to fall. The crackdown has neutralized 130 of them. Many of them have come down from their mountains because they have been abandoned by their leaders. Itaga ninyo sa bato: tatapusin natin ito.\r\nOn the peace process, while the AFP stands ready to protect our people at a moment\u2019s notice, we will continue to talk with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front as long as all sides maintain good faith. Our ceasefire agreement with the MILF last month encouraged us in this.\r\nTo attain our full potential as a nation, let us come to terms with the fundamental issues in Mindanao. Let us forge consensus on a just, lasting, and honorable peace in one country. Peace and development are inseparable twins. But our framework must not compromise constitutionality, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Instead, let us recognize that we have a multiethnic society which should be founded on social justice for all and institutionalized accommodation of ethnic traditions. This would finally introduce a new culture in our nation\u2019s attitude towards Mindanao.\r\nWe will also introduce a new culture in governance: a culture of plain talk and common sense.\r\nCabinet secretaries will do less cluster and interagency committee work so they can concentrate on running their departments. Less meetings, more action, more tangible results whether in generating jobs, improving peace and order, or fighting graft.\r\nI throw full support behind BIR commissioner Rene Ba\u00f1ez. He has undertaken a mission many believe impossible: overhauling the BIR which accounts for 80 percent of our tax revenues.\r\nRene has been threatened. He has been blocked by restraining orders at every turn. After the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, he was accused of the very corruption he is stamping out.\r\nThis man needs friends, who share his goals, and I know he will find them in this young Congress.\r\nThe Bureau of Customs is exceeding collection targets. But the anti-smuggling drive must be relentless. So must the drive against the harassment of legitimate businessmen doing legitimate imports. I call on all concerned to help end the open drawer syndrome.\r\nBut the government cannot do it alone. It cannot do it alone in customs, it cannot do it alone in fighting graft, it cannot do it alone in fighting poverty. I\u2019m not a miracle worker. All of us must do our share. We have to think Filipino, buy Filipino, invest Filipino. I invite the taipans and other business people all over the country to start pump-priming the economy by investing once again in the Philippines. I invite you to create jobs, accelerate progress, and thereby address the root causes of the crime and unrest that so much alarm us.\r\nSa madaling salita, mga kababayan, magkaisa tayo at magtulung-tulong upang labanan ang salot ng kahirapan at isulong ang kasaganaan, kapayapaan, at katarungan sa bayan. Magkaisa tayo. Labanan ang kahirapan.\r\nMarami na akong sinabi tungkol sa gagawin ko. Subalit mabibigkas sa ilang salita lamang ang pakay ng lahat ng mga plano, programa, at panukalang tinukoy ko: trabaho, edukasyon, sariling tahanan, pagkain sa bawat mesa.\r\nSa lahat ng mabibigay ko sa bayan, kabuhayan, karunungan, tahanan, at pagkain para sa masa ang ipagmamalaki ko nang higit sa lahat.\r\nLahat ng ito ay para sa mga kabataang tulad nila Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, at sa magiging anak nila dahil tungkulin natin ito sa mga darating na henerasyon.\r\nMga kababayan, nais ko pong ipakilala sa inyo ang mga anak ng Payatas. Eto sina Jason, Jomar, at Erwin.\r\nSalamat sa inyo, Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Salamat at sumulat kayo sa akin ng mga liham na ginawa ninyong bangkang papel at pinalutang sa Pasig.\r\nJayson, Jomar, at Erwin, pakinggan niyo ako.\r\nPaparamihin natin ang mga kababayang may trabaho. Paparamihin natin ang mga batang makapag-aaral sa kolehiyo. Paparamihin natin ang mga kababayang may sariling tahanan. Paparamihin natin ang pamilyang may pagkain sa mesa. Ang pangarap ninyo ay pangarap ko rin. Gagawin ko ang lahat upang matupad ang pangarap natin.\r\nMga kababayan: tulungan ninyo akong tuparin ang pangarap nila Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Magkaisa tayo upang lahat ng kabataan\u2014kasama ang kanilang magulang\u2014ay magkaroon ng bagong buhay at bagong pag-asa sa hinaharap.\r\nTrabaho. Tahanan. Edukasyon. Pagkain sa bawat mesa.\r\nSalamat, Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, pinaalala ninyo sa akin ang napakahalagang tungkulin ko.\r\nPinaalala ninyo sa aming lahat kung bakit kami ay narito ngayon sa bulwagang ito.\r\nMga Senador at Kongresista: Ipangako natin sa kanila, sa harap at sa tulong ng Poong Maykapal, na sa mga susunod na araw, buwan, at taon, tayong mga hinalal, tayong may pananagutan sa kanilang kinabukasan ay handang magsakripisyo at magkaisa para sa kabutihan, kaunlaran, katatagan ng bayan, at sa kinabukasan ng kabataan.\r\nJayson, Jomar, at Erwin, hindi namin kayo bibiguin.\r\nI am not a miracle worker. But I will do what is right and I will do my best. Let us all do what is right, let us all do what is best, and God will take care of the rest.\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.", "title": "First State of the Nation Address"},

In this gallery of the highest public servants, none sits in sterner judgment than the man who first led me by the hand into the Palace as a teenager.\r\nIn a country where a man\u2019s worth was measured by his property, he was born in a nipa hut, into a family that tilled less than a hectare of land.\r\nAfter years of hard struggle and brilliant achievement, my father took his oath as President of the Philippines on ground made hallow by the martyrdom of our national hero. A hero whose name he would honor, and whose ideals he would pursue.\r\nIndeed, in a democracy, a man may rise to the nation\u2019s highest service by dint of energy and intelligence alone, without regard to wealth and connections of which my father had none.\r\nIt was Jose Rizal who wrote: \u201cA life not dedicated to a great ideal is useless; a mere pebble in the field that forms no part of an edifice.\u201d\r\nThe words of Diosdado Macapagal echoed this theme as he assumed the mantle of national leadership 40 years ago: \u201cNo President can build the whole edifice of a nation. All that he is called upon to do is add a fine stone to that edifice, so that those who shall come after him may add other fine stones that will go for a strong and enduring structure.\u201d\r\nModest words from a modest man who would yet change for all time how a feudal society would come to view a vital institution\u2014land reform.\r\nMy countrymen, the fine stone I should like to add to the edifice of our nation, right above the stone of social justice that my father left behind, is a strong republic.\r\nTwo essential features mark out a strong republic. The first is independence from class and sectoral interests so that it stands for the interests of the people rather than of a powerful minority. The second is the capacity, represented through strong institutions and a strong bureaucracy, to execute good policy and deliver essential services\u2014the things that only governments can do.\r\nThe results of these two features\u2014good policies and empowered institutions\u2014is faster economic development and social reform. A strong republic takes care of the people and takes care of their future. Thus, a strong republic is the bedrock of the victory we seek over poverty within the decade.\r\nDuring these past 18 months, our efforts to build the strong republic have been difficult, with both domestic and global conditions extremely harsh. At home, the poor were pitted against the rich to further inflame our nation\u2019s social divisions.\u00a0Abroad, the contracting economies of our main trading partners were further aggravated by the tensions generated by the global war against terrorism.\r\nMeanwhile, one shocking corporate scandal after another severely eroded public faith in the most promising system for conducting economic activity\u2014the free market.\r\nThese were the large long-term crises of social justice and the capitalist system itself, whose resolution awaits events well beyond one small nation\u2019s ability to influence in the short term.\r\nBut as I report on the state of the nation today, I can say this: The immediate crises have been resolved.\r\nThis resolution was achieved by focusing on three things.\r\nFirst, by showing tangible results in the delivery of government services. Thus, in my State of the Nation Address last year, I did something never done before: I detailed a long list of measurable targets that would show a government on the move, marking progress by swift sure steps, despite the turbulent state of domestic and global affairs.\r\nHalimbawa, target natin noong isang taon: 200,000 ektarya para sa land reform. Nakamit natin: 250,000 ektarya. [\r\n] Congratulations sa mga probinsiyang topnotchers: Negros Occidental, at Sultan Kudarat, [\r\n] itong dalawang\u00a0 probinsiya bawat isa ay humigit ng 7,000 ektarya ng reporma sa lupa.\r\nTarget natin: 20 bilyong piso para sa modernisasyon ng agrikultura. Nakamit natin: 24 na bilyon. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: 150,000 pamilyang maralitang tagalunsod na makatitiyak sa lupang tinitirikan. Nakamit natin: 180,000. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: 150,000 pamilyang mahihirap na magkaroon ng pabahay. Nakamit natin: 150,000 na nga. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: 1,000 rolling stores na magbebenta ng bigas sa P14 per kilo. Nakamit natin: 1,500 rolling stores. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: ibaba sa kalahati ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng mahihirap. Nakamit natin: Mahahanap ang mababang presyong gamot sa mga parmasya ng 80 ospital ng pamahalaan at sa mga outlet ng Unilab. [\r\n] But sad to say, except for Unilab, the wider distribution of network of commercial drugstores\u2014under pressure from the multinational drug companies\u2014will not sell our cheaper medicines. We are studying punitive measures to correct this unfair, unjust, and heartless situation. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: 500,000 maralita para sa health insurance. Nakamit natin: 4 na milyon. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: pagdating ng 2004, may eskwela sa bawat barangay. May 1,612 na barangay na wala pang eskwela. Nakamit natin: 1,005 na malapit nang matapos, bukod pa sa 285 school buildings na humahalagang P100 million galing sa alokasyon ni Senate President Franklin Drilon. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: kompletong libro sa pangunahing subjects sa grades 1 to 4 at sa 1st at 2nd year high school. Nakamit natin: Magkakaroon ngayong taon ng 54 million books para sa 16 na milyong estudyante. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: pag-ibayuhin ang pagtuturo ng mathematics. Nakamit natin: dagdag na oras para sa Math sa bagong curriculum.\r\nTarget natin: mas maraming guro. Nakamit natin: 15,000 bagong guro. [\r\n]\r\nTarget natin: dagliang trabaho para sa 20,000 out-of-school youth. Nakamit natin: 30,000. [\r\n]\r\nAt noong isang taon, dinala ko ang tatlong batang kumatawan sa adhkain ng Payatas. Sabi nila, ang kailangan nila ay edukasyon, kabuhayan, pabahay. Higit na 400 na batang taga-Payatas ay iskolar na ngayon, kasama na si Jayson, Erwin, at Jomar. [\r\n] Halos 800 pamilya ang nabigyan ng kabuhayan kasama ang pamilya nila. May 700 pamilyang binigyan ng karapatang bilhin ang lupang kanilang tinitirahan nila doon sa Payatas. Inaatasan ko ang Department of Environment and Natural Resources na apurahin ang pag-ayos ng natitirang problema sa lupa ng mga residente sa Payatas. [\r\n]\r\nThis is just the tip of our accomplishments, all in just the first year of the 10-year fight I projected against poverty. I am submitting the entire iceberg to Congress in a comprehensive performance report. For good measure, it has been published and nationally circulated. These were our commitments. We delivered on them. A strong republic does what it says.\r\nIt takes care of the people and takes care of their future.\r\nOur second focus to achieve the resolution of the immediate crises was the preservation and defense of the republic against forces that seek to destroy its unity and tear the fabric of its society, not least in the name of ideas that history has already passed by.\r\nThe turning points are clear.\r\nThis year, May 1 passed peacefully.\r\nThis year, our soldiers rescued Gracia Burnham and finished off her terrorist captor. [\r\n]\r\nThis year, what used to be Camp Abubakar became an authentic community of new hopes and dreams, where our flag flies and our soldiers protect those who have returned to their homes.\r\nBeyond the symbolic significance of these accomplishments, we have brought back interfaith solidarity, energized by the invaluable initiative of Speaker Jose de Venecia, [\r\n] and we have sealed peace agreements with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.\r\nWe achieved all of these backed by the valor, professionalism, and restraint of our soldiers and police. I salute our men and women in uniform, at the forefront of our Republic\u2019s efforts to fight terror and enforce peace.\r\nThe third focus to resolve the crises and build a strong republic was to restore macroeconomic stability and win back investor confidence.\r\nThe linchpin was to control our fiscal deficit. If EDSA 2 had not happened, the government would simply have gone bankrupt with a deficit of P245 billion. [\r\n] But we controlled the deficit, brought it down to P147 billion, and against all odds, turned our international credit rating from risky to stable. [\r\n] It was hard work, here and abroad, to rekindle global interest in our country, but we did it. [\r\n]\r\nThe adoption of strong administrative measures, including fighting smuggling and graft and corruption, will enable us to close the gap in our revenue targets for this year.\r\nThe basic macro signs indicate that things are under control. Inflation is at a low, driven down by stable food prices and now by declining power costs. [\r\n]\r\nNang ako ay naging Pangulo, ang presyo ng galunggong ay 80 pesos ang kilo. Noong isang linggo, nakabili ako sa palengke ng 60 pesos lamang. [\r\n] Ang presyo rin ng bigas na binibili ng mahihirap ay nananatiling P16 ang kilo sa palengke at P14 sa rolling store, gaya pa rin nang isang taon. [\r\n]\r\nInterest rates are also at a low, and our peso is stable. From P56 to the dollar, it is now a little over P50. [\r\n]\r\nInternationally, the Philippines is back on the map.\r\nWe are the third best performing economy is Asia and the best in southeast Asia. [\r\n]\r\nAs a result of our decisive action after September 11, the Philippines is now a recognized player in world affairs. The President of the Philippines was the first head of government to emphasize the interconnection between the war against terrorism and the war against poverty. Now, nations large and small now embrace this interconnection. [\r\n]\r\nWe have gained powerful allies in our domestic war against terrorism. I am certain that our increased international visibility will continue generating capital inflows for the Philippines.\r\nWhere we have fallen short of achieving what we intended, it has not been from misdirection or a lack of trying. After all, it has really been only one year and a half.\r\nIn any event, I promise to work even harder if that is possible, and do even better because I believe that there is always room for improvement. I cannot grow taller but I can always get better. [\r\n]\r\nMy working agenda for the coming year will focus on creating and improving job opportunities. Citizens with rewarding jobs paying decent wages constitute not just a stone in the edifice but the very foundation of a strong republic.\r\nWe need investments to generate jobs, and to draw in investments, we will address certain problems in the short term: katiwalian, peace and order, and the cost of power. [\r\n]\r\nBilang Pangulo, tinatanggap ko ang pahayag ng mga negosyante na dapat sugpuin ang katiwalian sa bansa.\r\nNoong isang taon nga sa aking State of the Nation Address, sinabi ko na, na aalisin natin ang mga hadlang sa ating productivity, kagaya ng mahal na kuryente at katiwalian.\r\nAt dahil ako ay naluklok sa pagkapangulo dala ng malawakang galit sa anomaliya, alam kong kailangan wakasan ang katiwalian. [\r\n] Naniniwala rin ako na pinahihina ng katiwalian ang daloy ng puhunan sa ating bansa.\r\nKaya noong isang taon, sinabi ko na ang kabinete ko ay kailangan gumawa ng konkretong resulta sa paglaban sa katiwalian. Pinapaalala ko sa kanila ngayon na sa mga sumusunod na araw, magbigay ng kanilang ulat sa naturang mga resulta.\r\nBut even now I can tell you that our new e-Procurement Program is saving billions and minimizing anomalies.\r\nEven now, I can tell you that the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission [PAGC] is doing its best to ensure that good governance is carried out. Inaatasan ko ang PAGC na gumawa rin ng ulat sa kanilang trabaho.\r\nTungkol naman sa katiwalian sa mga korte, inaatasan ko ang Department of Justice [DOJ] na kasuhan yung prosecutor na tinuloy pa iyong kaso kontra sa Kimberly-Clark kahit nagkaroon na ng affidavit of desistance ang complainant. Kaya tuloy ang Kimberly-Clark ay dinala iyong kanyang Asia operations sa Thailand imbes na sa Pilipinas. Inaasahan ko ring kasuhan ng DOJ iyong prosecutor na ginawang accessory lamang embes na principal iyong ilang mga nagkidnap kay Rowena Tiu. At inaatasan ko rin ang DOJ na kasuhan pati na rin ang mga huwes na gumagawa ng katiwalian. [\r\n]\r\nNoong isang taon, sinabi ko na gagawin nating sample ang BIR at Customs sa paglaban sa katiwalian.\u00a0This is still a continuing effort. Tax evasion is a white-collar crime and the response is a white collar response\u2014systems improvement, audit, prosecution. Smuggling is something else. It is done by hoodlums and criminal gangs. But the punishment for both must be the same: blue-collar time. Kalaboso. [\r\n]\r\nIndeed, criminal gangs and homegrown terrorists have exploited the poisoned political atmosphere to spread poisons of their own: rampant smuggling, kidnapping, gambling, drug dealing, rampant smuggling.\r\nYou have seen political will in the harsh interpretation of command responsibility with regard to illegal gambling. That draconian application was a dress rehearsal for enforcing command responsibility in the even more difficult challenges of kidnapping, drug dealing, and smuggling. [\r\n]\r\nI am determined to build a strong republic by breaking the back of terrorism and criminality. [\r\n]\r\nIn the year 2000, despite all the rampant efforts of rampant smuggling, only P16 million worth was confiscated. But last year, in a show of political will, my administration seized P1.2 billion worth of smuggled goods, [\r\n] including more than a million bags of smuggled rice, as compared to much less than a hundred thousand the year before. [\r\n]\r\nI congratulated the Commissioner of Customs but told him also: Go beyond getting smuggled goods and get me the big-time smugglers. [\r\n] I have instructed the DOJ to charge these big-time smugglers not just with smuggling but also with economic sabotage\u2014nonbailable capital offense. [\r\n]\r\nCriminal syndicates will be treated as what they are\u2014direct threats to national security. Criminals are criminals, whether of the common kind or the kind that kill in the name of political advocacies. They will feel the full brunt of the arsenal of democracy. Freedom, too, is entitled to self-defense. [\r\n]\r\nI have given very clear orders to spare nothing in hunting down kidnappers.\r\nWe will go by scorecards and track progress by counting beans, if we have to.\r\nRemember Mary Grace Rosagas of Uratex who was kidnapped from UP. Remember her aunt Connie Wong who was killed by the kidnappers. Remember Rowena Tiu who was kidnapped in La Union. Remember the owner of Liana Supermarket. Remember the whispers about the kidnapping of the granddaughter a big banker and the son of a steel magnate. We have taken down the syndicates responsible for kidnapping them and 52 other victims. [\r\n] In the process, 170 kidnappers were either killed or captured.\r\nThe ideal response to kidnapping was in the case of Rowena Tiu. She was rescued in 8 days, the ransom money recovered, and her kidnappers were arrested and are now facing trial. That is why hers was the first but the last kidnapping to take place in Region I in my administration. [\r\n]\r\nI want to smash the other 21 syndicates in the same way. [\r\n] We are getting a clearer picture of the leadership, membership, and area of operations of these syndicates. I now want their linkages and modus operandi. I am overseeing how they are being watched, tracked, and infiltrated. We will start with the two biggest syndicates, the Bucala and Fajardo gangs. I have challenged the Philippine National Police [PNP] to eliminate them within a year. [\r\n]\r\nI have told the PNP that they must start with the cleansing of their own ranks. You remember the front page photograph of that shootout last Saturday? In the front seat next to the driver was a PNP Academy Graduate but AWOL from the police force. He was the planner and the negotiator of that gang. The rascals among the police disgrace the uniform and unfortunately paint in the same broad brush the majority who do their duty well.\r\nI salute the men and women of the police who scorned to be bribed and confiscated 500 kilograms of shabu in Quezon Province last year, and caught the biggest fish so far in the drug trade. [\r\n]\r\nI salute the men and women who raided the shabu factories in Batangas, Zambales, San Juan, Varsity Hills, and other places, seizing a total of P5 billion worth of illegal drugs and laboratory equipment in the largest drug busts ever in our history of crime fighting. [\r\n]\r\nWithin a month, we shall organize the new Dangerous Drugs Board and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency which Congress has just created, and I thank Senator Barbers for sponsoring the bill in the Senate. With the drug menace now elevated to the level of a national security problem and no longer just a police problem, I am instructing the Armed Forces of the Philippines to field military resources for intelligence and to field soldiers in drug raids in support of civilian law enforcement. Drug lords will be treated as enemies of the State!\r\nIn this war with the drug trade there will be no compromise and no quarter, not for fear or favor.\r\nIndeed, we are at war: at war with the terrorists, at war with the kidnappers, at war with the drug lords\u2014and we are determined to win decisive victories on all fronts.\r\nThe global antiterrorist coalition is a historical watershed. This new global consensus helps us immensely in finally breaking the cycle of terrorism and criminality. To that end, we shall enhance our strategic relationship with the United States through continuing training exercises to sharpen our soldiers\u2019 capabilities to move and communicate, to fix and finish off their targets.\r\nI am happy to let you know that yesterday we captured the mastermind of the General Santos bombings that killed and maimed 80 persons a few months ago. This man that they captured yesterday is considered the number one terrorist bomber.\r\nWe cannot afford to lose. Even a stalemate will be a defeat. For what is at stake is our country as a viable proposition in the world economy. And we must be viable if we are to win the most fundamental war, the war against poverty.\r\nI ask the newly elected barangay captains to take an active role in this war. To be the frontliners in this fight in your communities.\r\nAnd as with war in the past, so will it be with this war. As Commander in Chief, I am taking a direct hand in the war against the enemies of the Republic. This was how I did it with the Abu Sayyaf, leading to the death of Abu Sabaya. This is how I will do it with the criminal gangs.\r\nNakasalalay dito ang pamamayani ng ating Republika. Our strong republic.\r\nAt stake in this war is the very life of society, the very possibility of basic rights and liberties, which have been under attack for too long.\r\nThe right to work in peace is as basic as the right to life and liberty, and when both are in danger their preservation by all lawful means becomes not just a higher right but an overriding duty. And that duty I will discharge.\r\nThis is a war we will wage on behalf, and with the rage, of all the victims: those whose businesses were ruined by extortion, those held down by poverty in fear, those whose lives were snuffed out by addiction, and those taken hostage and killed. To them, I say: We shall redeem your pain; we shall redeem your loss.\r\nI endorse to the collective wisdom of Congress, with a great sense of urgency, a new bill that will strengthen our legal armory in this war: the Anti-Terrorism Bill. When passed into law, this bill will plug the loopholes by which crimes spread and democracy is undermined. Congress will also note a reallocation of resources in this year\u2019s budget to enhance the Republic\u2019s crime-fighting capabilities.\r\nThere are a number of other critical bills linked closely to the overall run of social, economic, and political reform. I will hold more meetings with the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council, or LEDAC, to push this momentum of reform.\r\nWe must team up, as I said last year, to enact a law making farmland acceptable as loan collateral in order to remove a big deterrent to investments in agriculture.\r\nWe must pass the Special Purpose Vehicle Act in order to encourage asset management companies to put back into productive circulation assets now tied up in problematic loans.\r\nWe must pass a law to give overseas Filipinos the right to vote, consistent with the Constitution. We must pass the bill that will give equal respect and recognition to an overseas Filipino\u2019s dual citizenship, consistent with our national honor. This is the least return for the enormous contribution of our overseas Filipinos to the national welfare.\r\nWe must pass the Transco Franchise Bill to make our electric service more efficient and more reliable.\r\nEverywhere I go, I ask people about their electric bill. This is not just a pet concern for the moment. I think about it all the time.\r\nYou have seen your recent electric bills. You know they have gone down. Because I brought down the PPA.\r\nI did not invent the PPA. I merely inherited it. But my administration chose to confront and stare it in the face and find the solutions.\r\nBefore I became President, we had the second most expensive power rates in Asia. Now we have gone down to sixth. This is first fruit of a comprehensive 10-point plan we have put in place to reduce power costs.\r\nWe have brought electricity for the first time to the barangays of Balud, Masbate, of Lake Lanao, and 1,500 other barangays.\r\nWe have improved the electric service in Boracay by taking over the electric cooperative. To other electric cooperatives, I ask you: be efficient in your operations and improve your customer service.\r\nTo the electric utilities, I ask you: be transparent in your procurement and your contracts with your affiliates.\r\nTo NAPOCOR and Meralco I ask you: Stop bickering and instead work together to give price incentives to large users so that excess power can be utilized, economic activity can be encouraged, and jobs can be created.\r\nThe results of the review of the contracts of independent power producers are in. We have three months to carry out the concrete courses of action stemming from this review that will further ease the burden on our people.\r\nSoon we shall have the first-ever wholesale electricity spot market in Asia, without the pitfalls of California. In due time, we will give electric consumers the power to choose their electricity suppliers. We are giving you the power of choice.\r\nThe power of choice will lead to lower prices and better service.\r\nWith cheaper power will come a more competitive economy, and more investors.\r\nWe know where we are going and how to get there; we are planting the milestones along the way to a strong republic and a prosperous country.\r\nA republic does not exist by the mere fact of declaring itself to be so.\r\nA republic must be so in fact, in reality, and especially in the difference it makes for the better in the lives of its citizens.\r\nIt is not a given but a task, a product undertaken by an entire society for its progress and preservation.\r\nA republic is like a shield that needs a strong arm to hold it up.\r\nA republic is a roof, and walls, that need to be constructed.\r\nA republic is an edifice towards the building of which each must give the finest stone within their ability to shape. In the end, this stone is the only thing by which one will be remembered.\r\nLike my father, I am working on my stone. The stone of the strong republic. I intend to be well remembered.\r\nLegions of ordinary Filipinos, many of them students, came, stood, and clamored at EDSA, for a better government.\r\nIt is to them I look for validation.\r\nI know that it is to me that those many Filipinos are looking for the vindication of their decision to go to EDSA. I shall not disappoint them.\r\nIt is for them that I am working hard on that stone that will fit just above my father\u2019s, adding security to social justice, and prosperity to the promise of social equality in which he believed so much.\r\nAng malakas na republika ay para sa mahihina, para sa mahihirap, para sa walang trabaho, para sa nagugutom, para sa nanganganib, para sa agrabyado, para sa mga api. \u2018Yan ang malakas na republika para sa kanila.\r\nToward the achievement of this strong republic, I shall bring to bear the full weight of the Executive, and call upon local government officials to add their own. This is our common struggle; it shall be our shared victory.\r\nI hope to get from Congress at least the same cooperation it extended to me last year.\r\nThe judicial branch needs no reminder of its key role in the unspoken component of justice, fairness, integrity, and truth in the equation of law and order.\r\nIt has been 18 months of putting out small fires and soothing hurt feelings, while taking what I hope have been giant steps forward in the economy.\r\nBut now the time has come. Now we must devote ourselves entirely to taking more of those giant steps towards the achievement of the strong republic.\r\nAs I look back, down the road on which I came, I see, with some regret, the shards of broken friendships. But I console myself by looking forward to a time when these broken friendships will heal and grievances will be forgotten in the collective satisfaction of our common success.\r\nFor in the end, we are one nation under God, one people, with one aspiration: A country as good as it can get!\r\nFor a country to be as good as it can get, many of the right decisions are tough decisions. I have made some of the toughest. And I will make even more tough decisions in the year to come. Because the easy way out may postpone the pain but only prolong the problem. The tough decisions are the right decisions, because they serve the people, and are the source of our hope for the future.\r\nIn the last year and a half:\r\nI led our nation in making the world recognize and respect our economic discipline.\r\nI led our soldiers in defeating the Abu Sayyaf.\r\nI led our government in meeting the targets we so bravely set for the welfare of our people.\r\nNow I will lead our country towards the strong republic.\r\nStay with me. Samahan niyo ako! Itayo natin ang matatag at malakas na republika!\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.", "title": "State of the Nation Address"},

Ramos; excellencies from the diplomatic corps led by Dean of the Diplomatic Corps Archbishop Antonio Franco; our Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo T. Reyes and commanding generals of the Armed Forces major services; honorable members of the 11th Congress; honorable members of the Cabinet; honorable local executives; other distinguished guests; my coworkers in government; First Lady Dra. Loi; mga minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nThis is the first opening session of Congress and my first State of the Nation Address to be held in the third millennium and in the 21st century. It is obviously an auspicious occasion for new beginnings.\r\nIt should be a new beginning for Mindanao, a new beginning for the economy, a new beginning for integrity in government, and a new beginning for the country. It will also be a new beginning for the presidency.\r\nTo begin with, we will write a new history for Mindanao. We will rectify centuries of historical wrongs committed by successive colonial powers, and decades of inequity committed by successive Philippine governments.\r\nMindanao has traditionally been called the\r\nThis romantic name has always been a one-way affair. The rest of the country has always expected Mindanao to fulfill its promises to them. It is now time for the rest of the country to fulfill its promises to Mindanao. [\r\n] \u00a0We should now convert Mindanao into the\r\nLet us not forget that Mindanao is an integral and organic part of the Philippines. It has been so for the past four and a half centuries. It is so today, it will be so forever.\r\nThis is why the government had to neutralize the attempt of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front [MILF] to amputate the southern parts of the country away from the organic whole and to convert them into an independent Muslim state. They were winning their war of territorial encroachment simply because the previous administration refused to fight, pretending that it wasn\u2019t happening. In fact, the MILF had already occupied and hoisted their flag over large territories in Mindanao\u2014in at least 46 camps\u2014under the nose of the preceding administration, which was either naive enough to tolerate them or too timid to stop them.\r\nIn contrast, my government was decisive enough to expel them. As President, I could not just stand by while the rebels ate up more and more of the country\u2019s territory they were not elected to govern. When I took office, I swore to preserve and defend the Constitution. It was my solemn duty under that Constitution to repel the armed rebellion and to defend the sovereignty and integrity of this republic. [\r\n]\r\nThe MILF could not be talked out of their position, whether territorial or ideological. They said that their goal of secession was nonnegotiable. Well, neither is the sovereignty and integrity of the republic. No one can challenge that proposition by force of arms and get away with it.\r\nIt would have been quieter if the conflict could be resolved by an exchange of words rather than by an exchange of fire. But whenever words were tried in the past, in the name of so-called peace but which in reality was appeasement, the rebels simply used the peace talks as an opportunity for arms buildup, for troop recruitment and training, for deployment, for territorial consolidation, and for enlarging their threat to the republic.\r\nThere would have been a larger space for tolerance if they had pushed their cause in the open marketplace for ideas. But instead, they built up an army and used their firepower to force their separatist aims on our unwilling people.\r\nTrue to form, the MILF took advantage of the 1997 ceasefire to commit at least 227 violations. These include the kidnapping of Father Luciano Benedetti in September 1998; the occupying and setting on fire of the municipal hall of Talayan, Maguindanao; the takeover of the Kauswagan Municipal Hall; the bombing of the Lady of Mediatrix boat at Ozamiz City; and the takeover of the Narciso Ramos Highway. By doing so, they inflicted severe damage on the country\u2019s image abroad, and scared much-needed investments away.\r\nThe numerous camps they maintained were not Boy Scout camps. They were staging areas and launching pads for expanding the MILF rebellion further. These military camps were not under the command and control of the government of the Republic of the Philippines. They owed their allegiance elsewhere.\r\nGiven all these, plus the unabated murders, terrorism, abuses, extortion, bombings, illegal control of buildings and public highways, and other atrocities committed by the rebels in the pursuit of their secessionist aims, the government was faced with two choices. One was to play the sucker, keep talkng and let the problems grow until the republic was in real mortal danger. The other was to meet force with force. An armed rebellion demanded an armed response. The sitting-duck strategy has never been known to work well \u2026 for the duck.\r\nIn order to ensure permanent peace in the future, we had to demolish the rebels\u2019 apparatus for making war. Moreover, abstention from military action would have meant political abdication.\r\nIn effect, we did not choose the military option. It was forced upon us. But we used it. And we succeeded.\r\nThe retaking of these territories was not just a symbolic victory but a substantive one. We upheld the constitutional principle that the Philippines is one state, one republic, with one government, one military answerable to one civilian Commander in Chief, under one Constitution and one flag, in one undivided territory. That is what it is now. That is what it will be forever.\r\nAng buong bansa ay nagpupugay sa kagitingan ng mga opisyal at mga kawani ng ating Sandatahang Lakas ng Pilipinas sa pamumuno ng ating kalihim ng Department of National Defense at ng ating Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Kasama ng ating mga field commanders, tinupad nila ng buong katapatan at katapangan ang kanilang tungkulin sa ating pagsakop ng mga kampo ng MILF. Let the whole country salute the Filipino soldiers who valiantly and bravely fought the rebels in defense of the sovereignty, integrity, and honor of the Republic of the Philippines. [\r\n] Let the whole country pay tribute, in particular, to those who gave up their lives or were injured fighting to preserve the unity of their motherland. Sila ay nakadagdag sa hanay ng ating mga bagong bayani.\r\nNgunit ang buong lipunan ay nakikiramay din sa mga mahal sa buhay ng mga nasawi, sa hanay ng dalawang puwersa, sibilyan man o mga sundalo. Nakikidalamhati tayo doon sa mga nasaktan at napinsala ng kaguluhang ito.\r\nNow that we have won the war, it is time to win the peace. Toward this end, the government has adopted a four-point strategy in approaching the Mindanao question from hereon.\r\nI now invite the MILF into a brotherly embrace of peace. Let us walk away from the battlefield and into the conference room. But we must do so in good faith. You must talk peace with us, not talk while preparing for war.\r\nAnd you must accept our conditions. You must drop secession, drop your criminal activities, and drop your arms.\r\nThese are not requests but demands. They are not proposals but premises. We can talk about when, where, and how, but not about whether or not. We can be flexible on timetables and methods, but not about principles.\r\nThe reasons for each demand should be obvious. I will briefly discuss them in reverse order.\r\nYou must drop your weapons because outside of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the authorized police forces, no group whatsoever has any right to maintain an armed force or military camps within the sovereign territory of this republic.\r\nSecession by itself is a mere ideology, but if backed by armed force, it becomes a rebellion. A secessionist can only argue, but a rebel can kill. The government has no choice but to disarm the rebel\u2014except for duly licensed personal firearms.\r\nYou must drop all your criminal activities because terrorism, bombings, and violence have no place in a civilized society. Criminals have no place in a negotiating table. Their place is in jail.\r\nMost of all, you must drop your secessionist goals. We do not ask that you respect and recognize the sovereignty of the republic. We demand that you do.\r\nMay I give the MILF some unsolicited advice. Secession in the Philippines is an impossible dream. There simply is no space in our geography, in our demographics, and in all our national mentality for forcibly carving another state out of the present Philippine territory. For that reason, the foreign models you invoke, like East Timor, will not work for you.\r\nPlease bear in mind that you are neither the sole occupants nor even the majority in the lands you wish to carve out to convert into your own state. There are whole Filipino populations in Mindanao\u2014Muslims, Christians, and Lumad\u2014who do not want their territories and their residences disturbed. Not even the majority of the Muslim population shares your separatist views nor the violent means you employ to attain them. The overriding passion of the people of Mindanao is for peace.\r\nAnd the international community as a whole will neither support nor sympathize with secession. In fact, we deeply appreciate the statement of the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Conference [OIC], encouraging Muslim minorities in nonmember states, and I quote:\r\nUnquote.\r\nSecession as a dream is also out of tune with history. If there is one lesson that historical evolution has taught us, it is this: That diversity is a cause for celebration, not segregation; that cultural cross-breeding leads to strength while in-breeding leads to weakness; and that cultural identities are enriched by interaction and impoverished by isolation. Some of the most glorious creations and achievements of civilization are the products of the historical confluences between Islam and Christianity.\r\nWhat we should strive for is not just peaceful coexistence but interactive harmony and constructive interdependence.\r\nWe cannot negotiate over secession. The sovereignty and the integrity of the republic are not available for compromise or trade\u2014not even for the sake of peace. Any peace won by bartering any portion of our sovereignty is an immoral peace.\r\nWe cannot talk about secession. But we can talk about a new beginning for Mindanao.\r\nIn fact, if you are bold enough for it, we can talk about a different war, a bigger war that needs to be fought. I do not mean the guerrilla warfare that you appear to have shifted to. I hope you stop\u2014for the sake of the people, especially the poor, who will suffer the most from continued hostilities. But if you decide to engage us further, we are ready for you. If you can shift strategies and tactics, so can we.\r\nWhen I talk of another war, I mean the war to correct historical wrongs, which left a sad legacy of poverty and social injustice to Mindanao. This is the war that all of us, including ex-rebels, should fight together.\r\nFighting the rebellion is one thing. It takes the military to do it. But fighting the root causes of rebellion is another. It will take the whole society to do it.\r\nWe can talk about the possibility of amnesty. I ask the MILF leaders to lead your followers in walking with us along the path of peace. On the other hand, I invite the MILF followers to walk with us in peace even if your leaders won\u2019t. Instead of the lives of hunted fugitives, you can now live the lives of peaceful farmers, fishermen, factory workers, merchants, entrepreneurs, or civil servants, or even soldiers or policemen. In short, we can talk about you reintegration into our society.\r\nWe can also talk about autonomy. On this subject, we are willing to be creative and to explore a wide range of possibilities, including radical changes in our political structure. I urge that we jointly envision and create a new order for Mindanao, which will restructure the governance, the economy, and the social environment of that island, with all its beauty and diversity.\r\nWe will convert Mindanao into the main food basket of the Philippines, into an agricultural paradise, and into a booming manufacturing base. Camp Abubakar, where the soldiers proudly raised the Philippine flag, will be developed into a special economic zone.\r\nOne thing I must emphasize, however, autonomy does not confer immunity or exemption from good governance, transparency, and accountability, particularly in the use of public funds.\r\nThe government has been providing full development support for Mindanao. From 1996, when the peace agreement was signed, up to 1999, the government poured in more than P32 billion for socioeconomic development programs into the special zone of peace and development [SZOPAD] comprising 14 provinces, as well as for the support and strengthening of the political institutions in the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao [ARMM].\r\nBut to move both the peace process and the development of Mindanao forward faster, I urge Congress to pass the bill amending the ARMM Organic Act and the bill granting special powers to enable the fast-track of development of Mindanao.\r\nOn the matter of the Abu Sayyaf, we are all happy that some hostages have been released. I wish to give assurance that the primary concern of the government is the safe release of the hostages.\r\nContrary to rebel propaganda, our fight is not against Muslims at all. They are all our brothers. Our fight is against rebels and other outlaws, regardless of their religion.\r\nThus, I wish to send a message to all Muslim Filipinos, the majority of whom share a passion for peace and renounce the separatist rebellion.\r\nMy Muslim brothers: We worship the same God\u2014the God of Abraham and Moses. You call him by his Arabic name,\r\nwhich in Filipino simply means\r\nand in English,\r\nIs He on your side or ours? Maybe neither. He is on the side of peace, and therefore on both our sides. The government invoked the Constitution when it rolled back the rebellion. Let us now invoke our common God as we build the structures of peace.\r\nAs we embark on a new beginning in Mindanao, we shall also launch a new beginning for integrity in government.\r\nIn my address to you last year, I said: \u201cHindi binebeybi and rebelyon. Pinipisa. Iyan ay aking tinupad.\u201d\r\nMore recently, I also said: \u201cI offer peace to those who want peace. But I promise defeat to those who want war. Iyan ay tinupad ko rin.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nI remind you of these statements because from the rebellion, I am shifting the war towards another enemy: graft and corruption.\r\nIto ang pangako ko sa inyo: Ito ay tutuparin ko rin. [\r\n]\r\nAng aking susunod na digmaan ay laban sa mga tiwali sa pamahalaan at sa mga tao ng pribadong sektor na nakikipagsabwatan sa kanila.\r\nGraft and corruption weakens the the moral fabric of our people, robs the poor, increases the costs of doing business, erodes tax collection efforts, and drives away investments. The World Bank estimates that at least 20 percent of government project funds ends up as kickbacks.\r\nThe World Bank, at my personal request, has conducted extensive studies which they assembled into a report entitled \u201cCombating Corruption in the Philippines\r\nIt presents an exhaustive analysis of corruption in this country, and puts forward a set of recommendations.\r\nWe can no longer fight corruption piecemeal. We need a comprehensive approach that would reduce opportunities for corruption; remove needless regulations and simplify procedures; eradicate the need to recover electoral expenses by corrupt means; increase public vigilance both to deter and to detect commissions of graft; reform budget processes; improve meritocracy in the civil service; target selected departments and agencies for cleansing; increase the efficiency and speed in catching offenders and their prosecution; stiffen sanctions against corruption partnerships with the private sector; and support judicial reform to make the courts part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The courts should not allow themselves to be used as a refuge for scoundrels.\r\nI warn all departments and agencies of government to brace themselves, especially those consistently listed in surveys and studies on government corruption.\r\nI will be submitting to Congress an urgent bill creating an anti-graft and corruption commission. This bill will provide the government with the necessary powers and resources to combat this long-festering cancer in our society. I also urge Congress to pass the anti-racketeering bill with anti-money laundering provisions.\r\nPigilin, supilin, sugpuin ang graft and corruption! [\r\n]\r\nAs the war on graft intensifies, the war on poverty continues. Our premise is that the most effective way of eradicating poverty is through sound, noninflationary growth and development. This, however, must be complemented by focused interventions that aim directly at poverty reduction. Hence, the high priority accorded by my government to agriculture and the rural areas, education, health, housing, agrarian reform.\r\nAgriculture, after a momentary dip in the first quarter from the 6 percent growth in 1999, resumed its robust performance with a 4.8 percent growth in the second quarter of this year.\r\nIn education, last year we constructed thousands of new classrooms, provided hundreds of thousands of new desks, addressed the teacher shortage problem, and proposed improvements to the curricula to meet both global standards and local needs. In partnership with the private sector, we have extended assistance to students by providing them access to the Internet.\r\nIn health, we launched a parallel importation program to bring down the market prices of medicines drastically and make them affordable to the poor.\r\nFor the 10-month period from July 1999 to May 2000, more than 190,000 households were provided with housing units. This represents 52 percent of the target households to be sheltered in Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.\r\nIn agrarian reform, our government has distributed a total of 523,000 hectares of land to 305,000 farmers.\r\nWe continued to lay the groundwork for future growth with continuing advances in the construction and completion of major roads and water supply basins, in the energizing of our barangays, 77.4 percent of which now have power, and in the exploitation of natural gas fields to reduce our dependence on imported oil.\r\nWe have been implementing the Clean Air Act, among others, by phasing out leaded gasoline in Metro Manila ahead of schedule. We have been removing massive debris from the Pasig River, including sunken vessels, and we continue rehabilitation works on Laguna Lake and its tributaries.\r\nWe terminated the customs valuation and surveillance contract with the SGS. We not only saved P4.2 billion a year in fees; we also exceeded our customs collection target by P3.7 billion without their help.\r\nWe pushed the passage of the e-Commerce Act, for which I thank Congress. This makes the Philippines only the fourth Asian country to have such a law. We are among the very few countries whose legal systems now recognize that trade and financial transactions are shifting away from the physical and the paper-based world to the rapid electronic highways of the Internet.\r\nIn our external relations, we agreed with the other ASEAN leaders to advance the full establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area. We continued to play an active role in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group [APEC], the Asia-Europe Meetings [ASEM], and the United Nations and its various agencies. To strengthen our bilateral partnerships, I visited China, Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, and Argentina the past year. Tonight, I will be leaving for my official visit to the United States.\r\nSince I last addressed you, our economy as a whole has experienced moderate growth, low inflation, low interest rates, strong exports, a healthy balance of payments, and record-high international reserves.\r\nIn 1999, our GDP grew by 3.4 percent while GNP rose by 3.7 percent. In the first quarter of the current year 2000, GDP rose by 3.4 percent and GNP by 3.45 percent. Not spectacular, but at least I would say respectable. The industry sector reversed its 3.6 percent decline in the first quarter of last year with a 4.8 percent rise in the first quarter this year.\r\nOur inflation rate was 6.6 percent in 1999, and a highly commendable 3.5 percent for the first semester of this year.\r\nInterest rates remained low. The 91-day Treasury bill rates stayed below 9 percent since the last week of June 1999. Correspondingly, commercial bank lending rates also remained soft.\r\nBecause of the rise in private consumption expenditures, the government pulled back from the pump-priming activities it had engaged in to counteract the recessionary effects of the Asian crisis. The deficit for the first five months of the current year was P34.1 billion, or P11.2 billion less than last year.\r\nExports, led by electronics and semiconductors, reached an impressive $11.3 billion in the first four months this year, 10.6 percent higher than for the same period last year.\r\nWe posted a balance of trade surplus of $732 million in the first quarter and $4.31 billion for the whole of 1999, reversing by multiples the $163 million deficit in 1998.\r\nAs a result of this, plus the remittances of our overseas Filipino workers, our gross international reserves reached an all-time high of $15.44 billion in May 2000, and are expected to rise to $17.1 billion by the end of the year.\r\nThe recent weaknesses in the foreign exchange rate of the peso cannot therefore be attributed to our macroeconomic fundamentals\r\nOur fundamentals are by any standards respectable\u2014except to those who refuse to see. In fact, barely two weeks ago, we reentered the Japanese Samurai Bond Market with a successful 5-year bond float of around $330 million.\r\nThe depreciation of the peso is the result largely of a new Asian crisis contagion: Other currencies in the region have been weakening due to political factors and the strength of the US economy and the US dollar. If the peso had not adjusted accordingly, our exports would have become less competitive. Obviously, the nervousness about the potential implications of the Mindanao conflict on the economy also contributed to the depreciation of the peso.\r\nWe were thus witness to a paradox: strong exports, large external trade and payment surpluses, and record levels of international reserves side by side with a depreciating peso.\r\nThat paradox, in fact, might be a harbinger of some dark clouds coming back. After a brief period of recovery from the financial crisis, the Asian region is suffering from a mild relapse. As mentioned, currency exchange rates are depreciating. Oil prices have gone up substantially. Unemployment is rising. And investments are nervously staying away from the East Asian region as a whole.\r\nAs we take a long, hard look at the future, what we see is the need for long, hard work ahead.\r\nUnder threat of a national and regional slowdown, we must keep working at the basics which, because they had been forgotten, led to the Asian crisis in the first place. We must keep up the pace of reforms, particularly by improving governance all around.\r\nI must confess, however, that I find the faddish word\r\nas too weak and wimpish. What I believe the Philippine economy needs is not just reforms but radical restructuring.\r\nMany are asking why is it that other Asian countries, which went through a worse crisis than we did, actually grew faster on the rebound. One reason is that we recovered from a higher base, they from a lower one. A more fundamental reason is that the very structure of the Philippine economy today was inherited from past decades of import substitution and protective policies, aggravated by economic mismanagement and corruption. Our industrial base is thin. Due to decades of neglect, our agricultural productivity is low. Our population growth rate is high. And our technology is on a catch-up mode. Rectifying these decades of historical errors and lapses will take much more than two years of any presidency.\r\nRadical restructuring entails the modernization of the economy, both physically and electronically, to make it more productive, efficient, and globally competitive. And modernization must touch not just agriculture and industry but the brains and hands of our people, to put the country squarely on the path of the information superhighway, which in turn links the world\u2019s knowledge-based economies into one vast global network.\r\nPhysically, the sunset industries we have inherited from the past must yield to the sunrise industries of the Internet age. Agriculture must go through a total technological conversion, and our education must catch up with the 21st century.\r\nIn the meantime, we must lay the basic foundations, the infrastructure, for enabling these\r\nto happen.\r\nIn fact, infrastructure is our response both to our long-term and our short-term needs. The expected slowdown in private consumption and investments must be counteracted by a new wave of pump-priming.\r\nThere are about $10.3 billion of official development assistance [ODA] available. One billion dollars of this can be readily used for the rehabilitation and development of Mindanao. We will attack the institutional defects and bureaucratic bottlenecks that have prevented the government in the past from utilizing the ODAs. It\u2019s a shame that because of the bottlenecks, the disbursements on ODA-funded projects fell to $800 million last year.\r\nThere are also development funds abroad that can be made available provided they are used for major road projects here in Luzon. These we will seek to utilize.\r\nI ask Congress to pass two vital bills: the\r\nwhich limits to the Supreme Court alone the power to issue temporary restraining orders [TROs] against government projects, and the\r\nIn addition, I ask you to approve my proposal in the 2001 budget to double the appropriations for foreign-assisted projects.\r\nAll these institutional reforms and radical restructurings, plus additional measures I will mention later, should restore and increase the country\u2019s ability to compete for investments in the future.\r\nAs we build our infrastructure, so shall we build our information superhighway. In fact, instead of just retracing the history of other faster-growing countries, we have decided to leapfrog from the so-called old economy to the new economy using information technology, including e-commerce, to fast-track our productivity and our competitiveness.\r\nIn the 1,408 remaining days of my presidency, there is more to come. Let me share with you a few highlights of my vision for the future, which consists both of continuities from the past and of quantum leaps into new beginnings.\r\nThe economy will grow by an average of 5 percent during my term. My critics say that this target is not ambitious and lower than that of our Asian neighbors. I should remind them that this growth rate is much higher than what we achieved in the past. And if I can, for the first time, defeat the boom-bust cycle, my successor will have a good shot at achieving tiger economy growth rates. (I could see the vice president\u2019s face smiling.) [\r\n]\r\nWe will concentrate on providing both socialized and affordable housing for the poor and the wage earners. Housing is a basic human need and generates employment, which is a recession antidote.\r\nWe must by all means prevent another Payatas by encouraging the reduction, segregation, recycling, and composting of garbage, and by using alternative state-of-the-art technologies.\r\nWe will continue with our program of deregulation and liberalization. We will push through with the privatization of a number of our government corporations that have been identified and prioritized.\r\nWe will convert the power sector into a competitive, market-driven industry. This aim is to ensure a higher and more reliable power supply at lower cost to commercial and residential users. Now, may I urge Congress to pass the Power Bill as a matter of high priority.\r\nWe will push through further with reforms that strengthen our institutions. In line with this, I ask Congress to pass the new Central Bank Act, which will empower the government to add to the durability and responsiveness of what already is one of the soundest banking systems in all of Asia.\r\nThe Philippines will rapidly evolve into a center for software programming and a base for hosting and providing Internet services. As we now excel in the export of electronic products and semiconductors, we are also fast becoming a major link in the limitless world of the Internet. The big players have begun to converge here, in addition to Texas Instruments in Baguio and Acer in Subic, Clark now hosts the America Online [AOL] call center. Scheduled for signing during my trip to the US are memoranda of agreement with Oracle Inc. and with Pacific Technology International, among others.\r\nThe Philippines, in other words, is fast moving from the world of \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d to the world of \u201cclicks and portals.\u201d\r\nBy linking up our schools to the world of the Internet and the cyber world, the Philippines educational system will take a giant stride in coverage and quality. Our future \u201ce-schools\u201d will be able to reach more students and provide relevant instruction.\r\nThe Philippine National Police will continue to pursue its policy of absolute zero tolerance against illegal drugs. It will also continue to professionalize itself in its no-nonsense fight against crime and lawlessness.\r\nWe will modernize the fighting capabilities of the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines, both in terms of personnel and equipment. Their outstanding performance in Mindanao further highlighted their importance in preserving the territorial integrity of the republic from external and internal threats.\r\nIn fact, we will streamline the entire government, enhance the quality of government service, and increase the efficiency by which basic services are delivered. In this connection, I call on Congress to pass the bill re-engineering the bureaucracy.\r\nBy way of electoral reform, 45 percent of all the 190,000 precincts all over the country will be computerized by the year 2001, and 100 percent by the elections of 2004. This program will speed up the counting of votes and eliminate opportunities for fraud. I will never tolerate election fraud since I was once cheated when I first ran for mayor of San Juan. And I know how it feels to be cheated. Fortunately, the Supreme Court declared me the winner.\r\nAdmittedly, over the past two years, the presidency itself has struggled through the challenges of coping with the learning curve made more difficult by the long-lasting effects on the corporate sector of the Asian financial crisis and by the vicious attempts of my detractors to discredit me and my family. These attacks started way back during my campaign and never let up. Unfortunately, by discrediting me, the head of state and of government, they also undermine the confidence of the international community in the country, and thereby damage the prospects for our economy.\r\nSa halip na tayo ay magsiraan, kailangang magkaisa at magtulungan tayo sa darating na apat na taon upang mapabilis ang ating pag-unlad. Habang tayo ay nagsisiraan at nagaaway-away, nagpapalakpakan naman ang ating karatig-bansa dahil sa kanila pumupunta ang mga dayuhang kapitalista at mga turista.\r\nNonetheless, the presidency has learned its lessons well. At this point, the presidency itself is poised for its own new beginnings. [\r\n]\r\nTo assure crystal-clear transparency in all government transactions and to remove all opportunities for abuse by all government officials, I wish to make the following announcements.\r\nAs long as I am President, there will be no negotiated contracts in all government procurements, public works, and other construction projects. We will never allow another Amari or Centennial Expo to happen ever again. [\r\n] All supply and construction contracts will be awarded through public bidding.\r\nAnd to make doubly sure that future bids will be completely transparent, the government will resort to electronic public biddings, or the so-called\r\nmethod, where bids from all suppliers and contractors will be posted on a website. This brings transparency to a new dimension.\r\nAs long as I am President, there will be no government guarantees issued on the loans of private firms. No creditors should be shielded by the government\u2019s sovereign guarantees from the market risks that they themselves should bear. The risks should not be borne by the taxpayers.\r\nThe only guarantees to be given will be under the most restrictive conditions, such as those provided by the BOT law.\r\nI shall not do to the next administration what the last one did to mine, [\r\n] namely, hand over multibillion-peso guarantees on failed negotiated projects that my administration now has to honor and pay.\r\nNo government financial institution shall extend any new loans, nor shall any government agency enter into any new contracts, with those with bad records and unresolved disputes with government.\r\nWe will further curb smuggling by rationalizing the operation of duty-free shops. We will confine them to traditional merchandise, like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes carried in plastic bags, not frozen chickens and cheese curls loaded on grocery shopping carts; where consumers can purchase chocolate bars, but not the refrigerators to store them in. Duty free-shops should not operate as supermarkets, and vice versa. [\r\n]\r\nI have ordered all the agencies concerned to carry out the investigation and, if warranted, the prosecution of those suspected of illegal involvement in the trading of shares of BW Resources. [\r\n] Incidentally, I wish to thank the honorable members of Congress for passing the new Securities Regulation Act, which provides for stronger protection of investors from fraud and which strengthens the capabilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nI hereby order the concerned agencies to resolve the air dispute with Taiwan at the shortest time possible, taking into account the interests of our OFWs, balikbayans, and tourists, as well as cargo shippers. [\r\n] We will reshape our aviation policies to promote primarily the interests of the economy.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to extend my administration\u2019s gratitude and appreciation to the honorable members of Congress for acting on a significant number of measures. You have enacted a large number of important laws affecting the economy, including the Electronic Commerce Law, the Safeguard Measures Act, the Securities Regulation Code, and the Retail Trade Liberalization Law, among others. Congress worked long and hard to deliver these measures. Alam ko pong inuumaga kayo sa inyong mga sesyon at ako po naman ay taus-pusong nagpapasalamat sa inyong lahat. [\r\n]\r\nNgunit hindi pa tayo tapos. [\r\n] May utang pa tayo sa bayan. Umaasa ako na inyong pagtitibayin ang mga panukalang batas tulad ng amendments to the ARMM Organic Act, the Power Bill, the new Central Bank Act, the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act, the Reengineering the Bureaucracy Act, the Anti-Racketeering Act, amendments to the Omnibus Investment Code, and the bill granting special powers for the fast-track development of Mindanao. [\r\n]\r\nAyan, ihinuli ko na yung special power. Hindi emergency power, special power lamang. Pero nasa inyo na \u2018yon.\r\nTo conclude, with all due candor:\r\nWe have done quite well, but we could have done better. We have gone quite far, but we are far from where we want to go. And before we can tell a story of success, we will have to go through a story of struggle. The weather ahead will be a bit rough before we get to see some real sunshine.\r\nIn the face of the difficulties we confront, I call on the whole country to work together in unison rather than to fall apart in dissension. We can ride the storm if we unite. It will blow us apart if we fight.\r\nI also call on the affluent to pay their taxes correctly. [\r\n] There is only one thing worse than not spending enough on pro-poor programs, and that is running excessive deficits and allowing inflation and macroeconomic instability to rob the poor.\r\nThe present uncertainties call for courage, and hope, and faith in our ability to cope and prevail. If we face these challenges with the proper spirit, we will survive the storm and thrive when the sunshine returns.\r\nNow that I have brought my presidency through a process of renewal, I ask you once again to give me your trust and your support. Let us leave the past with all its disappointments behind, and let us shape our future together. Let us all embark on a new beginning.\r\nAs I said earlier, there are only 1,400 days left of my presidency. Ang tunay nating kalaban ay ang kahirapan. At inaamin ko na kahit na ako ang pangulo, hindi ko kayang labanan ito nang nag-iisa. Kaya kailangan ko ang tulong ninyong lahat. [\r\n] Magkaisa na po tayo alang-alang sa ating bayan at sa ating mga anak na dapat na bigyan natin ng isang mapayapa, maunlad, at magandang kinabukasan.\r\nMaraming salamat po.

{"delivered": "1999-07-26 01:03:44+00:00", "author": "Joseph Ejercito Estrada", "text": "[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC319zzKEF0&feature=relmfu[/youtube] TRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on\u00a0July 26, 1999]\r\nI, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, President of the Republic of the Philippines, with the nation, the world, and God as my witness, do hereby reaffirm my unwavering commitment to democracy. [\r\n]\r\nI stand by my solemn oath to defend the Constitution. As President, I will always uphold freedom in all its various forms; including the freedom of speech, of the press, of worship, of assembly, and of choice. [\r\n] None of these freedoms are under threat.\r\nThose who fear the loss of freedom do not share my faith in the strength of our Constitution, in the sturdiness of our institutions, in the passion of our people to preserve their freedom, and in their determination and power to defend it. Freedom may have been lost before. It will never be lost again. [\r\n] Our people will see to that. I as president will stake my own life on it. [\r\n]\r\nYet may I remind our people that liberty without responsibility is license, that freedom does not confer the right to violate the law or the rights of others, that freedom without responsibility is the formula for chaos, anarchy, and lawlessness.\r\nThe paranoid will take that last statement as a hidden threat. The rest will see it as a self-evident principle, accepted throughout the ages, and needing neither apology nor defense. Yet, given a choice between freedom and restraint, I will choose to err on the side of freedom. [\r\n]\r\nTo paraphrase Voltaire: I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. But that does not mean I waive the right to argue with you! That is as much my constitutional right as it is yours.\r\nLet all doubts be erased. Democracy, freedom, and the Constitution are alive and well in this country. [\r\n]\r\nNow, to other issues.\r\nAlthough I am blessed with many friends, I have no cronies. [\r\n]\r\nI have turned down, and will continue to turn down, all requests for a government bailout of financially strapped companies, as I did in the case of Philippine Airlines, owned by Mr. Lucio Tan. [\r\n]\r\nThe sequestered shares of Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. in San Miguel Corporation are under litigation and will stay as such until the case is resolved. There is no deal involved here with Mr. Cojuangco.\r\nThe extradition process involving Mr. Mark Jimenez will proceed in accordance with the due process of law, without obstruction.\r\nThere are no secret deals with the Marcoses.\r\nI hope this answers your immediate concerns.\r\nNgayon, handa na ba kayong makinig sa akin? [\r\n]\r\nAko\u2019y nagagalak ipahayag sa inyo na ang ating bansa ay nakaahon na sa krisis ng Asia.\r\nIto ang isa sa maraming dahilan kung bakit dapat natin ipagdiwang ang unang kaarawan ng aking administrasyon.\r\nSa aking inagurasyon sa Luneta noong ika-30 ng Hunyo 1998, mahigpit kong iginiit na \u201cHuwag n\u2019yo akong susubukan!\u201d [\r\n] Nguni\u2019t ang sumubok sa akin ay hindi ang taong-bayan kundi ang matinding bagyo na tumama sa ating ekonomiya.\r\nNang ako\u2019y hinirang na maging kapitan ng barko ng ating sambayanan, ito ay kasalukuyang palubog na sa maalong dagat ng Asian crisis. Sabi ko sa aking sarili: ang ganda naman ng timing ng aking pagsakay. Hinahampas ng hangin at alon ang barko. At lalong masama, kakaunti na lang ang gasolina ng kanyang tangke. Paano natin ngayon dadalhin ang barkong ito sa ligtas na lugar hanggang makalipas ang malupit na panahon?\r\nMabuti na lamang, ang aming team ng mga kilalang dalubhasa sa kanya-kanyang linya ay nagkaisa sa pagpapasya kung paano lulutasin ang mga problema na ating hinaharap noon. Sa pamamagitan ng aming pagtutulungan, pagsisikap, at mga tamang pamamalakad, napaayos namin ang paggalaw ng barko. Nang sumikat ang araw, ang karamihan ng mga ibang barko ay nakalubog pa rin at nagsisikap pang umahon, ngunit ang barko ng Pilipinas ay nakalutang na sa liwanag ng araw.\r\nNgayon, marami na ang nakakargang gasolina sa ating barkong Pilipinas, dahil nais nilang sumama sa ating paglakbay sa darating na milenio. Malayo na ang kaya nating maabot. Kaya tayo ay susulong na ngayon!\r\nToday, I fulfill my Constitutional mandate to address Congress on the first day of its regular session. By tradition, I am to dwell on the State of the Nation.\r\nLet me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or wished to see me fail. I am sorry to disappoint them. [\r\n]\r\nI am pleased to report that our nation is rising, growing, and strengthening. This is in contrast to the situation I described to you last year, and which I vowed to reverse. Ako\u2019y natutuwang ipahayag na ang ating bayan ay umaangat, umuunlad, at lumalakas. Ito ay kabaligtaran ng kalagayan ng ating ekonomiya na aking binigkas dito noong nakaraang taon. Nakaraan na ang krisis ng ekonomiya.\r\nLast year, when I first addressed this august body, our nation was in an economic crisis. Today, we are out of it.\r\nLast year, I told you that our aim was to help the country escape the recession. We did it.\r\nIn 1998, most of our Asian neighbors sank into recession. In contrast, our country managed a modest but positive growth of one-tenth of one percent [0.1%] in our gross national product [GNP]. However, our gross domestic product [GDP] dipped by one-half of one percent [0.5%] during the year. In the first quarter of this year, our GNP abruptly surged upward by 2% and our GDP by 1.2%. Last year, we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking. Today, we are sailing towards the high seas again.\r\nIt is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of Filipinos: our overseas workers. They as a group kept our GNP growth at positive rates even during the worst of times. They continue to be our economic saviors.\r\nLast year, I expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a single-digit rate. We did it.\r\nIn 1998, the inflation rate was at a full-year average of 9.7%. It improved further to a six-month average of 8.4% in the first half of 1999. In June alone, inflation was down to 5.8%. Inflation is a vicious enemy of the poor.\r\nLast year, I said that without undermining the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we would support the lowering of interest rates. We did it.\r\nIn the past 12-month period alone, the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate dropped steeply from 14.9% on the first auction on July 6, 1998, to 8.4% last Monday. This is its lowest level in more than 12 years. Bank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels.\r\nLast year, I lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing burdens on our people. I inferred that we should strengthen our currency. We did it.\r\nAt the beginning of 1998, the peso plunged to an all-time low of P45.42 to $1. At the beginning of my administration, it was at P42.04. Since then, the peso has strengthened dramatically. It has stabilized within a range of P37 to P39 to the dollar. This was achieved largely by leaving the market alone. And the market responded with a show of confidence: it sent billions of dollars of loans, investments, and export orders to the Philippines. The Bangko Sentral intervened only occasionally to prevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks, not to set the trends or levels of the exchange rate.\r\nLast year, I committed to more effective and efficient tax collection. We did it.\r\nDespite the ravages of the Asian crisis on tax collections, total revenues amounted to P462 billion in 1998, of which tax revenues constituted P416 billion, or P4 billion higher than in 1997. For the first four months of 1999, BIR collections reached P126 billion, or 3.2% higher than in 1998. Customs collections amounted to P23.1 billion, and nontax revenues, P14.1 billion.\r\nThis does not mean that we are happy with our tax effort. We need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax structure itself, and hence our existing tax laws.\r\nLast year, we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the public had been made to believe. We committed to reduce the government deficit. This time, we didn\u2019t do it.\r\nIt is not that we failed. We deliberately shifted course.\r\nAt a time when the economy was threatened by recession, the previous administration had decided on a 25% across-the-board forced savings on the expenditures of the government. This was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to a patient with low blood pressure. Lalong lulubha ang pasyente, at baka mamatay ng hindi oras. (That is why my favorite doctor, The First Lady, always makes sure that my blood pressure is normal, especially when I\u2019m reading the newspapers.) [\r\n] [\r\n]\r\nWe scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite. We not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate levels; we also engaged in various pump-priming. Our aim was not to save but to spend. This was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and investment expenditures. In other words, to raise the country\u2019s declining blood pressure rather than let it sink further.\r\nOur logic was simple. A time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced budgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation. But a time of recession and deflation calls for budget deficits to jumpstart a recovery.\r\nThus, towards the end of 1998, we increased the budget deficit to P50 billion, or 1.8% of the GNP. For the first time, and for the first five months of 1999, we incurred, as planned, a deficit of P45.3 Billion, still within the 1999 programmed deficit of P68.4 billion (or 2.2% of target GNP). For the next two years, we intend to reduce our deficit to 1.1% and 0.4% of GNP, and eventually attain a balanced budget in the year 2002 and surpluses thereafter. In other words, I will not end my term with a deficit. [\r\n]\r\nOne problem we faced was how to finance the deficit. Borrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when we wanted them to go down. Borrowing abroad was too costly. Monetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the peso. Foreign exchange controls were untenable. Raising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to a deep recession.\r\nIt seemed like there was no way out. But we found one anyway. Substantial funds were located right under our noses\u2014the Foreign Currency Deposit Units, or FCDUs\u2014so we borrowed from them, on a short-term basis, at relatively low cost.\r\nAs a result, we brought down interest rates. We brought down the inflation rate. And we strengthened the peso. Experts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they are inconsistent with one another. But we did it. And we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most of our neighbors.\r\nI narrate all these \u201cinside stories\u201d to make a point. Those who make a career and a business out of hitting me are saying that the improvement in the country\u2019s economic performance was due to pure luck, to good weather, or to anything but Erap. Tsamba lang daw. Sa madali\u2019t salita, kung gumaganda ang takbo ng ekonomiya, walang kinalaman si Erap. Ngunit kung bumagsak ang ekonomiya, kasalanan ni Erap. Mali naman yata iyan. Our recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations and made bold decisions.\r\nOur success was the result of effective governance. It was a matter of having the right policies, being supported by competent and dedicated cabinet members, respecting the freedom of the market, managing and budgeting our resources right, and acting quickly before the danger grew or the opportunity disappeared.\r\nAs a prominent Filipino economist, Dr. Bernardo Villegas, recently wrote\u2014and I quote\u2014\u201dThe economic team of the present administration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness, effectiveness, and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams during the first years of [the previous administrations] \u2026 President Estrada\u2019s first economic team is among the best in Asia.\u201d [End of quote]\r\nEffective governance by a team-powered administration also explains the rapid recovery of the country\u2019s international credit standing. I am sure you know the definition of a banker: He is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining. Credit markets are even more jittery.\r\nSo when the global market gobbles up $1.2 billion worth of the Republic of the Philippines Global Bonds for budget support, from the first country to float such an issue after the Asian crisis; and when the market buys up the $400 million of Bangko Sentral bonds issued for reserve management purposes; and when the Eurobond flotation of the national government raises $383 million\u2014the world believes that in the Philippines, it has stopped raining. We are getting a shower of umbrellas!\r\nThis is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in medium- and long-term loans from bilateral sources, banks, and financial institutions; from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank; from Japan\u2019s Export-Import Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund; and from the International Monetary Fund, among others.\r\nIsa pang tanda ng pagbangon ng ating ekonomiya ay ang pagbaba ng unemployment rate mula 13.3% noong Abril nang nakaraang taon hanggang 11.8% nitong nakaraang Abril dahil sa 1.6 million bagong trabahong nalika. Gagawin namin ang lahat para ibaba ang unemployment rate sa less than 10% sa susunod na taon at sa around 6.7% bago magtapos ang aking administrasyon. [\r\n] Ang ating target ay makalikha nang mula sa 6 million hanggang 6.4 million trabaho sa buong panahon ng akng panunungkulan. [\r\n]\r\nIn the meantime, our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates, our balance of current accounts are in surplus, and our gross international reserves are at all-time highs, currently amounting to $14 billion.\r\nWith all these developments, it is no wonder that in the space of only one year, the other Asian countries and, indeed, much of the world, have come to recognize the presidency of the Philippines as among the leaders of the region. This is indeed a long way from the skepticism that greeted this presidency when it began. In APEC, in ASEAN, and in other regional and international forums, the current leadership of the Philippines enjoys a high level of respect. Our international prestige is on the rise. The dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of confidence. And the people, according to the latest surveys, give the president a 77.6% approval rating.\r\nThe heads of the IMF and the World Bank also have had good words to say. Mr. James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u201dWhat is clear is the Philippine situation is vastly different from Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia \u2026 I think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone else in the region with the exception of Singapore.\u201d End of quote. And Mr. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said he considered the Philippines as a model for countries in the ASEAN region.\r\nOnly last Thursday, the IMF Executive Board completed the fourth review under our standby arrangement. This will now allow us to draw about $214 million, which will further increase our gross international reserves. The IMF executive directors also praised the Bangko Sentral, headed by Governor Gabriel Singson, for the successful implementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two years.\r\nIt is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press give good reviews of our performance, and while investors pour money into our economy, some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our country. Samantalang ang mga dayuhang ekonomista at manunulat ay pinupuri ang pag-ahon ng ating ekonomiya, ang ilan naman sa ating mga peryodista ay siyang unang sumisira dito ng walang basehan.\r\nIn the past year, the main imperative that faced us was to survive the crisis. Now, we turn to pursuing our vision.\r\nThere are those, in fact, who say that we have no vision. They claim, for example, that we have no programs to fight poverty: the central pledge of my campaign. they are wrong. It is not the government that is lacking in programs. It is our critics who are lacking in perception. it is not I who has no vision. It is they who have no insight.\r\nI consider poverty an intolerable social shame. It cries out not for marginal attention but for a total approach. For me, the war on poverty is not just a policy but a passion. I deplore the fact that the past economic programs of this country were mostly upside-down. Baligtad. They aimed at developing the apex and neglected the base.\r\nMy own belief is the opposite. Uplifting the rich leaves the poor behind. But uplifting the poor lifts everyone, including the rich.\r\nLet me make this clear. My vision is not just the alleviation of poverty but its ultimate eradication. Alleviation is temporary. Eradication is permanent. Alleviation is limited. Eradication is total. The proper response to the problem of poverty is not superficial treatment but total structural change. Hindi maaring puksain ang kahirapan sa pamamagitan ng patapal-tapal at papahid-pahid lamang. Kailangan ay baguhin ang buong sistema.\r\nI realize that \u201ceradication\u201d is unattainable in real life. But getting as close to it as possible is worth the effort. It is true that Jesus Christ said: \u201cThe poor you will always have with you,\u201d but he did not say they had to be the majority. My vision is to drive poverty away from the center and into the periphery of our concerns, to make it a marginal rather than a mainstream problem.\r\nHence, our war on poverty is not just one program of government. It is the overriding business of the government itself. It is built into and embedded in our total economic and social programs. It defines and drives the substance, the content, and the heart and soul of our entire strategy of government.\r\nAng ating kampanya laban sa kahirapan ay hindi isang programa lamang ng pamahalaan. Ito ang sentro ng patakaran at pagkilos ng pamahalaan. Nakatatak ito sa kabuuan ng bawat programang pangkabuhayan at panlipunan. Ito ang magbibigay-buhay at lakas sa diwa at puso ng pagkilos at pamamalakad ng pamahalaan.\r\nIt is essential for our war on poverty that the economy develop in general, but this is not enough. It is also important that development efforts be redirected towards the poor, towards the base of our society. In my 30 years of public service, I have always decided for the greater good of the greatest number. With this conviction, I can never go wrong.\r\nFor example, our war on poverty is in the fundamental and strategic shift of focus of the government towards agriculture and the development of the rural areas, where two-thirds of our poor people live.\r\nAng ating pagkilos para maging moderno ang ating agrikultura\u2014para tumaas ang ani ng ating mga bukirin at pangingisda at dumami ang mga industriya sa kanayunan\u2014ay isang paraang hindi pa nasubukang gawin ng alin mang administrasyon. Nakapaloob dito ang paglalaan ng sapat na pondo para sa produksiyon ng pagkain, food security, irigasyon, farm-to-market roads, at postharvest facilities. Nitong nakaraang taon, nabigyan natin ng patubig ang mahigit 20,000 ektarya ng lupa at nakapagtayo tayo ng 250 kilometro ng farm-to-market roads. Sisiguruhin nating makakuha ng tulong pinansyal ang ating mga magsasaka, mangingisda, at maliliit na negosyante. Palalawakin natin ang mga lupang sakop ng irigasyon mula 47.2% noong 1998 hanggang 63% sa taong 2004.\r\nThis past year, we laid the foundation for the full implementation of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act. This law aims at transforming our agriculture and fisheries into technologically advanced and globally competitive sectors. Recently, I ordered that the importation of equipment, machinery, fertilizers, and other inputs of agriculture be allowed at zero tariff, as authorized by this law. [\r\n] This coming year, our proposed budget will provide a P21.8 billion fund to support the implementation of this act.\r\nOur war on poverty is also in the emphasis on expanding the linkages between farms and markets, and between rural and urban areas, through roads, power, transport, telecommunications, and other infrastructure. Last year, we built or upgraded 582 kilometers of roads and 10,069 lineal meters of bridges. We provided electricity to 1,221 barangays. We installed 165,000 new telephone lines. Our target is to see 100% of our national arterial roads paved and 100% of our bridges made permanent by the end of my term. We will upgrade our ports to international standards, and develop 36 feeder ports.\r\nOur war on poverty is in the acceleration of the land redistribution processes under the agrarian reform program. We distributed more than 266,000 hectares of land to 175,000 landless farmers, including land owned by the traditional rural elite. [\r\n]\r\nOur war on poverty is in the restructuring of our health programs to lower the price of medicines and to provide preferential attention to the indigents.\r\nIt is also in the highly augmented flow of budgetary funds to the local government units [LGUs]. As a single recipient unit, LGUs will get a total of P131.2 billion, or 20.1%, of the P651 billion budget we will propose.\r\nOur war on poverty is in the massive portion of our budget\u2014amounting to P118 billion for the year 2000\u2014that we give to education and to the programs we are undertaking to meet our increasing need for classrooms, desks, books, and teachers. Our longer-term aim is to increase the overall standards of excellence of our entire educational system.\r\nOur war on poverty is in our initiatives to provide more resources for socialized housing for the poor. From July 1998 to March 1999, we provided 127,886 units of housing assistance which benefited some 74,000 households. We intend to provide decent housing for our teachers, policemen, and soldiers.\r\nOur war on poverty is in the provision of more resources and revitalized programs to uplift and improve the welfare of women, the youth, the indigenous communities, the disabled, and the elderly, and other disadvantaged sectors of our society.\r\nOur war on poverty is in our program to moderate the growth of the population, which is presently the highest in Southeast Asia. It is in our efforts to protect the environment to ensure that our development is sustainable. One landmark achievement here is the passage by Congress of the Clean Air Act.\r\nOur war on poverty is invading even the capital market. It is in the issuance of small-denominated government bonds that allow small savers to contribute to national development while earning interest at higher rates than the banks would pay them.\r\nWe will propose certain changes in our tax laws to make our financial markets more efficient and to bring down transaction costs. The documentary stamp tax on quick-turnover transactions will be abolished. The gross receipts tax on banks and financial institutions will be removed to reduce intermediation costs. And the availment of write-offs on loan loss reserves will be accelerated.\r\nOur war on poverty is particularly intense in the obsessive efforts of the government to promote and encourage investments, both domestic and foreign. Here, another basic pro-poor shift is taking place. We are reorienting our preferences towards industries, enterprises, and technologies that employ people as against those that require capital. This is only logical, considering that we are a labor-abundant and a capital-short country. Small- and medium-scale industries will take centerstage. One of our important thrusts is a program called DRIVE, or Developing Rural Industries and Village Enterprises.\r\nAll these shifts will take place in a free market environment. all investments in industries, whether large or small, upstream or downstream, capital- or labor-intensive, will be welcome. But special attention will be placed on \u201cunblocking\u201d investments in small- and medium-scale industries, especially in the rural areas. There are many obstacles in our laws and in our landscape that impede the spontaneous flow of investments and technology into these industries. These obstacles will be removed by programs that will open up and make markets more efficient: whether by legislation, by policy and regulation revamps, by focused infrastructure construction, or by other means.\r\nInvestments create jobs. And jobs provide both income and dignity. They are the decisive eliminators of poverty.\r\nOur war on poverty is in our programs to enable our industries to achieve global competitiveness. We will transform the power sector to a market-based, competitive industry in order to lower the costs of power. The Omnibus Power Bill is necessary to achieve this. We will exploit our competitive advantage in high-tech industries. Our science and technology policies are being reoriented towards satisfying the needs of the underprivileged.\r\nLet us face up to the fact that certain provisions in our present Constitution are obsolete and serve as deterrents to our global competitiveness. In the race with the rest of the world market to the coming millennium, we cannot afford to let our Constitution bind our feet. [\r\n]\r\nIt is now time for us to identify which parts need to be improved. Some are economic; they should be made effective as soon as possible. Some are political; they should be rewritten in a way that will not allow the incumbent officials to benefit from them. [\r\n] Changing the Constitution is not about extending the terms of office of incumbents.\r\nBut let us not allow our paranoid fears to block the convening of an appropriate assembly or convention to rewrite our charter. Let us not prejudge its outcome. Our citizens can always make their voices heard during the amendment process. And ultimately, they will exercise the power, in a plebiscite, to ratify the new charter or to reject it.\r\nOur Constitution must be made to adapt to the dynamics and imperatives of global realities.\r\nEven our relationships with foreign lands are linked to developing our hinterlands. Our foreign policy is based on three pillars: the preservation of our territorial integrity and national security, the promotion of development through economic diplomacy, and the protection of the rights and welfare of our overseas nationals. Our participation, and leadership roles, in ASEAN, APEC, ASEM, the UN, and other forums are aimed at promoting stability, peace, free and fair trade, and other beneficial arrangements for the country, the region, and the world.\r\nOur war on poverty is good economics. Its success will benefit the middle and upper classes as well. The more incomes the poor earn, the greater the domestic market for business. The more capable the poor are, the greater the supply of manpower needed by business.\r\nGaya ng sinabi ko kanina, kung iaangat natin ang mayayaman, ang mahihirap ay maiiwan. Ngunit kung iaangat natin ang mahihirap, ang lahat ay aangat.\r\nI do not presume that we will reduce poverty during my term from a major to a marginal problem. But we do aspire to reduce it substantially: from an incidence of over 32% today to a range of 25% to 28% by 2004. In other words, we seek to lift more than 3.9 million Filipinos out of poverty during my term. We also hope to lay the foundations and launch the initiatives that will make the process irreversible even beyond my term.\r\nHowever, as eradication proceeds, alleviation continues. As the cancer is being removed, its pains are being relieved. Alleviation takes many forms, including social welfare services, assistance for street children, senior citizens welfare programs, relief from disasters, resettlements, and help for the disabled and the disadvantaged.\r\nIsa pang bahagi ng ating kampanya laban sa kahirapan ay ang isaayos ang pamamalakad ng pamahalaan. Ang hangad natin ay mabawasan ang aksaya at madagdagan ang serbisyong tinatanggap ng ating mga mamamayan. Unang-una na rito ang pagsugpo sa graft and corruption. Ang bawat pisong nawawala sa anomalya ay pisong ninanakaw mula sa mahihirap. Ninanakaw ng mga nagsasamantala ang mga pakinabang na sana\u2019y mapupunta sa mga taongbayan tulad ng mas maraming eskwelahan, mas maraming libro, mas maraming kalye, mas murang gamot, at mas maraming pasilidad sa pag-utang.\r\nIt is also time to put the so-called Marcos wealth in the service of the economy, of the people, and particularly of the poor. Twelve years are enough time to know the difference between the ideal and the feasible. It is also more than enough time to place evidence entirely out of reach of even the most diligent discovery efforts.\r\nWe do not know the size of the Marcos wealth. And no judgment has ever been rendered that any of it is ill-gotten. Shall we wait forever?\r\nThe more we wait, the more the returns on their wealth accrue to the Marcoses and the foreign banks, and none to the Filipino people. The earlier we acquire a substantial part of it, the sooner the returns accrue to the country.\r\nAny transfers of the Marcos wealth will augment the country\u2019s resources for fighting poverty.\r\nAng isa pang balakid sa digmaan laban sa karalitaan, at sa kaunlaran ng buong bayan, ay ang rebelyon ng ilan sa ating mga kababayan. Sila\u2019y matagal nang iniwan ng kanilang mga lider upang magpasarap sa ibang bansa, at doon nila tinutulak ang \u201cinsurgency by remote control.\u201d\r\nAko\u2019y nakikiusap sa mga rebeldeng naiwan dito. Hindi tayo magkalaban. Kung ang layunin ninyo ay ang kapakanan ng masa, heto ang masasabi ko sa inyo: Laging kasama ninyo si Erap sa pagmamalasakit sa masa. Kailanman ay hindi ko kayo iiwanan. Kaya magsamasama na tayo.\r\nHinahangad namin ang kapayapaan. Sa halip ng pag-uusap sa ibang bansa o \u201cneutral territory,\u201d ilagay natin ang peace process sa tamang lugar: sa community level. The Local Peace Forum, where established, are addressing directly the issues and concerns on the ground which are considered the causes of insurgency.\r\nNgunit mabuti na ring maliwanag ang usapan. Kuwentas klaras. Kakaunti na lang ang panahon at pasiyensiya na nalalabi sa pagdadada. Isuko na ninyo ang inyong armas. Bumalik na kayo sa buklod ng batas at ng ating lipunan, At dito tayo mag-usap ng masinsinan, bilang magkakapatid, walang sandata sa kamay, walang tutukan ng baril.\r\nOur people overwhelmingly support our constitutional system and our functioning democracy. No insurgency of any color has the legal, political, or moral right to seek to bring it down.\r\nThis government was elected by the people. It enjoys their support. Your rebellion does not. And this government was not elected to compromise the sovereignty of this Republic, not in substance, not in symbol, not ever.\r\nIf you wish to run the government, seek the people\u2019s mandate. If you have any grievances against the government or against society, seek your redress within the law. You have a right to your beliefs, but you cannot justify your belligerence.\r\nPeace we offer to you, but appeasement, never. It is the weak that offers appeasement to the strong, not vice versa. Do not doubt our resolve. We will welcome you back at any time. But we will give your rebellion no air to breathe, no space to move, no time to prosper. If you accept peace, you will have it. If you do not, we will force it anyway.\r\nThe rebellion, we must crush. [\r\n] The rebels, we must save, unless they persist in their rebellion. Those who refuse to be saved will invite the full force of our laws and the full might of our forces.\r\nHindi binebeybi ang rebelyon. Pinipisa. [\r\n] [\r\n] Kaya, huwag n\u2019yo kaming hamunin!\r\nGayon din ang masasabi ko tungkol sa krimen at mga salarin. Hindi nilalambing ang krimen. Dinudurog. Hindi kinukupkop ang kriminal. Pinaparusahan. Lalung-lalo na iyong mga nagtutulak ng bawal na gamot sa ating mga kababayan. [\r\n] Sitenta porsiyento ng krimen ay nagmumula sa paggamit ng droga. I am happy to report, however, that our efforts at fighting crime have resulted in remarkable reductions in criminal activity, thanks to the vigilance of our crime-fighting agencies at all levels. still, one crime committed is one crime too many.\r\nOur initiatives to bring about stability in Mindanao are directly related to poverty elimination. We will build up Mindanao as the country\u2019s food basket. [\r\n] But we can only succeed if an environment of political tranquility is established there. The proposed plebiscite on the expansion of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao and the subsequent elections are large steps towards stability in that all-important island.\r\nTo assure internal and external security, and to preserve the environment of stability the country needs to prosper, we will pursue the 15-year modernization program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. [\r\n] We intend to make our military and police forces among the most modern in the region.\r\nThat is the vision. That is the strategy. But as one famous architect said, \u201cgod is in the details.\u201d The concrete specifics that will make our vision real are contained in the array of plans, programs, and projects to be implemented in the next five years by various government departments, agencies, and corporations, and by local government units.\r\nI cannot in this address enumerate them all. They will be presented in more detail, first, in our forthcoming \u201cMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1999 to 2004,\u201d which we will call \u201cAngat Pinoy 2004\u201d; second, in the P621 billion budget for the year 2000, which I am submitting to Congress today; and third, in our legislative agenda. The list of our proposed bills will also be submitted to Congress today, together with the printed version of this address.\r\nI earnestly ask our legislators to support us by passing these bills, and by harmonizing every appropriations act they will pass with \u201cAngat Pinoy 2004.\u201d\r\nOur vision is coherent and clear. I wonder why some observers fail to perceive it. Please don\u2019t get shocked if I quote from the scriptures; I believe the answer is there\u2014and I quote: \u201cThey look but do not see, and hear but do not listen.\u201d End of quote. By the way, that was from Matthew.\r\nThe English author, George Moore, was right when he said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u201dThe lot of critics is to be remembered by what they failed to understand.\u201d End of quote.\r\nWe have gone a long way, but with the help of many. The local government units at all levels are indispensable partners in the strengthening of our economy and our society. The nongovernmental organizations and people\u2019s organizations are helping to deepen and expand the foundations of our development on the ground. The private sector\u2014whether engaged in business, education, health, and other forms of services\u2014have been a principal source of energy for our survival, recovery, and growth.\r\nAnd of course, I wish to express my appreciation for the contribution and support of Congress. I can only hope that the productivity of the legislative process will multiply in this coming session. Your powers and ours may be separate, as mandated by the Constitution, but our concern for our people should converge.\r\nTo sum up: We have emerged from the Asian crisis. We are now in pursuit of our vision of a prosperous and a poverty-free Philippines. The future is for us to shape.\r\nThe conditions are positive. Our exports are surging up. Our rice and corn harvests are bountiful. Our banking system is among the strongest in Asia. The peso is stable. Interest rates are low and inflation is low. The figures for the second quarter are not yet out, but I am confident that our GNP will grow by at least 2.4% and our GDP by at least 2%.\r\nOur markets are freer, our institutions stronger, our policies more supportive of growth, our people better prepared than ever.\r\nWe are now poised to fly and\u2014as we used to say in the old school\u2014fly high. The skies are there for us to conquer. All we need is to unite.\r\nAs to those who continue to distract me from pursuing my vision, I take my cue from Abraham Lincoln, who said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u201dIf I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what\u2019s said against me won\u2019t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.\u201d End of quote.\r\nAccording to the surveys, millions of Filipinos are saying I am right. Between Lincoln\u2019s ten angels and the millions of my own countrymen, I choose to believe my countrymen. [\r\n]\r\nSa ngayon, ang ating ekonomiya ay unti-unti nang nakakaahon. Ngunit marami pang hamon ang hinaharap ng ating bansa ngayon at sa darating na siglo. Malawak at malalim ang mga programang dapat natin ipatupad upang maiangat sa kahirapan ang karamihan sa ating mga kababayan.\r\nAlam ko na sa bawat kilos at hakbang na aking gagawin ay magiging matindi ang mga paninira, ang mga batikos, ang mga insulto, at mga paratang. Ngunit ang isasagot ko sa kanila ay marangal at matapat na paninilbihan dahil ang aking pakikinggan ay ang daing ng higit na nakakarami, at hindi ang ingay ng iilang may pansariling interes. [\r\n] Para sa akin, ito ang mabigat na hamon sapagka\u2019t ang kapalit nito ay ang kinabukasan ng ating lipunan.\r\nMuli, ako\u2019y nananawagan sa lahat ng ating mga kababayan na tayo ay magkaisa at magsikap para sa ating kaunlaran, katahimikan, at magandang kinabukasan.\r\nMaraming salamat po sa inyong lahat!

Thank you ladies and gentlemen.\r\nVice President Joseph Estrada; Senate President Ernesto Maceda and Speaker Jose de Venecia; the distinguished members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; honorable members of the Supreme Court and of the judiciary; Your Excellency Archbishop Gian Vincenso Moreni, Dean, and their excellencies of the diplomatic corps and the heads of international organizations; the ladies of the Tenth Congress of the Office of the President and of the Office of the Vice President; my colleagues in the Cabinet; leaders and representatives of nongovernment organizations and of the basic sectors of our civil society; the leaders of business; local government executives; the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the major service commanders; the Chief of the Philippine National Police; fellow workers in government; ladies and gentlemen:\r\nMga mahal na kapatid at mga kababayan, mga kagagalang-galang na bumubuo sa Ika-Sampung Kongreso: Ito na po ang aking huling pagkakataon na mag-uulat sa kapulungang ito hinggil sa kalagayan ng ating bansa. Mga kasama, maaari ring ito na ang huling pagkakataon para sa maraming kagawad ng Ika-Sampung Kongreso na makinig sa ganitong pag-uulat.\r\nThis is the last time I shall be reporting to this legislature on the state of the nation. It may also be the last time many of you in the Tenth Congress will listen to a State of the Nation Address from within these sacred halls. As we wind up, it is time we examine our political consciences by asking ourselves the bottom-line questions:\r\nTo these questions, self-serving answers will never be acceptable to political opinion. As for my administration, we are content\u2014in any judgment of its record so far\u2014to stand on the evidence of the economic and social indicators, the testimony of the experts, and best of all, the verdict of ordinary people.\r\nLet us look at the key indicators over these past five years.\r\nWe have come a long way in stabilizing prices. Inflation is down, from 18.7% in 1991 to 4.6% this June. And this rate is well within the ASEAN norm, and we will remain well within single-digit in 1997. In 1992 our exports increased by 4.3% compared to their value in 1991. By 1996 our exports were expanding by 23.9% over those of the previous year.\r\nIn 1992, 781,000 new jobs were created. In 1996, almost double that number were generated\u2014close to 1.5 million jobs\u2014reducing the national unemployment rate from 9.8% to 8.6%. From 1993 to 1996, we helped 763,000 families own their own homes. And by June 1998, we shall have provided housing assistance to our targeted 1.2 million families including those in Smokey Mountain, those along \u201c\r\n\u201d and those on top of the Pasig River. [\r\n] Over the same period, we shall have distributed lands to 1.5 million farmers under our Agrarian Reform Program. In health, life expectancy increased from 62.5 years in 1992 to 69.5 years in 1997. And over the same period, the infant mortality rate declined from 53.6 to 45.8 for every 1,000 live births. And functional literacy increased from 75.2% in 1989 to 83.8% in 1994.\r\nThe sum of all of these indicators of development is that, over these past five years, poverty has declined\u2014from 40% of all Filipino families in 1991 to 35% in 1994; and this targeted to go further down to 30% by next year when the next universal measurement shall be made. The results of the administration\u2019s liberalization and deregulation program have been particularly gratifying. For example, in place of a monopoly in telecommunications, we now have nine major players with more wanting to come in. This has improved the national telephone density from 79 persons per telephone line 1992 to 19 per one line as of June 1997 or a 450% increase. In interisland shipping, we have many new routes and 556 new vessels. In civil aviation, we have more airlines, more flights, more routes, better service, and lower fares. And two years ago, we had all of five Internet service providers. Now we have 115.\r\nLet us now turn to the judgment of the experts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) pronounces our country\u2019s macroeconomic situation to be \u201cvery sound\u201d\u2014except for the lack of a few but critical components in the legislative program\u2014specifically, the completion of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP), which we urgently need in order to exit from the IMF umbrella. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD), the exclusive club of 29 rich countries, last February, invited the Philippines to take part regularly in the group\u2019s dialogue with the so-called Dynamic Non-Member Economies. And the major international rating agencies are expected to upgrade the Philippines to investment grade over the next 12 months. And top executives in 10 Asian countries\u2014responding to a recent survey by the Far Eastern Economic Review, said they expect the Philippines to be the third best-performing East Asian Economy in East Asia in 1997\u2014after China and Malaysia. Yet the ultimate judge of how well a pair of shoes is made is not the shoemaker\u2019s opinion, but the customer whose feet will hurt if the shoe pinches. And the ultimate measure of how well government works is in ordinary people\u2019s own judgment of how its workings have affected their daily lives.\r\nAnd so how many Filipinos have benefited personally from the programs of the Ramos administration? The prestigious survey institution, the Social Weather Station (SWS) which all presidentiables for 1998 want to quote\u2014asking its respondents this key question\u2014got this short answer: SWS says, two-thirds (65%) of Filipinos testified that they have benefited personally from this administration\u2019s policies. [\r\n] Reporting on the SWS survey results on July 7, 1997, SWS summarized the significance of these findings in three points:\r\nSo, as we can see, all three: the socioeconomic indicators, the testimony of the experts, and the verdict of ordinary Filipinos agree that these past five years have made a difference in the lives of our people. But to me, these indicators signify not just incremental changes but a qualitative transformation of our and of our people country. In their totality, they tell us the Philippines is no longer trapped in its old cycle of boom and bust. And best of all, they prove to us our problems do not arise out of some deeply rooted cultural flaw\u2014not out of a so-called \u201c\r\n\u201c\u2014but from policy mistakes that our due diligence during the last five years and from hereon as well as political will can correct. That past is now over; and a great era dawns upon us and a greater Filipino future beckons.\r\nKaya mga mahal kong kapatid at kababayan: Marami na tayong nagawa subali\u2019t higit pang marami ang kailangan nating gawin. May kasiyahang dulot ang mga tagumpay na ating natamo nitong nakaraang limang taon. Ngunit, ang hamon ng kaunlaran ay naghihintay pa rin sa atin lahat mga Pilipino. [\r\n] At ang darating na siglo ay magiging kakaiba kaysa panahon natin ngayon.\r\nWe can take satisfaction in what we have accomplished these past five years. But the challenge of development still lies ahead of us. And this coming century will be different from the one about to end. The future world will be shaped by at least two revolutionary changes. One is the adoption\u2014on a global scale\u2014of market-oriented strategies of industrialization. And the other is the phenomenal spread of information technology. Our reforms these past five years have moved our country into the mainstream of global commerce\u2014into the middle of the profound changes taking place in the world. The opportunities\u2014and the dangers\u2014inherent in this new situation are many; and one of these contingencies hit the economy three weeks ago. Together with other ASEAN currencies, the peso came under intense speculative attack, forcing its depreciation. The peso-dollar rate has, however, largely stabilized if we look at the market today as of noon time, the peso-dollar rate stabilized and the PHISIX index went up\u2014and why? Because our economic fundamentals are sound and strong. But there is no telling when another disturbance will occur. Let us be clear about what we should not do. We must reject all calls for a return to the closed, stagnant, and inward-looking economics of the last 40-45 years.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: The answer is not to retreat from the challenge of globalization. Let us not delude ourselves. Global integration is here to stay, whether we like it or not. The answer is to ensure our economy remains vigorous and sustainable\u2014and resilient enough to resist outside manipulations and strong enough to compete in the world. At the same time, we must reinforce the safety nets that we have put in place for our disadvantaged sectors, our poorest classes in the archipelago. We must work hard to win our place in the world\u2014because the world will not stop for those who stand idly by on the roadside of development.\r\nNow that we can afford to think beyond our people\u2019s immediate needs, we as national leaders must learn to look beyond the politician\u2019s perspective. We must learn to plan and prepare\u2014not just for the next election, but for the next generation. [\r\n] We must learn to look to what the world, the region, and the Philippines would be like\u2014not just over the next presidential term but over the next 10-15 years. These years that I mentioned will be crucial. Because they may turn out to be the last years of the post-Cold War era\u2014the last years of the superiority which America and her allies enjoy. Just now, no new superpower is likely to challenge the United States. But this period of stability underwritten by America\u2019s economic and military strength would not last forever. The future simply holds too many uncertainties. China\u2019s intentions in the South China Sea; how a new Russia will evolve from the ideological ruins of the Soviet Union; how peace can be organized once and for all on the Korean peninsula; and how Japan will respond to the challenge of helping ensure peace and stability in our region\u2014all these remain unclear. China\u2019s rapidly expanding economy will unavoidably press politically and militarily on East Asia. And in the not-too-distant future, China will once again become a great power\u2014and it is unrealistic for anyone to think that outsiders can prevent this from taking place. How China exercises its potential political, economic, and military clout must concern all countries of the Asia Pacific\u2014and none more so than we who are closest among its neighbors, especially the Philippines. With our partners in ASEAN, we agree that our best approach to China is to draw her into the network of economic and diplomatic collaboration\u2014for our mutual benefit.\r\nThe organization of an ASEAN-10 has been set back by recent events in Cambodia. But Southeast Asia\u2019s compulsion to unity is so strong that it cannot be stopped. ASEAN\u2019s Regional Forum (ARF) has drawn the great powers with interests in East Asia in a continuing dialogue to deal with regional security concerns, and among the most critical being\u2014that the south strategic sea-lanes of the China Sea should remain an international freeway, open to all innocent passage. Toward this goal, I officially proposed in 1994 the demilitarization of the South China Islets claimed by six littoral states, and the cooperative development of their resources. In the face of this uncertain security environment, the wisest course for us to follow in our foreign relations is\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: We must take every advantage of these next 10-15 years to complete modernizing our beloved Philippines\u2014to pull out by the roots the causes of internal dissidence\u2014to shore up our external defenses\u2014and to consolidate our unity with our neighbors in Southeast Asia. Only by so doing can we hope to assure the safety, the freedom and the prosperity of those who will come after us.\r\n\r\nThe 1997 survey of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), a United Nations agency, forecasts the region\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to grow within the range between 5.1% and 6.7% over the next 20 years. This is at least double the world\u2019s average GDP growth over the same period. We were at 5.5% by last we report. Our economy must at least match this growth rate. If our country is to become a significant player in the Asia-Pacific, then we must now prepare the place we want to have in this future world. We must find our competitive niche\u2014and nurture it.\r\nThey lie in our democratic and open society; our archipelagic setting; our strategic location astride the Great Oceans of Commerce of the world\u2014the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea; and in our talented managers and our adaptable workpeople. These are our advantages. We must build in this country the constellation of skills\u2014the education, research and development, the work ethic, and the entire infrastructure of knowledge\u2014that will enable us to develop technological leadership. To achieve these goals, I am submitting to this legislature, today, an updated technical report containing, among other things, our list of priority bills that we ask you, the distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress, to consider during this last session. The first thing we must do is to ensure that development spreads beyond the National Capital Region and our other metropolitan centers. We must awaken and energize all our regions\u2014all our islands\u2014all our provinces and cities and municipalities\u2014to the possibilities of modernization. And we must tap the talent pool that still lies dormant in our 69 million people, the majority of whom are under 40 years of age. We must break the remaining concentration of economic and political power in a few\u2014so that we can unleash the creativity, the resourcefulness, and the entrepreneurship in the many.\r\nWe have incorporated our peace initiative in the southern Philippines into a larger integrative process\u2014to make our Muslim and indigenous communities an autonomous part of a plural national society. The Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) and its consultative assembly are now working in conjunction with the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)\u2014helping build political consensus, coordinating development projects, and aiding in law enforcement. In this spirit of unifying the national community and the furtherance of the peace process, I urge the passage of a bill to amend the Organic Act of the ARMM (or Republic Act 6734) to enable our people in the Zone of Peace and Development [ZOPAD] in Southern Philippines to fast-track their development within the realm of an expanded regional autonomy. [\r\n] And in this connection, let me acknowledge the great contribution done by some of you in the House of Representatives led by the Speaker of the House himself, [\r\n] together with the chairman of our Government of the Republic of the Philippines panel, Ambassador Fortunato Abat, [\r\n] and the administrator of the National Irrigation Administration, Retired General Orlando Soriano, [\r\n] and the congressman who represents the particular district in which this breakthrough happen Deputy Speaker Simeon Datumanong, [\r\n] for now moving us one further but giant step into the final realization of peace and development in Mindanao. Likewise, ladies and gentlemen, this Congress must now pass the Cordillera Organic Act, which will enable\u2014\r\n[\r\n]\u2014the indigenous peoples of Northern Luzon to develop more speedily, while preserving their native culture and their environment. To make certain that development springs freely from the rice roots, we also must speed up the devolution of authority to provinces, cities and municipalities. We must remove the web of laws and regulations\u2014administered at the national level\u2014that restrains regions from developing each in its own way. And we must restore to local communities control over the political decisions that influence the way they live their lives. And, whatever we do, we must not allow growth to slow down\u2014because only sustained development will enable us to finally wipe out Filipino poverty. [\r\n] And we cannot allow our democracy to wither\u2014because Philippine democracy is our unique comparative advantage in the new global order. [\r\n] Only democracy can release the spirit of enterprise and creativity among our people, and without freedom, economic growth is meaningless. And so, freedom,\u00a0markets, and progress go together.\r\nOver these next 10-15 years, we must complete government\u2019s unfinished business\u2014the most urgent of which is to modernize Philippine agriculture. [\r\n] We will never achieve a generalized increase in living standards without transforming our farming communities. But we must complete other reforms\u2014like the liberalization of retail trade and the Anti-Trust/Anti-Monopoly Act\u2014because this will make the market system work more effectively. And we must continue to lay the infrastructure of facilities, services, and equipment that will allow national society to function more efficiently. Today, we are building infrastructure at a pace the country has not seen in 20 years. For example, we have tripled over the last five years the budget for roads and bridges alone. This pace must not slacken. For example, we have completed the road from this Batasan Complex coming from your backdoor going to the other side\u2014with a bridge over the Marikina River\u2014to San Mateo, Rizal, providing an alternate connection between here and there\u2014just in case. [\r\n] In social reform, we have addressed the concerns of the basic sectors and improved the quality of life in the 20 poorest provinces, and in the poorest municipalities, the fifth- and the sixth-class municipalities in all of our 78 provinces. an experimental program we call the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) has made a significant impact on the condition of 856 pilot barangays\u2014and so, as our national response mechanism, the CIDSS, we are applying this program to deal with people\u2019s minimum basic needs (MBN) in all of our poorest communities. The task remains unfinished; but I assure our basic sectors who are our poorest, that the executive commitment that we made in last year\u2019s anti-poverty summit will be substantively finished by the end of this year. [\r\n] And this we reviewed together in our eighth social reform council meeting only three days ago. Thus, I strongly urge this legislature to pass the bills in our social reform agenda [SRA] that remain in your hands, and have long been awaited by our basic sectors, namely\u2014the Fisheries Code, the Ancestral Domain Bill, the Land-Use Code, and the repeal of the Anti-Squatting Law otherwise known as PD 772. [\r\n] We have reduced the population growth rate marginally\u2014from 2.35% in 1990 to 2.32% in 1995. But this still means our population will double over the next 31 years, from today\u2019s near 70 million to 138 million. This press of sheer numbers will have a tremendous impact on poverty and on the degradation of our environment\u2014unless we do something and unless we start now. And that Population Management Bill is now here in the Tenth Congress. [\r\n] The plain truth is that we can no longer make do with economic leapfrogging because other countries are leapfrogging too. Our aim should be rather to pole-vault into the 21st century.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: Every cloud is said to have a silver lining and I agree. The recent speculative attack on the peso may have been a blessing in disguise because it gave us Filipinos the opportunity to enhance the competitiveness of the Philippine peso. We paid a small price for the long-term stability and resilience of our economy. Not only has allowing the peso\u2019s depreciation conserved our foreign exchange reserves. It should increase the real incomes of our exporters; tourism-related industries; our farmers and fisherfolks; our heroic overseas workers and their families, and other dollar earners. It should also reduce our trade deficit; and complete the transformation of our economy from an inward to an outward orientation. Most important of all, it enables us to continue creating more and better jobs for our workpeople. Depreciation, of course, has raised some fears of inflation. But we are confident that it will remain well within single-digit levels, with corresponding price stability because, I repeat, our macroeconomic fundamentals are solid and strong. [\r\n]\r\nFinancial sector reforms must focus on the need to keep our current account deficit at manageable levels. It is important that government now rationalize incentives to business to keep inefficient enterprises from proliferating. To promote efficiency and productivity in the financial sector, this Congress must now pass the remaining component measures of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program\u2014both to simplify taxation and to increase revenue generation. We must also nurture a stable capital market\u2014one that will encourage long-term investment confidence; mobilize efficiently domestic savings and foreign investments for our social and physical infrastructure; and work in conformity with international standards. Development of this capital market will require the passage of the Securities Regulation and Enforcement Act, and the Revised Investment Company Act\u2014both of which are already with this Congress. And as practiced during the past five SONAs, I shall today\u201430 days ahead of schedule\u2014also submit the President\u2019s budget for 1998\u2014all in the interest of sound financial management and the cost-effective utilization of public funds. [\r\n]\r\nIn industry, we must press on with the reforms that have already brought about profound changes in our industrial capabilities. We must nurture especially small and medium enterprises, our SMEs, which generate the most jobs at the smallest capital cost. Already SMEs make up 90% of our enterprises and employ 40% of our workers in manufacturing. We are starting with the private sector a common program for creating 1 million new Filipino entrepreneurs by the year 2000. [\r\n] The Magna Carta for Small Enterprises has increased the loanable funds set aside by the banking sector for SMEs from some P16 billion in 1992 to over P110 billion over the past five years. In agriculture, we have the natural resources and we have the manpower not only to feed our own people but to export to the world. What is lacking is a concerted and determined push to bring our agriculture into modernization. To spur the development of agriculture and industry, this Congress must now pass bills pending since 1995 such as the Agricultural Productivity and Irrigation Enhancement Act of 1995, [\r\n] which became the Propose Act of 1996; it is now 1997 which that provide more funds for irrigation, also agrarian reform and more electric power from renewable indigenous resources\u2014hydro, geothermal, riptide, wind, solar, and ocean, et cetera. This would also support the fisheries sector; mandate the efficient allocation of land for agriculture and industry, and encourage the development of appropriate technology. We must continue to promote labor-friendly legislation that leads to worker productivity, and support the initiatives and programs of the Cooperative Development Authority. [\r\n] We also propose the creation of a Water Resources Authority to integrate the 25 separate agencies now involved in various aspects of water management throughout the archipelago. This will enable us to unify policy and program development, and to cope with the nationwide droughts expected to happen because of the warm Pacific sea currents phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. And we must be mindful of the need to \u201c\r\n\u201d The Ramos administration has led in the global effort to implement the UN\u2019s so-called \u201cAgenda 21\u201d being the first country in our part of the world to put out its own National Council for Sustainable Development and putting out its implementing Philippine Agenda 21 (PA-21). This agenda of the United Nations on sustainable development requires specific executive actions to help nurture and preserve Mother Earth. We have taken cognizance of the fact that as we take an aggressive development agenda, we must match it with an updated, much stronger environmental management capability. That Congress has until now not passed any environmental act does not speak well of the Philippine state\u2019s commitment to the global ideal of sustainable development. [\r\n]\r\nDeregulation and privatization have worked particularly well in transportation and communications and energy. These policies have encouraged a rapid growth in demand, enabling the private sector to offer more and varied transport services\u2014like the Supercat ferries in the Visayas; the new airlines; and even big-ticket items like EDSA\u2019s MRT3; the Metro Manila Skyway; the expressways extending to Clark, Subic, and Batangas port; and Terminals II and III at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Business response to our deregulation of the communications industry has even been more enthusiastic. And this has allowed the government to concentrate on completing our alternate long-distance telecommunications backbone\u2014securing satellite slots for the private sector; and on dealing with high-tech crimes such as cellphone cloning and billing fraud\u2014for which we will be needing legislation. Over these next few months, beloved countrymen, ladies and gentlemen, we will have two Philippine satellites launched; and we shall be accelerating the development of our information infrastructure. From this Congress, we therefore seek passage of the Public Transportation Services Act, which should broaden and enhance our initiatives in deregulation. I also commend to this Congress the Shipping and Shipbuilding Incentives Bills; as well as the corporatization of the Air Transportation Office and the merger of the Land Transport Office and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board into one National Land Transportation Authority. We are also working on the privatization of the National Power Corporation and the Philippine Postal Corporation as key elements in our effort to pole-vault into the information age. We must continually move our energy development and supply well ahead of electric power demand. If we get these things done, the distances separating our 7,107 islands will compress dramatically\u2014as well as build virtual bridges over the waters, across the air, and into cyberspace.\r\nSince 1992, we have worked to integrate our science community\u2019s activities with agricultural and industrial production. Among other things, this made possible the operation of the so-called PH-net in 1994, which set off a boom in electronic networking. Science and technology scholarships granted by Congress have also widened our scientific and engineering manpower base. We have also established a network of institutes of molecular biology and biotechnology, to study biotech\u2019s applications in agriculture, industry, medicine, and the environment. And under our pole-vaulting strategy, we aim to turn the Philippines into an Asian hub for software development and training. We have several bills relating to science and technology pending in this Congress. The highest priority we assign to the proposed \u201cMagna Carta for Science and Technology Personnel,\u201d\u00a0which awards various incentives to our people engaged in science and technology. I commend to this Congress the proposal to establish a National Program for Gifted Filipino Children in Science and Technology; and the enactment of a law establishing a nationwide system of high schools specializing in the sciences and in engineering. And we must make more intensive investments in basic education, for basic education can unlock the intelligence hidden in every young mind. The same is true for our \u201cdual-training\u201d systems, \u201cremote\u201d educational institutions, and \u201copen\u201d universities. We must make our schools not only communities of learners where our children learn to read, write, and compute. We must make them schools of the future, which nurture young Filipinos to become responsible citizens and enlightened leaders of our country. We must now move aggressively to bring our people up to speed with the global economy. To create high-wage jobs in the future, human capital investments are the key. And in this spirit, I commend to this Congress\u2014as a Priority Administration Bill\u2014the Magna Carta for Students endorsed by our Social Reform Council. [\r\n]\r\nWe must improve government\u2019s capacity and efficiency across the board\u2014in its every aspect from top to bottom. The bureaucracy, the civil service we must further professionalize and local government units we must begin to use as strategic partners in development. The administration of justice we must make impartial, swift, thorough, unsparing. Law enforcement agencies we should reform, reorganize, and modernize to raise their level of competence and their standard of dedication to their duties. We will pursue our fight against heinous crimes with greater vigor even as we continue to cleanse government of the scalawags and grafters within its ranks, whether in the executive, the legislative, or judicial branch. [\r\n] And I ask all of you to join me in a crusade against dangerous drugs [\r\n], which threaten particularly our young people. And for this crusade, we need to amend the Dangerous Drugs Law and the passage of the Anti-Racketeering Bill. And we will employ the full force of government against the criminals, the outlaws, especially their masterminds, the drug lords, and the financiers [\r\n] who persist in challenging the rule of law and undermining the moral fabric of our society. We will hit them hard, again and again. [\r\n] Social protection we must assure particularly for women and children, who are the most vulnerable sectors of our population. In this work, thankfully, the justice system has recently brought to bar high-profile pedophiles and abusers of children. [\r\n] But we do need the enactment of the Anti-Rape Bill, which could have been done in your previous session. [\r\n]\r\nThe entire political system we must make more responsive to the challenges and the opportunities that the new century will bring. We must reexamine the Constitution as thoroughly as the Japanese, the South Koreans, the Thais, among others, are reexamining theirs to improve qualitatively the state\u2019s capacity to promote the interests of the national community, even as we recognize the people\u2019s right\u2014enshrined in the same Constitution\u2014to seek its improvement. [\r\n] And of the political reforms we must undertake, the most important include promoting a strong and responsible party system. We must encourage the radical Left as well as the conservative Right to take a healthy role in electoral politics as former military rebels and Muslim separatist have already done. And we must strengthen the institutions of direct democracy installed in the 1987 Constitution because accountability is the very essence of representative government. We must now pursue the electoral reforms still remaining, particularly in regard to computerization and absentee voting [\r\n]\u2014this are still undone and we shall need them for next year\u2019s crucial elections. Every successful election helps to consolidate democracy in our country.\r\nMga kagalang-galang na bumubuo sa Ika-Sampung Kongreso: ang ating \u201cpole-vaulting strategy\u201d ang pamana ng pangasiwaang Ramos sa mga darating pang panguluhan. Ang mga adhikain nito para sa pamahalaan at pribadong sektor ay hindi lamang taon kundi dekada ang bibilangin bago lubusang maging katuparan.\r\nThe pole-vaulting strategy I have articulated is the Ramos administration\u2019s legacy to future administrations. The tasks it sets for both government and civil society may take not just years but decades to realize in their fullness. Carrying out the pole-vaulting strategy is inherently the shared responsibility of all levels of government and of all sectors of society. Hence, we should continue to draw on the spirit of unity, solidarity, and teamwork that has energized our efforts these past five years. Those of us who will be graduating can continue to help and to guide. [\r\n] For my part, let me assure you\u2014for my part the work of government will never slacken during this final year of my watch. [\r\n] I will not be a\r\nPresident for two reasons [\r\n]: First, because that is not my nature, and you know that very well. [\r\n] And second,\r\n. [\r\n] I will be working and governing\u2014you will all feel and hear and see me working and governing as your President\u2014until I turn over the Presidency to the 13th President of the Republic at high noon on 30 June 1998. [\r\n]\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: now to sum up and conclude. On this my last state of the nation report, my message to this distinguished legislature is as urgent as it is simple: we cannot afford to think only in terms of the next election; our people will no longer allow an attitude of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in government. We must use these next 10-15 years\u2014during which we may expect regional stability to continue\u2014to prepare our people and our economy for the intensely competitive world of the 21st century. This \u201csurvival-of-the-fittest\u201d socioeconomic order and political order imposes severe penalties on the inefficient, the unskilled, the nonproductive, the timid, the disunited, and the\r\n. [\r\n] But great opportunities await the intelligent, the self-disciplined, the innovative, and the daring, the\r\nand the\r\n. This is what we must resolve to make our beloved Philippines these next 10-15 years. We must complete the reforms that will make our economy, our society a more efficient creator of wealth; our social structure a more equitable distributor of benefits; and our political system the guardian of our democracy. Finally:\r\nIto ang masasabi ko mga mahal na kapatid at mga kababayan: Ang pinakamahalagang bagay na ating nagawa ay hindi lamang ang pagbalik ng ating ekonomiya tungo sa pag-unlad. Higit pa rito, ang pinakamahalagang bagay na ating nagawa ay ang pagbalik sa bawat Pilipino ng ating paggalang sa sarili, paniniwala sa ating kakayahan, at pagtitiwala sa ating magandang kinabukasan. [\r\n]\r\nI would say this: The best thing we did has not merely been to restore the economy to the path of growth. I would say our greatest accomplishment has been to bring back the Filipino\u2019s sense of self-respect and pride; of faith in ourselves and of confidence in the future. And in all of these, let me as your President and in behalf of our people and government, acknowledge from the depths of my heart the invaluable cooperation, goodwill, and support of the Ninth and Tenth Congress [\r\n] as political institutions and, likewise, to the great majority of the individual members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, regardless of political affiliation. Together, we have labored hard and unceasingly to restore our nation to stability, growth, equity, and optimism, and for this, the present and future generations will be grateful. When that graduation day comes, we will have the honor to hand over to our successors, to the 13th President, in my case, and to the Eleventh Congress, in yours, a new kind of Philippines that our heroes of the centennial period envisioned\u2014a Philippines that will endure through the new century dawning upon us; a Philippines where our people, under God, can live together in freedom, dignity, and prosperity, at peace with themselves and with all mankind. To all of you of the Tenth Congress, and to all our people, I say:\r\nLet us go! Go!! Go, go, go!!!\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas!\r\nSalamat po sa inyong lahat!", "title": "The Challenges Still Ahead"},

Kagalang-galang na Pangulo ng Senado. Kagalang-galang na Speaker ng Mababang Kapulungan. Kagalang-galang na Punong Hukom ng Korte Suprema. Kagalang-galang na mga miyembro ng Kongreso ng Pilipinas. Kagalang-galang na mga kagawad ng mga Gabinete. Their excellencies of the diplomatic corps. Mga piling panauhin. Mga minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nNoong Mayo onse, mahigit na 10 milyong Pilipino ang nagdesisyon na pamunuan natin ang bansa, patungo sa bagong milenyo.\r\nNgayon, sila ang nagtatanong, ano ba ang gagawin ng bagong pamunuang ito upang ihatid ang ating bansa sa bagong siglo?\r\nToday, I stand before you with an accounting of the present and with a road map for our future.\r\nPaano ba tayo itatawid sa krisis na nakabalot sa ating ekonomiya?\r\nNasaan na ba tayo ngayon?\r\nSaan ba tayo nanggaling?\r\nAt saan ba tayo patutungo?\r\nHindi na ako magpapaliguy-ligoy. Nasa harap tayo ngayon ng matinding krisis na gumugulo sa buong Asya.\r\nAyon sa mga eksperto, wala pa tayo sa pinakamalubhang yugto ng krisis.\r\nKung babalewalain natin ang kinalalagyan natin ngayon, tiyak na lulubog ang ating bansa sa bigat ng ganap ng recession.\r\nMalubha ang lagay ng ating ekonomiya, at namimiligro ang kabang-yaman ng bansa.\r\nNgunit hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang pamahalaan. At lalong hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang sambayanang Pilipino.\r\nSawa na ang taumbayan sa mga walang-kabuluhang pangako\u2019t palabas. Sa harap ng matinding krisis na ating pinagdaanan nitong nakaraang taon, ang kailangan nati\u2019y mga mabilis at mabisang lunas. Ito ang matinding hamon na dapat nating tugunan\u2014tayong lahat: ang panguluhan, ang Kongreso, ang pribadong sektor, ang mamamayan. Mabigat ang hamon na ito\u2014subali\u2019t buo ang tiwala kong mas matimbang ang pinagsama nating talino, sipag, at kakayahan.\r\nBut let us first make an accounting of the present. A true accounting that is perhaps long overdue.\r\nNitong unang bahagi ng 1998, ang paglago ng gross domestic product [GDP] ay katumbas lamang sa 20 percent ng antas na naitala noong 1997.\r\nNangalahati ang produksyon ng mga pabrika natin. Pawang pagbabawas ng imbentaryo\u2014at hindi ang paglikha ng mga produkto\u2014ang ginawa ng mga industriya natin. Sa kanilang pangangamba sa recession, lalo lamang pinalala ang problema.\r\nBumagsak ang ating produksyong pang-agrikultura. Bumaba nang 14 percent ang ani ng palay, at bumaba din nang 24 percent ang ani ng mais.\r\nMalimit nating tukuyin ang phenomenon ng El Ni\u00f1o, subalit ang tunay na ugat ng suliranin ay ang pangkalahatang sektor ng agrikultura.\r\nHalos double-digit na ang ating inflation rate. Napakataas ang interes na sinisingil ng mga bangko kaya naman hindi makautang ang marami nating negosyante. At lalo namang hinigpitan ng mga bangko ang kanilang pagpapautang, kaya\u2019t maraming kalakal ang nagsasara.\r\nDahil sa debalwasyon at sa El Ni\u00f1o, tuluy-tuloy ang pagbagsak ng ating piso. Ito ay lubhang mabigat para sa ating mga kababayan natin na isang kahig, isang tuka ang kinagisnang pamumuhay.\r\nUnemployment is now 13.3 percent and still growing; underemployment, 20 percent and also growing. 4.3 million Filipinos need a job. Twice that number wish they had a real, full-time job.\r\nMaaaring sabihing ito ay maliit pa. Subali\u2019t paano mo sasabihin sa pamilyang gutom na mas masama ang kalagayan ng ibang pamilya sa ibang bansa?\r\nOne lost job is one hungry family, and one cold statistic I cannot agree.\r\nStatistics claim that the number of poor people has gone down in the past decade. I wonder if the people believe these statistics.\r\nWala sa akin ang mga statistics na iyan. Poor is poor\u2014walang pera, walang pagkain, walang bubong, walang dignidad, at lalung-lalo na, walang pag-asa.\r\nHindi lang iyan. \u2018Yung mayaman ay higit pang yumaman, at ang mahihirap lalong humirap.\r\nI wish that I could say that we shall set up a job security fund soon. But I don\u2019t want to add to the inventory of unfunded laws and bills that now amount to P400 billion worth of promises that will never be fulfilled.\r\nAccording to statistics, in the past six years, as the Philippine economy grew, the richest 10 percent got 40 percent of the national income.\r\nAnd the poorest 10 percent? Wala pang dalawang porsiyento.\r\nIt is worse in the countryside, where 40 percent of Filipinos still work for one-third of wages in the city. That is why they come here. Only to find that there are no jobs, or none for which they qualify.\r\nNoong araw, inakala ko na marami na kusang darating sa ating bansa ang mga banyagang negosyante dahil ang mga manggagawa natin ay mahuhusay at handang tumanggap ng mababang sahod. Hindi na ito totoo.\r\nNapakababa ng productivity ng karaniwang manggagawang Pilipino dahil kalahati na lang sa kanila ang nakapagtapos sa mababang paaralan samantalang tatlumpu\u2019t tatlong porsiyento lang ang nakaabot ng high school.\r\nNgunit limitado ang pondo na maari nating ilaan para sa edukasyon; may kakulangan tayong 24,000 silid-aralan, at 4,000 guro.\r\nHindi lamang sa larangan ng edukasyon\u2014hanggang ngayon, mahigit sa tatlumpung porsiyento ng tahanan sa bansa ay wala pa ring kuryente. At sa boung Asya, sunod lamang sa bansang Hapon ang taas ng singil natin sa kuryente.\r\nSa larangan ng agrarian reform, na ngayon ay nasa ika-26 na taon na.\r\nOnly 57 percent of target areas have been distributed, while productivity has become lower.\r\nThis does not mean that the land should have been left with the landlords, but that the farmers should not have been left to fend for themselves.\r\nThis is where we are now. Add anarchy on the peace and order front, where the only thing organized is crime, and the only thing systematic is kidnapping. The result: capital flight. Yet some officials think they can attract foreign funds with tax incentives for potential kidnap victims.\r\nAng sinumang bagong Pangulo ay may pangarap at minimithing para sa bansa lalung-lalo na sa akin, na malaki ang inaasahan ng masang Pilipino. Ngunit gustuhin ko man na maibigay ang kanilang inaasahan sa lalong madaling panahon, paano ko ibibigay kung wala tayong sapat na pananalapi na igugugol para maiangat ang kanilang kabuhayan?\r\nWe have a P70 billion budget deficit and a consolidated public sector deficit that could go as high as P90 billion. Collection of taxes and duties are down, even as more and more tax exemptions and incentives cut deep into government revenues.\r\nGovernment could borrow more. But that will only raise interest rates and worsen the economic slowdown. The result: less taxes and fewer jobs.\r\nIf high interest rates squeeze GNP by just two percent more, there will be half a million more jobless. But if we pressure the Bangko Sentral to print more money, inflation will shoot up.\r\nKaliwa\u2019t kanan, may latay, napakahirap tumimbang, at sadyang malala ang problema natin. Gayunpaman, nasa ugat ng problema ang nakikita kong solusyon.\r\nThe problems we face are of such magnitude as to require nothing less than heroic and concerted action. We must move upon them as a single community, bound together by common rules that we all agree to respect and obey.\r\nTo begin with, we have to reduce the cost of governance, costs that go higher and higher with each corrupt act, with each wasteful project.\r\nBilyun-bilyong piso ang nawawaldas sa mga proyektong maaksaya at kulang sa silbi, at lalong malaki pa ang nawawalang parang bula dahil sa patuloy na mga kurakot.\r\nBusiness pays taxes, but mostly into the pockets of BIR agents or customs examiners instead of the national treasury.\r\nIn 1998 alone, we can save as much as P34 billion from pork barrel.\r\nP4.6 billion went to the centennial celebration, but the Department of Social Welfare had to beg for P100 million in emergency food aid to drought victims in Mindanao, and did not get it.\r\nThe 1997 World Development Report ranks the Philippine Civil Service as among the most politicized in the world, with politics deciding appointments down to janitor. The 1992 Corruption Index ranked the Philippines as the second most corrupt country in the region.\r\nDebt service took 27 percent of the national budget last year; P26.4 billion in the first semester of 1998 alone. The total external debt, including the private sector, is $45.4 billion or P1.9 trillion pesos.\r\nNang ako\u2019y maupo bilang Pangulo, nagulat ako nang ipaalam sa akin na umabot na pala sa P2.3 trillion ang kabuuang utang ng pampublikong sektor.\r\nHindi na bilyun-bilyon ang usapan ngayon, kundi trilyun-trilyon na.\r\nWe know where we are: in an economic slowdown, deep in the Asian crisis.\r\nWe know that we don\u2019t have much to work with.\r\nPrevious leaders have laid down both political and economic reforms that make up an enduring framework from which we can further build.\r\nBut we race against time, as an impatient public ask us: When will those reforms pay dividends for the common man?\r\nWell, we just have to begin now. With honesty, with thrift, with efficiency.\r\nTama na ang pagpapasasa.\r\nTama na ang nakawan.\r\nTama na ang aksaya.\r\nTama na ang mga palabas.\r\nKailangan magbanat tayo ng mgabuto, at tunay na serbisyo ang siyang dapat na maging balangkas para sa ating mga solusyon. [\r\n]\r\nNgayon taon, mula sa inaasahang P93 bilyon, pababa sa P60 bilyon lamang, kailangang magsagawa ng mga kaukulang pagbabago at pagtitipid ang pamahalaan upang lalo pang paliitin ang inaasahang kakulangan nito sa P40 bilyon lamang.\r\nIn order to achieve these targets, we will resolutely pursue several major cutbacks in expenditure programs.\r\nFirst, I have instructed the secretary of the budget to continue to withhold 25 percent of budget allocations, excluding salaries and wages, from the various national agencies, including the Office of the President.\r\nSecond, we will continue to withhold 10 percent from the internal revenue allotment of the local government units [LGUs].\r\nThird, I believe that congress shares my conviction that we have to abolish the pork barrel in the face of our fiscal position. [\r\n] Kakaunti ang mga congressman na pumapalakpak. [\r\n] Our people ask no less.\r\nLastly, I will postpone the implementation this year of various programs earmarked for funding from the military camp sale proceeds, including the AFP modernization program. [\r\n]\r\nWe will also move quickly to dispose of the burden of government-owned corporations. I urge Congress to prioritize the bill privatizing the NAPOCOR within the first three months of the 11th session. Privatization of government shares in Pasar, Philphos, Petron, FTI, PNB, PNOC-EDC, PNCC, Meralco, and the two government-owned television stations will commence this year. The Department of Finance will put in place, within 100 days, a program to spin off or restructure the rest of the government corporations. Ngunit ang mga ospital ng pamahalaan ay kailanman ay hindi natin ibebenta. [\r\n] At mananatiling susuportahan ng ating pamahalaan.\r\nAll dealings, contracts, and negotiations will be done with complete transparency and integrity, every step of the way. [\r\n]\r\nAny indication of anomaly, I will immediately cancel the sale.\r\nUulitin ko, isang balita lang tungkol sa katiwalian, ipatitigil ko ang anumang klase ng subasta. Kahit sino pa sila. [\r\n]\r\nI have ordered an inventory of all government lands titled to departments and bureaus and their transfer to the national government. I want my officials to keep out of the real estate business and stick to public service. [\r\n]\r\nBut let us not forget that privatization is mainly an emergency response to an emergency situation.\r\nIt is therefore my intention to initiate institutional reform of the entire budget process. My administration has just completed its first three-year budget framework, which the national government will soon propose to Congress as our budget accord. In contrast to the current practice where only the executive decides on the initial list of programs and projects, the budget accord will involve both Congress and the executive in the selection of projects to be approved by the President. And the total of these expenditures cannot exceed predetermined, irrevocable ceilings over the three-year period. [\r\n]\r\nSa panig po naman ng pananalapi, umaasa akong magtatagumpay ang action plan ng Department of Finance upang maging epektibo ang pangongolekta ng buwis.\r\nThe action plan of the Department of Finance will start with an asset census, intended to establish an up-to-date and reliable database on the net worth of all tax-paying Filipinos.\r\nWe will push for a tax amnesty that will give peace of mind to delinquent taxpayers and tax credits to honest ones. Pagkatapos ng tax amnesty, I will assure you that we will apply the full force of the law against tax evaders. [\r\n]\r\nTinitiyak ko sa inyo na hindi lamang natin hahabulin ang mga tax evaders na ito kundi siguradong mapaparusahan, sino man sila. [\r\n]\r\nWe will establish a large taxpayers unit at the BIR. We will suspend the implementation of certain BOI exemptions granted to companies under laws and executive orders that expired in 1997. [\r\n]\r\nThe fiscal reforms forced upon us by the economic crisis will continue to serve us well even after the crisis is over. I will take this opportunity to establish fiscal discipline in the spending habits of government. Although we have to tolerate a certain amount of deficit this year, we will try as best as possible to pursue a balanced budget for the national government in the coming years. The consolidated deficit for the entire public sector will be limited to no more than 1 percent of the country\u2019s GNP.\r\nMakikinabang ang lahat sa mga gagawin nating ito: Hindi lamang ang pamahalaan, kundi ang karaniwang mamamayan na rin.\r\nSa larangan ng ating financial system, patuloy na igagalang ng aking administrasyon ang kalayaan ng ating Monetary Board at ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\r\nSubali\u2019t hindi kailangang magdusa ng lubos ang kalakalan sa patuloy na pagtaas ng interest rates.\r\nKakatigan ko ang pagbaba ng interest at ang pagpapabilis sa daloy ng pananalapi, lalo na sa mga maliliit na negosyo. Gayunpaman, titiyakin kong ang salapi ng mga government financial institution [GFI] ay hindi sosolohin ng mga iilang korporasyon.\r\nGiant corporations and powerful groups have cornered a huge chunk of the resources of government banks, whose mandate is principally to help agriculture and small and medium enterprises.\r\nThis practice will be reversed. Sobra na ang kanilang pagsasamantala. These billionaires have pushed small borrowers to lending windows that charge much higher interest rates. From this time on, GFIs will truly, sincerely, service the common people\u2019s needs. [\r\n]\r\nIpinamalas din ng kasalukuyang krisis ang peligro ng labis na pag-asa sa mga pondong nagmumula sa labas, kaya\u2019t kailangan nating pag-ibayuhin ang sarili nating pag-iipon, nang may sarili tayong pampuhunan sa ating mga proyekto.\r\nSa dako naman tayo ng agrikultura, na lubhang napabayaan, kaya\u2019t ang food security ng 70 milyong Pilipino ay nasa bingit ng alanganin.\r\nThe monopoly of rice importation by the National Food Authority has not stabilized prices, nor has it broken the cartels. Two administrations have declared sugar a sunset industry, doomed to die. Maybe. All I know is that, sunset industry or not, I cannot leave three million families who depend on sugar in the dark, with nothing to eat after the sun goes down.\r\nMarahil ang paglubog ng ating agrikultura ay dulot ng kulang na imprastruktura. Hindi sapat ang bilang ng mga daanan na nag-uugnay sa mga bukid at mga pamilihan.\r\nBakit nga ba magtatanim kung hindi mo naman maibebenta ang iyong inani?\r\nWe are condoning irrigation fees. Ibibigay natin ng libre ang patubig sa ating magsasaka. [\r\n]\u00a0At the same time, we will launch a full-scale program based on cost-effective irrigation technologies.\r\nKailangan nating gumawa ng 140,000 kilometro ng mga bagong daan. Magkakahalaga ito ng P484 billion.\r\nWithout graft and corruption, this will be money well spent. It could also jumpstart the economy.\r\nTungkol naman sa ating kapaligiran, ipapairal natin ang ganap na pagbabawal sa pagtotroso o total log ban. [\r\n] Maglulunsad tayo ng bagong programa sa muling pagtatanim ng mga puno.\u00a0But not like in the past when massive reforestation was another excuse for massive corruption.\r\nTraffic tells us that we need more roads and we need to finish them faster. One reason for delay of roads and other projects is the issuance of temporary restraining orders or TROs. I will not interfere with the judiciary, but I urge the Supreme Court to remind judges of the lawyer\u2019s oath to delay no man for money.\r\nMasyado ng garapal ang bentahan ng temporary restraining order. [\r\n]\r\nWalang lakas ang mahihirap upang tulungan ang kanilang sarili, ngunit ngayon, kahit ang gobyerno ay kapos sa pondo. So we must strategize to maximize.\r\nDole-outs are out, but basic social services are only just and right. That means basic health care, basic nutrition, and useful education for those who want it but cannot afford it.\r\nWe will speed up the program to establish one science high school in every province. [\r\n] We will give education subsidies straight to deserving students and teachers without passing through the schools. That way they can choose where to study and where to teach.\r\nAng lahat ng mga ito ay nangangailangan ng salapi. Sa mga susunod na hakbangin, kailangan lamang natin ang tapang at political will. Nilagdaan ko na ang executive order na lumilikha sa tinaguriang Presidential Task Force against Organized Crime. Bunga nito, katakut-takot na batikos ang ipinukol sa akin.\r\nIsang tanong, isang sagot: Kontra ba tayo sa krimen, o sa mga lulmalaban sa krimen? The task force is what I think is needed to hit crime, and hit it hard so as to put it out\u2014decisively. [\r\n] Maybe there is a better way, but no one has shown me this. They only say that I am wrong but not how I can do it right and effectively.\r\nSawa na ako sa kanila. Pati na ang mamamayan, sawa na rin. Sawa na sa puro pamumulitika. Sawa na sa puro salita, ngunit wala namang nagagawa kundi laitin ang mga lumalaban sa krimen. Buo na ang aking pasiya. Tuloy ang presidential task force against the criminals.\r\nI propose that Congress amends the Dangerous Drug Act to eliminate the possibility of probation for all offenders. Even if they say they are sorry. The only place for a drug dealer and the addict is together in jail.\r\nI shall propose another controversial measure. I want to devolve greater administrative control over the Philippine National Police to the local government units. [\r\n] I am sure I will get hit for this also. Perhaps there is a constitutional question here. But one thing is sure, I am not abusing power. What I am doing is sharing some of my power with the local executives over the national police.\r\nAng pulis na baon sa hirap ay hindi nalalayo sa tukso na mang-abuso. Pero hindi ako nagdududa na gagampanan nang tapat ng mga alagad ng batas ang kanilang tungkulin kahit na gaano pa silang kahirap.\r\nNgunit bakit pa natin pabibigatin ang kanilang kalagayan? Naniniwala ako na kapag sapat ang sahod ng ating mga alagad ng batas, higit na magiging propesyonal ang ating mga pulisya.\r\nSa krimen, ang sagot natin ay kaparusahan. Sa rebelyon, ang tugon natin ay negosasyon.\r\nSa mga nagsisialsa, ay tapat lamang ang pagnanasa na makamit ang pagbabago sa lipunan, tayo ay handang makipag-negosasyon.\r\nSubali\u2019t sa mga terorista, wala tayong panahon.\r\nSa mga kapatid nating Muslim, hinihiling ko ang pagkakataon na mabigyan ng katarungan ang napakaraming taon ng kapabayaan. Tigilan natin ang dahas, at pag-ibayuhin ang sandugong kapatiran. Samantalang ang karapatan ng ating mga kababaihan ay patuloy nating itataguyod.\r\nAs President, I inherit not only the problems but the responsibility to finish what my predecessors have started. That includes the resolution of ill-gotten wealth cases from the Marcos era. [\r\n] I will do so. We have talked of settlements but we have not precluded continuing prosecution.\r\nYet these cases have gone on long enough. Therefore, I order the Presidential Commission on Good Government to go forward on all ill-gotten wealth cases with all the evidence it has taken 12 long years to collect.\r\nNo more delays.\r\nOne way or another, I want these cases to end in one year, in final judgments or acceptable settlements.\r\nPagkatapos ng 12 taon, siguro naman may katibayan na upang mabigyan ng katarungan ang sambayanang Pilipino. Ito ang maliwanag na halimbawa ng justice delayed, justice denied.\r\nSa dakong external security naman. Effective national defense requires not just modern weaponry but better fighting men. Before we spend on expensive hardware, let us have the right kind of soldiers. It is not weapons that win wars but the men who fight them.\r\nUntil we develop a credible military deterrent, we must depend on the goodwill of our neighbors, on our treaty commitments with the United States, and on the skills of our diplomats in conveying to everyone that we want only peace, stability, and a shared prosperity.\r\nIt is said that my stand as a senator against the U.S. Bases Treaty disqualifies me as President from endorsing the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States.\r\nOn the contrary, because I stood up for the Philippine sovereignty in 1991, now as your President, I have the moral right to stand up for Philippine security today. [\r\n]\r\nSa bahagi naman ng pamamahala, itinatag ang pamahalaan upang paglingkuran ang mga mamamayan\u2014at hindi ang kanyang sarili. Kung tutuusin kailangan natin ng higit pang pamamahala\u2014lalo na upang itaguyod ang kapakanan ng mga maralita.\r\nSa ngayon, labis-labis ang ating pamamahala, subalit kulang na kulang naman ang mga serbisyong pampubliko.\r\nPakikiusapan ko ang Kongreso na bigyan ako ng kapangyarihan para reorganisahin ang gobyerno upang ito ay maging matipid at masinop. The aim is not to change officials but to rationalize government operations. We are a small country, we should only have a small government. Not only on the national but also on the local level.\r\nTungkol naman sa ating electoral reforms, hindi lamang halalang mapayapa ang ating kailangan, kundi kampanyang hindi lubhang magastos. Hindi lamang karapatan ng mga mamamayang bumoto ang dapat natin tiyakin; dapat siguruhin natin na ang mga boto nila ay mabibilang.\r\nUpang makamit ito, kailangan bigyan ang Komisyon sa Halalan ng higit pang kapangyarihan upang harangin at parusahan ang lahat ng uri ng pandaraya. Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na magpatibay ng batas upang gawing heinous crime ang anumang electoral fraud. [\r\n] Kailangan matapos ang computerization program bago sumapit ang susunod na eleksiyon. Natitiyak kong marami pa tayong magagawa sa ikabubuti ng pangangasiwa ng pamahalaan\u2014ngunit maaring kailangan pang baguhin ang ilang mga alituntunin ng saligang batas. Darating ang panahon ng pagbabago sa ating Saligang Batas.\r\nMga kagalang-galang ng kinatawan ng sambayanang Pilipino: Hayaan ninyong wakasan ko ang mensaheng ito sa pagsambit ng isang taimtim na pag-asa.\r\nNgayong taon\u2014sa kabila ng mga mabibigat na suliranin\u2014sumusulong pa rin ang ating ekonomiya.\r\nThis year, despite formidable odds, we still expect some economic growth. Our gross national product is targeted to expand this year by 2 to 3 percent. While other countries in the region have registered negative GNP, we continue to have positive growth\u2014this, I would say, is a credit to my predecessor, Former President Ramos. [\r\n] We believe we can keep inflation based on 1998 prices in the single digits, at around 9.5 percent.\r\nTo conclude, my aim is to help our country escape the recession. My solutions are obvious, my proposals may be commonplace, but they were never adapted before.\r\nIn sum, they are to spend wisely and less. And by austerity and hard work generate the means to cover the shortfalls of the past, so we can have a smooth runway for a final takeoff.\r\nPerhaps by then, six years will have passed, and someone else will take over as pilot. I am honored enough to be elected to the position of the highest responsibility, power, and trust in the land.\r\nI have neither pretensions nor further ambition, only the sincere desire to serve, to help the least of our people. [\r\n] Kaya po ako\u2019y humihingi sa inyo ng kaunting pag-unawa, kaunting panahon, kaunting pagtitiis alang-alang sa ating bayan, at higit sa lahat para sa ating nakakaraming mahihirap na mamamayan.\r\nNaniniwala ako na kapag nagawa natin na tayo\u2019y nagkaisa, tayo\u2019y nagkasama-sama, lahat ng klaseng pagsubok ay malalampasan natin. Nandiyan din ang ating hamon; nandiyan din ang ating tagumpay.\r\nMaraming, maraming salamat po. [\r\n] [\r\n]", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1995-07-24 01:17:18+00:00", "author": "Fidel V. Ramos", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 24, 1995]\r\nMr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; distinguished members of Congress:\r\nAng pag-unlad sa alinmang bagay\u2014upang makamtan\u2014dapat ay may sapat na puhunan. Ang ilan dito ay ang taos-pusong pagsisikap, tiyaga, at pakikipagtulungan. Noong lumipas na panahon, hindi natumbasan ang kinakailangang puhunan upang mapaunlad ang buong Pilipinas.\r\nDevelopment\u2014we are often told\u2014has a price that must be paid by those who want it. In the past, because we had been unwilling to pay that price, our nation could only falter and decline. Today we are a more capable people\u2014and a more capable country because these past three years. We have paid a substantial down payment on development. The reforms we have dared to carry out; the hardships we have endured; the gains we have won\u2014all these will reap benefits of progress.\r\nAgain and again, over these three years, we have shown ourselves\u2014and the world\u2014that the Filipino can succeed in the struggle for development, carry ambitious programs to their conclusion, and succeed, not by taking the authoritarian road but by democratic consensus and collective effort. The story of our turnaround I have detailed in an accompanying technical report, which I submit for the Congressional record. I also submit today the proposed 1996 General Appropriations Act with my budget message. The budget we see as our country\u2019s bridge to the 21st century. In preparing it, we were guided by two things: First, that the only way to deal with limited resources is to have infinite resourcefulness. Second, our concern is not just to count every peso but to make every peso count.\r\nOur economy is growing. This time, growth is driven by investment and exports, not by consumer spending. Inflation we have kept at single-digit levels and interest rates are decreasing. And for a change, we see the peso rise instead of decline. Political stability underpins our turnaround. We held two successful elections these past three years\u2014proving Philippine democracy is no longer fragile as it once was. And we have gone some way in placing the common tao at the center of our development efforts\u2014both as agent and as beneficiary. We have made diplomacy a tool for development. We are riding the wave of globalization\u2014and winning for ourselves a place of respect in the family of nations.\r\nYet, these are only foundations to build on. Our work is far from over. The suspension of civil conflicts is not peace. The containment of crime is not order. Two years of growth do not add up to modernization. And the free-market economy does not necessarily work like the rising tide which equally lifts all boats.\r\nOver these next three years, we have six major tasks:\r\nThe continued expansion and modernization of the economy must be our primordial concern. This early we must ask ourselves: Can we catch up\u2014and then keep in step\u2014with our vigorous neighbors? If we fail to adapt to new economic realities, we will lag even farther behind. Worse, we may fritter away the gains we have already won. How then do we squarely face this challenge? How do we stay on track and accelerate our advance? God helps those who help themselves. Our economic turnaround is an achievement created\u2014with God\u2019s help\u2014by our people\u2019s labor and will. All that government can justly claim is that it has begun to create the environment in which business can flourish, and workers can create wealth, and secure for themselves a just share of it. We must press on with deregulation and liberalization and bring down the last of our self-imposed barriers to economic growth left over from the age of protectionism.\r\nThe other day, I issued Executive Order no. 264 promulgating a tariff reduction program that accelerates our economy\u2019s outward orientation. Now I propose this Congress repeal the remaining laws\u2014some enacted almost half a century ago\u2014that still limit economic growth and deny consumers access to quality goods at lower prices. For example, in retail trade, the restriction designed (in 1954) to protect Filipino businessmen from non-Filipino competitors had long been overtaken by events. The once-alien competitors have all become fellow Filipinos. Yet, the old law ironically protects them from potential competition from the outside\u2014to the prejudice of our consumers. Five other laws that should have been repealed or amended long ago include the Investment Company Act of 1960, which contains a provision requiring all directors of investment companies to be citizens (although, strangely enough, the same law does not restrict foreign equity in these companies). For 35 years, this restrictive provision of law has prevented foreign investors from establishing mutual funds in our country. With the lifting of foreign exchange controls, the Uniform Currency Act of 1950 should now be repealed to allow a free market in international financial and trading transactions. I also ask Congress to repeal the minimum capital requirements for foreign investors in wholesale and export enterprises under negative list \u201cb\u201d, and to delete entirely negative list \u201cc\u201d of the Foreign Investments Act of 1991. I further ask Congress to amend the Financing Company Act of 1969 and the Investment Houses Act of 1973 to allow unrestricted foreign investment in finance companies and investment houses. Moreover, we must take the necessary steps now to ensure the rapid development and expansion of our domestic capital market.\r\nWith this further economic liberalization, Metro Manila can now compete to become a financial and trading center in Southeast Asia and our archipelago can aspire to become a landmark in the borderless world of the future. Let us not delude ourselves: It is a brutally competitive economic order emerging out there. Many lean and hungry peoples are being integrated into the global economy. Competition is particularly fierce for trade and investments. And the countries most likely to capture these investments are those that set out the appropriate policies. We are fully committed to meet our commitments under the World Trade Organization [WTO], including the upholding of intellectual property rights in accordance with international conventions.\r\nUltimately, the pace of growth will depend on how solidly we build our platform for takeoff. That platform will be stable only if it is built on the rock of peace, civil order, and social harmony. This is why we have offered peace with honor to the military rebels, radical insurgents, and southern secessionists. We knew from the start the road to peace would be long and hard. But the alternative of bloody conflict and terrorism is worse. The initial successes of our peace initiatives are evident\u2014the chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] campaigning peaceably in our southern provinces for a Muslim autonomous region\u2014and the commander of the military rebels now belonging to this August body as an elected senator of the Republic.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress: If the peace process is to be a test of government\u2019s patience and forbearance, then I assure you we have patience and forbearance enough\u2014and above all, the will to forge a just settlement that will endure. And if it is to be a test of our courage and steadfastness, why then, we have that courage and steadfastness, also!\r\nIn our pilgrimage for peace, you can count on government to walk the extra mile. But with the misguided few among our countrymen who have associated themselves with international terrorism, we will be much less patient and definitely more firm. Political fanatics no one can reach through reason and compromise. This is why I ask this Congress to pass an Anti-Terrorism Act, which defines terrorism as a heinous crime and penalizes it with life imprisonment or death. On still another front\u2014in our war on criminality\u2014we will be just as unrelenting. Crimes against women and children are particularly abominable. I ask this Congress to pass without delay bills which impose harsh penalties for rape and for child prostitution, pedophilia, and child pornography. You and I know criminality coexists with and is emboldened by corruption in the bureaucracy, especially in the police. This is why we have undertaken\u2014once again\u2014a comprehensive reform and reorganization of the national police. As we continue to rid the Philippine National Police [PNP] of misfits, we must strengthen the hand and improve the lot of those who bear the burden of protecting us in our homes, in the streets, and in our workplaces. I ask this Congress for the early passage of the PNP Modernization Bill and the amendments to Republic Act no. 6975. This will enable the PNP to further professionalize, upgrade salary and other benefits, acquire adequate communications and transport systems, and set up state-of-the-art crime laboratories. These measures must be complemented by your passage of the Crime-Control Act of 1995, which will harmonize the operations of our law enforcement agencies, particularly our campaign against loose firearms, private armed groups, and criminal syndicates.\r\nWe also need to raise the efficiency\u2014and safeguard the integrity\u2014of our judicial system. The executive and the judiciary have found the courage to cooperate\u2014to reform the criminal justice system\u2014through a recently established National Council on the Administration of Justice [NCAJ]. Congress has already done a great deal to help along this process by setting up a fund estimated at P2.0 billion for reforms in the judicial and prosecution service.\r\nEven as we seek peace and justice for all, we must reassure our people that our political system works, and give them a stronger voice in the affairs of our nation. But this, our people cannot have\u2014unless we change the mainspring of political power in this country from money, influence, and patronage to talent and merit. The most urgent measures are to\r\nOur difficulty in achieving political reform arises not only from the lack of enabling laws but also from the weight of our traditional culture of \u201cpalakasan\u201d and \u201cpalusutan.\u201d Most of the rich and powerful still demand\u2014and often receive\u2014preferential treatment in the transactions of daily life\u2014beginning with exemption from traffic rules to tariff walls for their monopolies. This focus on special privilege and special treatment we must remove from our culture. We cannot enter the 21st century with one foot stuck in the feudal era. As we speak of a \u201cculture of excellence,\u201d so must we cultivate a \u201cculture of responsibility and accountability.\u201d\r\nThose who deride our economic performance and social programs as not having improved the lives of the poorest Filipinos use one of the oldest logic tricks in the book\u2014building a straw man only to knock it down. Growth in a free-market economy favors the better-endowed regions, and the better-equipped segments of the economy\u2014but only initially. As is well known, the long march to prosperity is measured in years and even decades. It is a journey we Filipinos have barely begun, although we can take comfort in the thought that each step taken brings us closer to our goal. But because the poor cannot wait\u2014because, in Gabriela mistral\u2019s phrase, the child\u2019s name is today\u2014we have intervened to put poverty alleviation at the center of government\u2019s concerns. We reject the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d approach. Our social reform agenda focuses directly upon the 19 poorest provinces and on specific sectors who are the poorest of the poor.\r\nWe are a long way from wiping out poverty. Right now, our more realistic goal is to prevent poverty from perpetuating itself. Our war against poverty must be fought by a strong army of citizens. We must mobilize not only government but the entire citizenry on the rallying cry of self-help and self-reliance. All hands\u2014not just government\u2019s\u2014are needed to win this war. The impetus for any winning strategy should come from below\u2014by harnessing the energies of the poor themselves. Thus, our approach to eradicate poverty is founded on three major interventions:\r\nAs we pursue our economic development efforts, we will also improve the delivery and coverage of basic services to provide the minimum basic needs of our people\u2014water services, electricity, housing, jobs, and livelihood opportunities, credit support, among others. We will further accelerate easy credit support for small- and medium-scale enterprises [SMEs] even as our financial institutions have provided some P47 billion worth of credit to them over the past two years or about three times more than the previous 10-year period. Our legislative agenda also includes urgent proposals for increasing family income and enhancing the welfare of our farmers, fisherfolk, industrial workers, and urban poor. We seek legislation to improve the urban poor\u2019s easier access to decent and affordable housing. And I ask this Congress to continue its predecessor\u2019s work of setting the framework of agrarian reform and modernizing agriculture\u2014as the foundation of industrialization and sustainable, broad-based development. I ask you to give maximum legislative support towards the increase of the Agrarian Reform Fund, and to pass the Irrigation Crisis Act, if we are to make our small farmers competitive in the world. Furthermore, I urge Congress not to pass any legislation exempting more lands from the coverage of agrarian reform. I also ask Congress to pass the Fisheries Code, a law long delayed and eagerly awaited by our fisherfolks. We must also reach out to our indigenous peoples, so they can take part in our communal effort at development without losing their cultural identity. I ask this Congress to establish a Cordillera Consultative Commission to pave the way for a Cordillera Autonomous Region, and to pass the bill on ancestral domain, so that we can respond to our indigenous peoples\u2019 clamor for the recognition of their ancestral lands. Our Muslim communities we must bring faster into the nation\u2019s mainstream by providing a greater share of the resources for infrastructure and human resource development. On environmental protection, I ask this Congress to enact the proposed codes on forestry, the environment and land use. We must institutionalize our common conviction that nature is not something to be abused\u2014but God\u2019s blessing to be enhanced. God intended man to live in harmony with nature\u2014not to ravage it. But protecting nature and fighting pollution starts with the citizenry\u2014by keeping our homes, premises, and communities clean and green.\r\nOur foreign policy today rests on three pillars: political security, economic diplomacy, and protection of Filipinos overseas. In recent weeks, I have ordered policy and procedural reforms to all government agencies and foreign missions concerned so that we can respond more promptly, adequately, and effectively to the concerns, problems, and difficulties of our new heroes\u2014our overseas workers, of whom there are 4 million. Our \u201cdiplomacy for development\u201d has brought dividends in trade, investments\u2014and goodwill\u2014while renewing our friendships in the world. We initiated Southeast Asia\u2019s newest growth quadrangle\u2014the East ASEAN Growth Area [EAGA]. As a founding member of the World Trade Organization, an urgent task of Congress is to further harmonize our trade, investment, agricultural, and industrial policies with our commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement. This year we chair the Group of 77 consisting of 135 nations and we have a key role in the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM]. Next year, we shall host the leaders\u2019 summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], at which venue, we will continue to champion the development of the human resources of our 18-member economies, believing that every economy should make human beings the center of its concerns.\r\nThe Armed Forces Modernization Program enacted by the Ninth Congress enables us to improve our capability to defend our national territory, and to enhance our influence in promoting regional security cooperation. In undertaking the program, self-reliance will continue to be our guiding principle. This we will push to new heights by matching research with technology upgrading and production expansion in-country. But far more than merely acquiring or installing the latest equipment, the development of our human resources is the most meaningful component of our defense modernization. We need dedicated soldiers and highly trained, forward-looking men and women in the ladder of command.\r\nOur relations with the United States, we must place on an even keel\u2014on the basis of \u201ctrade, not aid\u201d\u2014removing the residual bitterness of her departure from Philippine bases. On our dispute with China over Mischief Reef and the conflicting claims on the South China Sea, we have worked consistently to prevent this issue from breaking out into open conflict, while proving to the world that we are prepared to defend our borders. In recent weeks, our diplomats have pushed for consensus on a code of conduct in the South China Sea that all claimants will respect. In Japan, far-reaching economic changes seem imminent, which should further open its markets to our products and bring a fresh wave of Japanese investments into our country. In Southeast Asia, recent events carry forward our hopes for the eventual integration of its 10 countries. Vietnam is poised to become a member of ASEAN. Laos is already an ASEAN observer country. Cambodia has acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. And with the encouraging developments in Myanmar, we hope it too would soon be drawn into the ASEAN process. Together with our friends in the world, we must work for the reform of the United Nations system\u2014to make it a more effective instrument for multilateral peacekeeping. We seek the Senate\u2019s concurrence on various treaties\u2014all aimed at enhancing our economic, social, political, technological, and cultural contacts in the global community.\r\nFinally, let me say a few words about the importance of good governance which is the foundation of sustained development. We have turned around precisely because we first put the house of government in order, and created a better climate for cooperation between the legislative and executive branches. I cannot overemphasize our need to improve government\u2019s capacity and effectiveness. Our ultimate object is to assert the rule of law\u2014to replace privilege with effectiveness, and establish the social cohesion and legal equality that characterize a working democracy.\r\nThe Ninth Congress passed into history without acting on the bill on emergency powers to streamline the entire executive branch. I trust this Tenth Congress will have the will to do so. Management teachers remind us that there is a difference between efficiency and effectiveness. The public agency and the public servant can be efficient for as long as they fulfill their mandate within the law\u2014even if that law is already outdated. Effectiveness, on the other hand, has to do with meeting objectives at the appointed hour. Effectiveness is doing the right thing at the right time. In its present condition, our bureaucracy is saddled with structures and systems fit only for a bygone age. An old bureaucratic joke asks the simple question: \u201cIf it takes two ditch-diggers two days to dig a ditch, how long would it take four ditch-diggers?\u201d the logical answer should be one day. but\u2014in real, bureaucratic life\u2014the correct answer is probably \u201cfour days\u201d or perhaps forever. Indeed, we have made government the employer of last resort. By constant addition without regard to objectives, we have assembled a workforce too big to be effective\u2014a workforce that spends an increasing amount of its time reworking rather than working, and undoing rather than doing. To fully support local government units in their effort to deliver basic services, we ask Congress to correct the imbalance between their financial resources and the actual cost of devolution to local government units [LGUs] under the Local Government Code.\r\nI turn now to the key legislative reform I commend to this Congress for 1995 which is tax reform. As we move towards the 21st century, we must establish a Progressive Tax System capable of funding the inevitable requirements of development and modernization while simultaneously relieving the burden from our poorer sectors. We must simplify our tax system, broaden its base, lower its rates, make it more progressive, economically efficient, and socially equitable; and eliminate areas of discretion that all too often lead to graft and corruption. In this reform effort, we need not adopt new tax measures. We can efficiently enforce or modify existing ones, rationalize our convoluted incentives system, improve collection efficiency, and strengthen our capability to prosecute and put behind bars tax cheats and tax frauds.\r\nTax reform will also generate a recurring flow of funds we need to invest in human capital\u2014in improving the health, housing, education, skills, and productivity of our workpeople. Families stranded in low-income occupations cannot prepare their children to be the productive citizens of tomorrow. We must help those children gain access to opportunities for self-improvement. In practice, the \u201cequality\u201d the Constitution guarantees becomes a mere abstraction without a minimum amount of economic equality in terms of housing, of health care, of basic education. The poor are the focal point of government\u2019s social services, which are of course financed through the taxation of the more comfortable and affluent among us. Those of us who still regard the state as no more than a night watchman\u2014whose only duty is to safeguard private property\u2014live in an era long gone. If Philippine society is to become just and stable\u2014if Philippine society is truly to transform itself\u2014then we must ease the extremes of poverty and wealth left over to us from the ironies of history.\r\nMr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: On the eve of our Centennial of Philippine Independence, we find ourselves at the threshold of far-reaching change\u2014change that promises to fulfill the dreams of our heroic generation of 1892-98. Not only the world has changed. The very basics of human and economic development have changed. The ability to create knowledge is rapidly replacing manufacturing power as the crucial factor among competitive economies. Information technology [IT] is the highway of the future, which compels the enactment of laws to promote this new sector of opportunity and challenges our science and business leaders to create our export niche for information technology products. We cannot remake this country without tearing open the old blinders and throwing away the old formulas. We will continue to develop only if we adapt and innovate continuously.\r\nMany so-called \u201cthinkers\u201d make a profession of predicting the collapse of all our endeavors. The best reply to these prophets of doom is the continued success of our programs. Once upon a time, democracy was a millstone around our neck. Both those who sought to subvert the Philippine State\u2014and those who sought to stop reform\u2014used democracy\u2019s means to bring Philippine democracy down. Philippine-style democracy is our competitive edge today, because democracy\u2014by awakening and mobilizing ordinary people to the possibilities of their lives\u2014enlarges tremendously our talent pool of enterprise, knowledge, and productivity. But let us not forget that the democratic way\u2014by enlarging the latitude for debate and dissension\u2014also demands harder work, greater cohesiveness, and social responsibility from everyone of us. If our democracy is to adapt to the dynamism\u2014of society, culture, and politics\u2014which is the wave of the future, then it must become more pervasive, more participatory. And government itself must become \u201cuser-friendly.\u201d Its ruling principle must be to devolve, decentralize, deregulate, and democratize.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: In the drive to make our democracy work, we of the executive branch and you of the legislature must lead and achieve. I also urge those in media to enhance public awareness of our reform programs while they continue their support and impartial reporting of national issues. Let us remind ourselves that to achieve great deeds, we must not only plan and act\u2014we must also believe in a shared vision towards which all our energy, talent, and time must converge. At our centennial in 1998, I want to see, as surely you do, our people in command of their destiny, secure in their values\u2014yet creative enough, audacious enough to meet new challenges with productive solutions. I want to see, as surely you of the Tenth Congress also do, the beauty and richness of our land and our seas fully restored\u2014a gift from this\u2014our\u2014generation to the future ones. And I want to see, as we all do, the glow of peace and hope and joy light up the face of every Filipino.\r\nMga mahal na kababayan: Pagsapit ng sandaang taon ng ating kasarinlan sa 1998, pangarap nating magkaroon ang ating mga kababayan ng sapat na kakayahang hubugin ang kanilang kinabukasan\u2014matibay ang loob at malikhain ang isipan upang tugunan ang anumang suliranin. Pangarap nating maibalik ang ganda at yaman ng ating lupain, kabundukan, at karagatan bilang ating pamana sa mga darating pang salinlahi. Pangarap nating makita muli ang liwanag ng kapayapaan sa ating bayan at pag-asa, sigla, at karangalan ng bawat mamamayang Pilipino.\r\nSalamat sa inyong lahat.\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas!!!", "title": "The Best Is Soon to Come"},
{"delivered": "1992-07-27 13:15:30+00:00", "author": "Fidel V. Ramos", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1992]\r\n\r\nMr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; Vice President Joseph Estrada; Chief Justice Andres Narvasa; the distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; honored guests; fellow workers in government.\r\nThis afternoon my traffic escorts saw to it that the delay, because of bad weather, floods on the streets was exactly for one hour in order not to disrupt the schedule of the Joint Session of Congress.\r\nToday we begin our joint and complementary efforts to discharge government\u2019s sworn duty to our people and our country.\r\nOrdinarily, this occasion has for its time frame the year just past and the year unfolding.\r\nBut for us, this gathering has a more transcendent meaning. For it also begins our terms of office. And that cannot but enlarge our horizon as we survey the state of the nation.\r\nI stand here to ask for the support of Congress and to offer my hand in a partnership of patriotism and progress between the executive and the legislative. Our Constitution specifies separate powers and responsibilities for Congress and the presidency\u2014as distinct and coequal branches of government. Yet our Charter also reminds us we are not rivals for power, but partners in serving the national interest.\r\nThough there are tasks that only the executive or the legislature must carry out, we are both trustees of a common heritage, a common interest, and a common purpose.\r\nWe stand on the threshold of destiny. The end of my term will coincide with the centennial of our declaration of independence. Six years hence, the governments this nation has endured will pass in review and receive the judgment of history. They will be asked what they will do, what they did with the country\u2019s independence. My administration will be the last before the centennial. That is my luck, for it will naturally receive the closest scrutiny. It is not only the spirit of independence that will demand a reckoning. In the next six years, the nation will commemorate other great centennials: the Cry of Pugad Lawin, the Battle of Pinaglabanan, the execution of Rizal. One hundred years of sacrifice and struggle. The ghosts of a generation of founding heroes shall step from their monuments to demand an accounting of the legacy they left behind.\r\nIn this spirit, I come here today to report to you on the state of the nation; and to tell you of the course I propose we follow in meeting our shared responsibility.\r\nTwenty-eight days ago, I entered into the presidency. Since then, my principal object has been to know all that one can possibly know\u2014in that brief time\u2014of the problems facing the nation, the opportunities open to us, and the support we can count on from our people and from our friends in the world. I shall not pretend that my administration now knows all the answers. Nor that we now have all the requisites to meet every problem and every contingency. But this much is clear to me: Though our problems are grave, we are much better placed to address them than our predecessors were, a year or so ago.\r\nThough obstacles may shadow our labors, we have the crucial requisite for surmounting them: and that is the combined resolve of our people and their elected representatives to join together and face all problems and all dangers.\r\nI see our task not in terms of any specific problem but in the light of the purposes of union enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution:\r\nTo build a just and humane society and establish a government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality and peace.\r\nSome of these hopes have attained a measure of fulfillment under the past administration and the last Congress.\r\nCertainly we are today a nation confirmed in our constitutional democracy: strengthened by the trials we have weathered.\r\nConsiderable stability has been attained in the economy\u2014as efforts at stabilization, restructuring, and reform over the last six years have borne fruit.\r\nBut our people still live under the weight of many problems. The indicators of national life tell us just how heavy is this burden: The top 20% of Filipino families receives 50% of our country\u2019s total household income; the lowest 20% receives only 5%. At least 5.8 million families\u2014over half of all our households\u2014do not earn enough to meet their basic needs.\r\nIn 1991, some 2.3 million of our workers were jobless; and 7.6 million of those who had jobs were working less than 40 hours a week.\r\nMeanwhile, 860,000 young people join the labor force every year.\r\nThese severities of economic life translate into grave problems in politics and social life.\r\nToday we are one of a few countries burdened with the combined weight of communist insurgency and other rebellions.\r\nCrime makes our streets unsafe, and threatens our citizens in their homes.\r\nSocial services have lagged behind the rise of population and the mass migration to our cities of poor rural people. Neighborhoods are deteriorating and too many families are without adequate housing. Our education and health services are under unbearable strain.\r\nAnd every day that we delay meeting these problems, they grow more intractable.\r\nThe test is whether we can act with dispatch to answer these challenges\u2014not tomorrow but today.\r\nPeace and security are the first urgent problem. For as long as instability and uncertainty characterize our common life, we shall not make any headway. This is why in my inaugural address I immediately raised the issue of amnesty to enable rebels to reenter civil society as law-abiding citizens.\r\nOur goal must be to attain a just, comprehensive, peaceful, and lasting resolution of the internal armed conflict that has cost the nation and our people so dearly.\r\nThis effort must go hand in hand with the thrust of my government to institute basic reforms to root out the causes of rebellion.\r\nAfter lengthy consultations within the government and the private sector, I am now prepared to take the following steps.\r\nFirst, I am submitting to Congress today an amnesty proclamation that will cover some 4,500 former rebels\u20142,100 former members of the CPP-NPA and 2,400 former members of the MNLF\u2014who have already applied for amnesty under Executive Order No. 350, promulgated on March 13, 1989, as well as those who may still wish to apply for amnesty under this Executive Order. I ask for immediate Congressional concurrence.\r\nThis grant of amnesty is the initial step in a comprehensive peace and unification process that shall address the problem of bringing back all other rebels to the fold of the law. I therefore invite both chambers of Congress to join the executive in constituting a National Unification Commission, that will include representatives of the private sector. This commission will undertake extensive consultations with concerned sectors of society, including rebel groups, in order to formulate a viable amnesty program and the process that will lead to a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace.\r\nAnd before i proceed any further let me sign in your presence my Letter of Transmittal of Proclamation No. 10 to the Honorable Senate President and to the Honorable Speaker of the House as follows:\r\nI transmit herewith Proclamation no. 10 titled \u201cGranting amnesty in favor of persons who have filed or will file application for amnesty under EO no. 350 Series of 1989 for your concurrence pursuant to Sec. 19, Article no. 7 of the Constitution.\r\nThe committee must submit its findings and recommendations within 90 days.\r\nI have also directed the Secretaries of Justice, Defense, and Interior and Local Government to review the cases of so-called rebels under detention or serving sentence and to recommend as soon as possible who can be released through administrative action, granted executive clemency, or recommended for release under bail, with the end in view of further creating a favorable climate for national unity.\r\nFinally, I ask Congress to repeal Republic Act No. 1700, as amended, so that the Communist Party of the Philippines and similar organizations will no longer be outlawed but allowed to compete freely, openly, and peacefully in the political, economic, and social arena instead of their following the path of the armed struggle.\r\nPeace is a process. And we must all join hands to bind and heal the conflicts that have so long divided and held us back.\r\nCrime is the other problem that endangers our peace.\r\nWhen public order breaks down; when men, women and children fear for their safety in the streets and in their homes; when contempt and mistrust characterize citizens\u2019 attitudes toward lawful authority; then we all\u2014young and old, rich, and poor\u2014are victimized.\r\nThese past 28 days show what we can do once the will is there. The creation of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission is only the beginning. More is required to eradicate this plague in our society.\r\nFirst, I ask congress to restore the death penalty to cover heinous crimes, which of late have enjoyed a resurgence\u2014encouraged, no doubt, by the weakness of our deterrents.\r\nSecond, let us deal decisively with the scalawags in uniform by doubling the penalties for law enforcers and military personnel who commit criminal acts. And let us in the same measure provide incentives and rewards for public servants in uniform who show dedication and skill.\r\nI saw many of them out in the flooded streets of Quezon City and Manila as I was coming here this afternoon.\r\nThird, let us improve our institutional and professional capability for crime prevention and crime suspension at both national and local levels. These measures should include a stricter firearms control law and more effective actions by our peace and order councils.\r\nIn the economy, let us move forward from stabilization and restructuring to measures and policies designed for growth. One step above all is essential: the formulation of a national midterm development plan for the six years from 1993 to 1998. In the framing of this plan, I invite the participation of Congress; and this can be facilitated by the speedy creation of a Legislative-Executive Development Council, which I recommend to you.\r\nI shall soon submit to Congress the proposed national budget for fiscal year 1993.\r\nThrough the budget, we shall pump-prime the economy; stimulate growth by focusing public investments on programs with the highest productive and economic returns; and provide social services and productivity programs that will empower the majority among us who are now without the means to lead decent and useful lives, particularly the farming, fishing, and labor sectors.\r\nInfrastructure building we must push aggressively. This will not only create jobs in the countryside. It will also give investors proof of our resolve to provide growth a solid foundation for sustainable development.\r\nOur priorities are communications, arterial highways, local and national roads, major bridges, urban highways, and major water conservation and flood control projects.\r\nFor efficiency and continuity, all these should be provided multiyear funding. We shall also tap private resources under the build-operate-transfer and similar schemes. To liberalize the private sector\u2019s entry into the transport industry, it will be necessary to amend the 50-year old public service law.\r\nTo finance this infrastructure program, we shall be unrelenting in collecting what is due the government in taxes, duties, and other revenues. This can be attained primarily by cracking down on tax evaders. Tax evasion can be curbed if we can show that tax evaders\u2014whoever they may be\u2014will not go undetected and unpunished.\r\nBut let me also tell you now that we cannot make do with our present revenue base. Development has a price that must be paid.\r\nAnd we shall submit to you a set of revenue proposals that will enable us to pay this price equitably.\r\nOn debt management, we are adopting a growth-oriented strategy, to contain our obligatory burden of debt servicing.\r\nI assure you we shall also be much more assertive in negotiating with our creditors to gain better terms.\r\nSome members of Congress have expressed anxiety about my decision to sign the new restructuring agreement that the past administration had reached with private creditors. But let me tell you that to forego this agreement would have meant stalling our forward movement and going back to square one\u2014without any assurance that we can renegotiate let alone get better terms.\r\nTo maintain economic stability, we need continued fiscal and monetary discipline. We intend to keep the budget deficit within manageable and acceptable levels.\r\nBy adhering to this austere monetary program, we should be able to keep down inflation to a single digit throughout the rest of the year and beyond.\r\nAlongside the monetary program, we need to improve the fiscal position of the Central Bank.\r\nThese measures will set the stage for strengthening the financial system\u2014and bring down the regime of high interest rates. We should then be able to mobilize development financing for both agriculture and industry\u2014not just through government financial institutions but primarily through the private banking system, whose business that ought to be.\r\nIn energy, we have moved with speed to moderate the crisis. But a new Department of Energy is still imperative\u2014to make sure our experience of long brownouts during the past several months is never repeated and our long-term energy needs are met.\r\nThis new department will plan, implement, coordinate, and supervise all policies and programs on energy. The law we propose will also establish an energy development fund to be sourced from the Oil Price Stabilization Fund.\r\nIn trade, we expect a rise in export demand as our major markets return to growth. You can count on the executive to do all we can to make our industries worldwide competitive.\r\nThis means gradually abolishing all remaining quantitative restrictions on trade, liberalizing the foreign exchange market, and adopting a more realistic foreign exchange rate.\r\nIn support of the Foreign Investments Act, I ask Congress to amend the Condominium Law and liberalize nationality requirements in the Omnibus Investment Code. The objective is to make foreign companies secure in the possession of their plant sites in industrial estates.\r\nWe shall also review the present system of incentives to make it more attractive and encourage the flow of investments into the economy.\r\nAll our policies for growth will have a deep concern for protecting our environment. Our natural surroundings must be the beneficiary of modernization, not its victim.\r\nI urge this Congress to take up anew the ban on logging which should, however, consider the possibility of identifying the areas where logging can be permitted under the concept of sustainable development.\r\nI am also submitting for your urgent action an Environment Protection Code and a new Forestry Code to institutionalize the control by local communities over forests within their territories.\r\nThese measures will in time move the economy back to growth. But let us not imagine that growth by itself will suffice to bring the poor majority of our countrymen and communities into the mainstream of development.\r\nIf we are to substantially reduce poverty in the Philippines, economic policy in the large must become sensitive to the well-being of the majority among us who are without the means to enjoy decent and useful lives.\r\nWithin the week, I will sign an Executive Order creating a President\u2019s Commission to fight poverty, which shall gather under one umbrella all government activities designed to help our poor households and communities so that they catch up with the more progressive ones.\r\nWe shall undertake three main types of intervention against poverty: The first is to ensure the delivery of basic social services to the poorest communities and to make sure that every poor family has a decent minimum of health, nutrition, housing, and education. The second is to see to it that the poor gain access to agrarian reform, skills training, and extension services that will open up livelihood opportunities and jobs to them. And the third is to help poor communities organize cooperatively to empower them to play a greater role in their own development and to make their voices heard in the making of public policy.\r\nWe must, in sum, depart from the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d policies of the past, which had only left our poor farmer and other communities farther behind,\u00a0and move into a policy of \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d to lift them up and equip them with the humanities of life. Government will set itself not just theoretical but measurable standards for gauging its success in easing poverty year after year.\r\nTo act in this way for our poor is to assert the timeless principle that if we are to develop, we must invest in people. For our nation can rise only to the level of our people\u2019s competence. The most profitable human investment is in basic education. I urge Congress to pass a bill on elementary education for the purpose of insuring universal and higher quality elementary education to the end that every Filipino child has access to a quality public elementary school. It will also ensure exposure of our young to technical and scientific knowledge. There are still thousands of barangays today that do not have elementary schools. In addition, we must upgrade the quality of instruction, textbooks, and school facilities. In sum, we must give the highest priority to elementary education in our spending program. To stress this is not to ignore the requirements of public secondary and higher education. These also merit our attention. But we must recognize that to bring our educational system into the mainstream of national renewal, we must begin at the beginning by making sure that every Filipino child has an elementary school within easy reach and that our young people are exposed to technical and scientific learning. We have to learn to talk of growth not in terms of statistics, but in terms of people: in the child we save from hunger and raise to knowledge, in the citizen we raise to a life of dignity and well-being, in the woman we raise to her true place in our society, in the community that we transform from distress into a net contributor to national vitality, and in a national culture that truly reflects and appreciates the native talent and resourcefulness of the Filipino. It has become a cliche, but it is nonetheless true: Real development has a human face.\r\nWe have missed perhaps this human dimension in our labors because government has become too big and has spread itself too thin. Over the last 28 days, one thing has become plain to me. For us to get anywhere, we need to remodel the very machinery of government. We have to reorganize the civil service so that it can do more\u2014and do better. We must rationalize the public corporate sector by privatizing those of its operations which are better undertaken by private enterprise. And we must devolve and decentralize more of national administration so that government truly reaches out to our citizenry, wherever they may live in our vast archipelago.\r\nThis effort can be propelled only by definitive support from Congress. Since the reorganization will affect most of the cabinet departments, it does not make sense for us to reorganize piecemeal.\r\nI would urge Congress therefore to consider one comprehensive \u201cGovernment Reorganization Act\u201d that will enable us to streamline the entire executive branch, including the Office of the President.\r\nOur goal here is to promote speed in decision making and action that yields quality results; and to increase effectiveness and impact in government operations despite funding constraints.\r\nWe envision the following as integral parts of this reorganization program: (1) implementation of the law on attrition; (2) realignment of agency mandates by abolishing nonessential functions including vacant positions; (3) integration of all attaches and offices abroad; and (4) reduction of the number of departments and agencies.\r\nSome have mistakenly thought that this is a request for blanket authority for the president in reorganization. What we seek is a law that will fully enable us to reorganize the executive branch. Others fear that reorganization will result in massive layoffs. This is not envisioned at all. The only ones who have to fear displacement are 15 to 30 employees and all those who do not possess civil service eligibilities.\r\nReorganization and professionalization of the civil service will greatly strengthen our hand in checking graft. But we shall not rely only on these reforms, nor on the independent work of the ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan.\r\nAs I proposed in my inaugural address, we must take action against both the bribe-taker and the bribe-giver. Surely we must be more aggressive against those who pay grease money to facilitate transactions with government. We will provide the ombudsman all the assistance in carrying out a successful campaign against graft and corruption.\r\nIn aid of this campaign, I urge Congress to pass a bill which addresses economic crimes and heavily penalizes graft and corruption. The bill could be patterned after the well-known RICO statute in the United States.\r\nThe overriding principle we must establish in government is that only by joint action\u2014at national and local level\u2014can we ever hope to achieve our goals and aspirations.\r\nWhile many of our problems are national in scope, they exist in neighborhoods and local communities. Hence, the solutions must in the end be tailored to local needs.\r\nWhile our problems require a broad national strategy and the political will to attack them, our response must be enriched by local perspectives and private sector participation.\r\nNo program\u2014no matter how generously funded\u2014an hope to uproot problems if it is based or developed solely in Manila. It must be founded on the life and experience of our local communities and enhanced by private sector involvement.\r\nThis is why we must move with dispatch. This is why I have established extension offices of the presidency in the Visayas and Mindanao. We must translate into reality the principles embodied in the landmark Local Government Code of 1991.\r\nPrecisely because decentralization departs drastically from tradition, we must nurture the process of change to ensure our local governments are empowered to cope, not just by law but by our aid and intervention in Congress and the executive.\r\nFinally, I want to endorse in the strongest terms the passage of an act strengthening the Metro Manila Authority.\r\nTo live in Metro Manila today is literally a punishment\u2014to exist with garbage, smog, traffic congestion, flood, and substandard public services. The atomized jurisdictions in the metropolis cannot deal with problems that are collective in nature. The only answer is a metropolitan administration that will deliver basic services effectively to all of Metro Manila.\r\nAnd it should be an administration headed by an appointive Metro Manila governor. No one should fear by such title the emergence of a new political personality who will dwarf elected Metro officials. His will be a strictly service-oriented office, nonelective, and fully subject to recall by the test of effectiveness.\r\nIn foreign relations, we must chart our course in a world\u2014and an Asia-Pacific region\u2014much changed by recent events. The end of the Cold War may have eased the danger of a nuclear confrontation. But, ironically, the loosening of big-power tensions makes more likely the breaking out of quarrels within the region\u2014which the superpowers once restrained, for fear of getting involved in them. Fortunately, there are few such quarrels threatening our part of the world. For the moment, securing continued access to world markets and technology must become the most vital concern of ourselves and our regional partners.\r\nWe have started reorienting our diplomatic service, to focus it on foreign trade and investment\u2014in a word, to make it a tool of our effort at export-oriented development.\r\nTo the extent consistent with our constitutional responsibilities, let us together frame our foreign policy in a spirit of bipartisanship. And let it be truly national in character.\r\nOur external defense we had implicitly entrusted to the Americans, under an a military assistance agreement and a military bases agreement with the United States. This had enabled us to get away with the smallest defense investment in ASEAN. Those agreements have already lapsed.\r\nNow we must take up the responsibility for our own defense. Most urgently, the capabilities of both our Navy and our Air Force must make a quantum leap. And we shall have to accelerate our entire self-reliance program for the armed forces. Fortunately, this program will have beneficial side effects that are more than just military\u2014in the transfer of technology, in job generation, and even in the potential export of defense products.\r\nI believe\u2014with all my heart\u2014that our people and our country can be sure, now more than ever, of the loyalty, dedication and efficiency of their armed forces and national police. Let us give our soldiers and policemen the support they deserve.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress: It is time to view our nation afresh\u2014to see it the way our revolutionary heroes must have seen it at its birth\u2014as a nation in which the common good is attainable. For too many years, we have defined our national life in ways contrary to our unity and progress. We have defined our politics in terms of conflict and competition: it is time we defined it in terms of cooperation and union. We have defined economic effort in terms of profit and self-interest: It is time we defined it in terms of sharing and caring. We have defined our culture in terms of jealous provincialism: It is time we defined it in terms of pride and linkage\u2014taking what we can from the best of others, and giving what we can of our best to them. We the Congress and the executive can provide the example and the leadership for such cooperation, sharing, and linkage. You and I can act separately\u2014and achieve very very little. Or you and I can act together\u2014and achieve much, much more. The time is short and our responsibility is clear. In our hands, ladies and gentlemen of Congress, is the opportunity to turn the remaining years of this century into the resurgence of the Filipino nation. We have it in our power to achieve this goal. We also have it in our power to lose this chance\u2014and condemn our country to continued decline and failure. I know we shall not fail. I know that we shall do all we can\u2014severally and together\u2014to make our stewardship of government a good one for our people and our country. The need is here. The need is now. Let us not allow our troubles to disperse our men and women all over the world\u2014to be the housemaids and janitors of more fortunate peoples. Let our problems rather bind us together in one concerted action to banish the sorrows of the past, confront the difficulties of the present, and redeem the promise of the future. And when our collaboration shall have produced the prosperity and well-being of our people and our country, then might we say we have lived up to the sacred oaths with which we entered office. And our people will say to us\u2014well done. Thank you and good day.\r\nMaraming salamat po sa inyong lahat.", "title": "Reform, Change, and Growth"},
{"delivered": "1996-07-22 01:20:21+00:00", "author": "Fidel V. Ramos", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on\u00a0July 22, 1996]\r\nFour years ago, when I first stood before this legislature to report on the state of the nation, we could only see the future dimly\u2014and not just because our provinces and cities were darkened by an electric power crisis. All that you and I knew then was that there are no easy answers\u2014no quick fixes\u2014for our ills. And the only things that sustained us were our belief that crisis can make heroes out of ordinary people\u2014and our faith that we Filipinos can be greater than the sum of all our problems. Today, the challenge is to complete our victory over pessimism, stagnation, and decline. Today, the challenge is to give our next generation of leaders a firm foundation on which to build peace and prosperity for all our people. The correctness of our reforms so far has been validated by the growth of the economy and a new tempo of nationwide self-reliance, even at the grassroots, as expressed in our battlecry:\r\n\u201cKaya ito ng Pinoy! Kayang-kaya!!\u201d\r\nWe have demonstrated our own capability to manage our economy towards stability and sustained growth\u2014earning the respect of the global economic community and making it unnecessary for us to depend on the IMF\u2019s \u201cSeal of Good Housekeeping.\u201d Next year, we shall end 30 years of stringent economic programs under the IMF\u2019s watchful eyes\u2014and asserting full responsibility and credit for managing our economic growth and development into the 21st century. The IMF cites three reasons why our economy has overcome its historical cycles of boom and bust: First, growth today is being boosted by exports and investments\u2014and not by consumer spending or government pump-priming. Second, growth is being accompanied by some increase in private savings and not necessarily by increasing external debt or foreign loans. Third, the economy has become more resilient to economic shocks.\r\nI say it is written even more vividly in the lives of individual Filipinos and their communities. Growth corridors, clusters, and centers all over the country are stirring ordinary Filipinos to new vigor,\u00a0new ventures,\u00a0new lives for themselves and their children. There still is great poverty among us, but every time we touch one family with our livelihood and social service programs; every time a quality job gives one worker a higher sense of dignity; every time we transform a Smokey Mountain into a decent place for human beings, then we loosen the iron grip poverty has on our people. The work of completion\u2014of policies, programs, and projects\u2014will define these last two years of my term. We must keep accelerating growth and social equity until they become self-sustaining.\r\nIn agriculture, to guarantee productivity and profitability of our primary producers, we must speed up building irrigation systems, farm-to-market roads, postharvest facilities; increase the flow of credit to our farmers, fisherfolk, and rural entrepreneurs; and optimize the role of women in agriculture. These must go hand-in-hand with our continuing effort to equip our farmers and those who make their living from the sea with the latest in technology. All these efforts should assure our food security and self-sufficiency. In energy and water, we must deliver electric power and potable water to our remotest barangays and humblest households. In this regard, we need more time to get the build-operate-transfer [BOT) and privatization proposals in place since water-related projects are much more complicated and take more time to put together than those in electric power. We can continue to fast-track needed water projects if certain provisions of the Water Crisis Act are extended. We Filipinos do not subscribe to the \u201cgrow now, clean up later\u201d approach of some of the countries that have industrialized ahead of us. We are cleaning up as we grow: We intend to live up to the distinction given by\r\nlast May of being the world\u2019s first emerging \u201cgreen tiger.\u201d I therefore ask Congress to pass the Environment Code that is still pending in the two chambers. As we strive for development compatible with the carrying capacity of our ecosystem, we shall need a clear basis for allocating our lands to various competing uses. I urge Congress to pass\u2014within this session\u2014the National Land Use Bill. Likewise, I call the attention of Congress to the need for a continuing population program. You will recall that four years ago, we adopted the Philippine Population Program that aims to improve the quality of life through rational population growth balanced with the sustainable capacity of the environment and resources to support.\r\nWe are also reviewing the institutional, policy, and funding support for our small and medium enterprises [SMEs]\u2014which have long been the \u201cmissing middle link\u201d in our economy. The Magna Carta for Small Enterprises increased the loanable funds set aside by the banking sector for SMEs from about P16 billion in 1992 to some P80 billion during the past four years\u2014but this has not been quite enough. Our export gains show we can compete globally. While our traditional markets\u2014the United States and Japan\u2014still account for more than half of all our exports, the volume and value of the goods that we ship to ASEAN and to East Asia are rising notably. Last year, our exports to ASEAN increased by 66%, and those to South Korea by 51%. Government must, in tandem with the private sector, upgrade our research and development facilities in the emerging technologies to enable us to add higher value to our export products. Over these next two years, we should complete our efforts to shift our exports from so-called high-volume standard products to high-value customized goods and services. We now project exports to grow not anymore at an average annual rate of 20% but at 25%\u2014to reach $50 billion by the year 2000.\r\nEmployment levels too have been growing steadily since 1992. But since our workforce is growing at virtually the same rate as we are creating jobs, all our efforts have cut down unemployment and underemployment only marginally. We are, however, seeing improvements in the quality of jobs, and industrial peace keeps on getting better. The marked decline in strikes continues: Nationwide, they dropped below the 100-mark in both 1994 and 1995. But we must pursue a renewed, more vigorous, more focused effort to generate new jobs of the kind that assure our workers and their families stable incomes and improving quality of life. As for our overseas workers, we have made it a primary mission of our embassies to safeguard their persons and their rights. Our foreign office is even now engaged in several bilateral and multilateral negotiations on their behalf.\r\nWe have expanded our social reform agenda to cover not just the 20 poorest provinces in the Philippines but all 78 provinces and 16 administrative regions because we are giving special attention also to fifth- and sixth-class municipalities, where the bulk of our poor are to be found. In addition to being responsible for cleaning and greening their frontyards and backyards, I have also made local government executives accountable for the reduction of poverty in their respective provinces, cities, and municipalities. By the end of this year, we expect to graduate at least four provinces from the \u201cpoorest\u201d category. For the first time, we are using an anti-poverty yardstick which we call the MBN [minimum basic needs] to measure how much is actually spent on poverty alleviation. Our budget proposal for 1997, which I am submitting today, contains explicit anti-poverty provisions. In public health, we have raised average life expectancy from 67.5 years in 1992 to 69.1 years in 1995; and cut down infant mortality, which is the most sensitive index of socioeconomic development from 53 per thousand live births in 1992 to 47 in 1995, and malnourishment among children of preschool age\u2014from 14% in 1992 to 7% in 1995. In addition to our \u201cDoctors to the Barrio program\u201d to insure the delivery of health services to distant areas, we have pursued innovative and preventive health care programs which have gained worldwide recognition. In basic education, we have achieved almost universal access to elementary and high schools over the past four years. Now we are beginning to modernize our school system\u2014both by providing them high-tech means to broaden pupils\u2019 access to information and knowledge, and enhancing teacher training processes, especially in mathematics, science, and technology. But we still have a long way to go by the standards of our vigorous neighbors. While we have provided 3,500 scholarship slots per year to train students to become technicians, scientists, and engineers, we should at least treble this number in the next two years. In agrarian reform, we have achieved significant progress during the last four years in the distribution of agricultural land to our landless farmers. Nonetheless, we are only halfway to our final target for land distribution. We have to speed up the land distribution and productivity program between now and 1998, and Congress must both increase the ceiling of the Agrarian Reform Fund and expand its sources, and improve the adjudication system for agrarian reform. Other priority measures long awaited by our basic sectors include the proposed Fisheries Code for our fisherfolks, the Bill on Ancestral Domain for our indigenous peoples, and the repeal of Presidential Decree 772 which would decriminalize squatting and address the issues regarding the resettlement of the urban poor.\r\nWe seek stronger protection of the integrity of the Filipino family as the building block of the national community, and to guard the basic rights particularly of women, children, and young people, indigenous\r\n, the handicapped, the aged, and our veterans. In our programs for human resource development and as a prerequisite to sustainable development, we consider protecting Filipino children and empowering Filipino women among our highest priorities. As part of these efforts, we ask from this Congress the passage of the comprehensive juvenile justice system and a total approach against dangerous drugs\u2014from education to prevention to law enforcement to rehabilitation to international cooperation\u2014with the Department of Justice [DOJ] as the lead agency instead of the Department of Health [DOH]. We also seek the establishment of child and family courts to facilitate the speedy disposition of child abuse and family relations cases. Protection of the family and social integration of the marginalized sectors, especially disadvantaged women, also call for the passage of several other bills, including one long overdue which reclassifies rape as a crime not only against chastity but against a person. We are the first country, in fact, after the United Nations Conference on Women held in Beijing last September 1995, to direct all government agencies to set aside at least 5% of their budgets for gender equality concerns for the benefit of Filipino women.\r\nIn our drive against crime, we are making some progress\u2014in reducing crime incidence, in improving our crime-fighting capabilities, and in fighting violent crimes. We have also made substantial gains in further reducing kidnapping and bank robberies, with better cooperation now resulting from community participation in crime prevention and information gathering. On the other hand, there is no longer any reason to delay action on the pending bills modernizing the Philippine National Police [PNP] and the Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP]. More than just replacing aging equipment and providing our units and personnel with the wherewithal with which to carry out their missions, boosting their morale is even more important. We are therefore committed to upgrade the equipment, training, and pay scales of our military and law enforcement personnel, including those of the National Bureau of Investigation and the state prosecution service. To this, I add: Let us not forget to fulfill our obligations to our veterans and their survivors whose pensions must be fully paid pursuant to existing laws.\r\nOur country\u2019s opening to the global economy and the uncertainties raised by big-power configurations emerging in our region and in other regions\u2014all these have made necessary a broadening of our contacts and friendships in the world. The strength of our external security depends, above all else, upon good relations with our immediate neighbors. This is why we have placed the highest priority on reinforcing our relationships with our ASEAN partners; with Japan, with China, and all others with whom we share common borders. We have urgently brought the issue of the Spratlys to the world\u2019s attention\u2014at the councils of ASEAN; the Non-Aligned Movement; the ASEAN Regional Forum; and the ASEAN-China dialogue\u2014and are now able to sit down comfortably with China at the highest as well as working levels to ensure that conflicting claims in the South China Sea do not anymore disrupt the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. And we are taking active part in the endeavor to build one Southeast Asia. All the 10 countries of this dynamic community are now either members\u2014or observers\u2014in ASEAN. All have acceded to the Bali Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Last December we, their leaders, signed a treaty to keep Southeast Asia free of nuclear weapons. We shall be submitting this treaty to the Senate for its concurrence. Philippine-United States relations must continue to be anchored on our long-range policy of \u201ctrade, not aid\u201d for mutual benefit and on our mutual defense treaty.\r\nOver the foreseeable future, we see East Asia\u2019s security interests as best served by a security balance among the great powers, and by their increasing economic interdependence. This is one more reason we are pushing for liberalization of the trading system through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Beyond trade and investment, APEC is also about cooperation to develop our human resources, strengthen our small and medium enterprises, and share technology and knowledge, among others\u2014all these leading to a regional community anchored on mutual benefit and mutual respect. The 1996 APEC leaders\u2019 meeting in our country this November will have great significance for our people\u2014in terms of new jobs, higher incomes, and opportunities for technology transfer and market access in an interdependent Asia-Pacific.\r\nIn this government\u2019s search for peace, we have made a solid breakthrough. Within two years, I am confident we shall leave our country and people a legacy of better social cohesion and political unity\u2014on which future governments can build greater national capacity, stability, and prosperity for all Filipinos. Erstwhile military rebels have been reintegrated into civil society\u2014even as the process of dealing with their grievances continues. Many of the reforms they suggest\u2014in our electoral practices, for example\u2014have been incorporated into our proposals to Congress. I therefore ask you, the ladies and gentlemen of Congress, for your concurrence to the pending proclamations granting amnesty to members and supporters of RAM-SFP-YOU as part of our General Peace Agreement of October 1995, and reopening the application period for all categories of rebels. With the dissident National Democratic Front [NDF], our peace talks have finally moved on to substantive issues. But we are no more than cautiously optimistic, because of the ideological issues involved and the hard-line positions the NDF has taken. Fortunately, that 60-year-old conflict has substantially declined in its intensity, partly because our amnesty program has enabled individual rebels to return to the ways of peace.\r\nThe Davao City consensus of last month with the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF], which envisions our 14 Southern Provinces and the cities therein being brought into a special Zone of Peace and Development [ZOPAD], with a Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development [SPCPD] to promote it, moves us closer towards the resolution of the conflict that has cost more than 120,000 Filipino lives, with so many more dislocated from their homes these past 27 years. I credit the patient diplomacy of our government panel chaired by Ambassador Manuel Yan, the new statesmanship of MNLF chairman Nur Misuari, and the consistent support of the Organization of the Islamic Conference [OIC] and our partners in ASEAN, notably Indonesia, for this accomplishment. From hereon, with our vision for a peaceful and progressive Mindanao clear in our hearts and in our minds, let us manifest together, my beloved countrymen and countrywomen, in all communities in the southern Philippines, and at the level of the national leadership, that same spirit of accommodation and mutual benefit displayed by the negotiating parties. Let me underline briefly the points that are being misconstrued in the rush to judgment on the Davao consensus:\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Congress: Peace is a process and it must be carefully nurtured. So is development. Peace and development always go together. Together, both are our best weapons to alleviate poverty in Mindanao and everywhere else, because the lack of either one breeds deprivation and foments tension and armed conflict. Mindanao\u2014as well as the rest of the Philippines\u2014needs peace if it is to achieve the sustained, broad-based development its people deserve. Of the various proposals associated with our southern Philippines peace process, the most vital is ZOPAD, not SPCPD, because that is where all\u2014especially Congress\u2014can take part to make maximum use of a three-year period of respite and collaboration leading to sustainable development. Many voices\u2014pro and con\u2014from Congress, sectoral leaders, media, and from the affected communities themselves have been heard about our peace process, and I have taken counsel of them. But the decision to go forward rests on me as your President. To paraphrase an American President,\r\nNow there are many, many people who can recommend and advise, and a few of them consent. But there is only one who has been chosen by the people to decide.\r\nNow, I ask all of you for your support\u00a0to give our government and our people in our southern regions\u2014Christians, Muslims, Lumads, Filipinos all\u2014the MNLF, our soldiers, our policemen, and the people of our divided communities included\u2014this long-sought opportunity under our transitory arrangements to convert swords into plowshares. From every part of the globe, we do not lack examples of the futility of armed conflict as a way of settling ethnic, religious, economic, social, and cultural differences.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress: On this issue of bringing peace and making development happen in the Philippine south, I will continually ask you for your confidence and steady support. our quest for peace and development in Mindanao is more than a journey of a \u201cthousand miles\r\n\u201d as the Chinese proverb says. Our forebears had made the first steps. And we, at this time, are now near the end of this long journey. I invite you now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, to join me in taking the last step. As your President, I enjoin everyone to exorcise the ghosts of history. Let us cast aside our fears and our hurts. Let us give peace and development a chance in the southern Philippines.\r\nResolution of our homegrown conflicts will free us to focus on sharpening our competitiveness in the Asia-Pacific and world markets, as well as in the delivery of social services to our people. Competitiveness goes beyond GDP and other macroeconomic measures. It encompasses the entire spectrum of the political, social, cultural, scientific, and value systems of a country. And the lesson from East Asia is clear. Competitiveness comes from an open economy, from a stable political system, and from a united, hardworking people. Competitiveness comes from modern infrastructure, and from workpeople trained in cutting-edge technology.\r\nThe 1995 World Competitiveness Report praises the extreme openness of our national culture: the availability of competent senior managers and skilled workers, the way we have internationalized the Philippine economy, and the way our exports have grown, in both goods and services. But it identifies our country\u2019s biggest liabilities as the inadequacy of its infrastructure, its still-primitive transport systems, and the inefficiency of its distribution of goods and services. These, despite the gigantic strides we had made in the last four years in building roads, bridges, airports, seaports, power plants, and other public facilities. The report also warns how dangerously our human development lags behind those of our competitors\u2014our lack of physicians, the continuing drain of our skilled workers, and the high pupil-teacher ratio in our public school system. In addition to this, we must worry about our severe lack of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Thus, we must work on the things that will make us competitive in the world. We must become more efficient in our social processes and in our educational institutions. We must continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure, but this time not merely depending on purely government expenditures but on wider private sector participation. We must make not just our business enterprises\u00a0but the whole of national society competitive in the world by expanding research and development [R&D] in the emerging technologies and in education, especially in science and technology at all levels. We must raise the productivity of our farms, our factories, our small and medium enterprises, our workers, and our managers\u2014for we are now just recovering from the inefficiencies that marked our economy in past decades. In this regard, we shall soon be completing a national action agenda on productivity which I have instructed the National Economic Development Authority [NEDA] to coordinate, bringing together efforts of all sectors who are involved.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress\u2014I urge you to act now on economic measures I commended to this legislature last July 1995\u2014one SONA ago. To complete our liberalization of the economy, let us repeal the remaining laws\u2014some enacted over 40 years ago\u2014that still limit economic growth and deny the Filipino consumers access to quality goods at lower prices. Development, indeed, exacts a price that must be paid by those who want it.\r\nThis is why I regard as urgent and crucial Congressional action on our Comprehensive Tax Reform Package [CTRP]. The CTRP is the cornerstone of our government\u2019s effort to put the Filipino house in order and to gear up our economy for the coming era of free trade. Beyond these, tax reform is also the key component in our effort to compel the irresponsible rich to take up their rightful share of the civic burden. Right now, it is our salaried employees and the middle class who bear the bulk of the tax load. We must simplify our tax system\u2014broaden its base, lower its rates\u2014making it economically efficient and socially equitable; and remove from it areas of discretion that all too often lead to evasion and corruption. Our other urgent need is to generate more internal savings. Our savings rate of 19% of GNP is still well below the East Asian average of 30%. Our landmark reforms in the banking sector are designed to increase the mobilization of domestic savings, but our social insurance schemes need to be restructured and their applications to health, housing, education, and counterparting broadened. This is why I have ordered an in-depth study of a National Provident Fund System\u2014possibly consolidating the Social Security System [SSS], the Government Service Insurance System [GSIS], and others into one, and moving the entire combination towards private enterprise. Privatization will allow an enlarged provident fund system to widen its coverage, increase management flexibility in investing its portfolio, increase statutory minimum contributions, and decentralize its operations. Privatization and the spread of share ownership to ordinary Filipinos are at the heart of our thrusts for economic progress and social equity\u2014by the democratization of wealth and opportunity. We are determined to shed the state\u2019s discretionary economic interventions so that government can concentrate on its proper function\u2014which is to provide the framework of law, civic order and infrastructure within which private enterprise can flourish.\r\nThe same World Competitiveness Report also notes the need for streamlining the bureaucracy and for reforms in our justice system. To accelerate such reforms, we need above all to improve dramatically the effectiveness of public institutions. We must simplify the system of regulations, licenses, and permits accumulated over generations of big government that have often become opportunities for corruption. The entire public sector we must transform from a regulatory into a promotional and developmental paradigm serving and urging the private sector to become globally competitive\u2014similar to those that led to East Asia\u2019s amazing transformation these past 30 years. Most crucial of all, we must pursue our earlier efforts towards a more disciplined, cohesive, and convergent bureaucracy, and make our civil service an effective instrument of the modern state. We must improve government services to the people by cutting bureaucratic red tape. A professional bureaucracy requires government to compete with the private sector for talented people. Although we have increased the salaries of civil servants below undersecretary level by an average of 40% since 1992, even now our levels of pay cannot approximate those paid by business and the professions. Improving the desired efficiency of public agencies and especially their effectiveness will not be cheap\u2014but it will be public money well-spent.\r\nThat same 1995 World Competitiveness Report dealt also with the slow disposition of cases, which is most conspicuous in criminal proceedings. This has contributed greatly to popular frustration and marked erosion of people\u2019s faith in the administration of justice. The strengthening of the barangay justice system and the designation by the Supreme Court of 56 special criminal courts required to conduct daily trials are giant steps forward. That this improved procedure can work, we see in the Ongpin kidnapping case, the trial of which took only 20 days. We need many more reforms\u2014not only in speeding up procedures. We also need to increase the number of metropolitan trial courts and prosecutors. We should also upgrade the salaries of lower-court judges and those of the prosecution service to make their pay commensurate with their workload.\r\nFinally, we shall need to continue reforms in our political system\u00a0so that it can keep pace with our economic modernization. Generally, we need to keep down the violence, the vote-buying, and the cheating that still characterize our electoral process. Several other proposals for electoral reform which I support and are still pending include bills which would prohibit political dynasties and which would authorize absentee voting. We should also shorten reglamentary periods for our tribunals that decide electoral protests.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of this Tenth Congress: Again, I call upon you to pass the bills in support of our five priority programs, namely: greater political stability and national unity; economic and social development; energy development and infrastructure modernization; protection of the environment and natural resources; and energizing the bureaucracy. I am submitting to Congress the complete list of our priority legislative measures.\r\nOur problems are far from solved. But we have definitely made headway in dealing with them. Even more important, we have proved to ourselves that our difficulties do not arise from some deep-rooted cultural flaw. They have arisen from policy mistakes against which we have exerted collective effort and political will to set them aright\u2014today. Our heroic generation of 1896 animated our people\u2019s ideals and aspirations. Surely, we, who are today\u2019s leaders, can move our national community closer to the ideals of democracy, freedom and fraternity\u2014of which our national heroes dreamt. Surely we can organize for ourselves a society where ordinary people need not depend on any patron\u2019s charity, where they need not defer to anyone\u2019s superior status, where they can realize the possibilities of their lives in a peaceful and progressive national community.\r\nThe 19th-century French scholar Ernest Renan defined a nation as\r\n[a] community with a common memory\u2014a people that has suffered together.\r\nWe are such a community. Before the political persecutions of 1872, there was no Filipino nation. We were merely a collection of\r\n, creoles, and\r\nand the archipelago we inhabited was merely the name of a place. But after the execution of the martyr-priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora in February of that year, no further repression could prevent one Filipino nation\u2014in Rizal\u2019s words, ang Sambayanang Pilipino\u2014from being born.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: Today our country calls us, not to die but to live for it. The patriotism borne of revolution and war must give way to citizenship for peace and development, which means personal commitment, social obligation, civic responsibility. If each of us pulled his or her weight, then we as a nation can be bound together not only by the common memory of our past sufferings but by the progress we can enjoy together. As leaders of our country and as its loyal sons and daughters, such is the pledge we must renew on this the 100th year of the Philippine revolution of 1896 and of Rizal\u2019s martyrdom. In the solemnity of this chamber\u2014keenly aware of the tasks laid upon our hands by our people and by our fundamental charter\u2014let us seize this chance to give flesh and realization to our national beliefs and aspirations. On this the dawning of our centennial of Philippine independence, if there is one paramount achievement to which we Filipinos must dedicate ourselves, it is this\u2014that by 1998, we Filipinos must show and prove to the world that we are finally a nation united.\r\nSa madaling salita: Sa taong sanlibo siyam na raan at siyamnapu\u2019t walo (1998), taas-noo ang Pilipino na haharap sa buong mundo!\r\nSo, in this work we are to begin anew today, let us ask for God\u2019s guidance and support\u2014so we can win the new challenges of peace and development.\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas!", "title": "Uniting for Peace and Development"},

Aquino", "text": "VIDEO:\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4KelFPp7CQ[/youtube]\r\nTRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 22, 1991]\r\nSenate President Jovito Salonga; Speaker Ramon Mitra; Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan; Honorable Diosdado Macapagal; distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; fellow workers in government; honored guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nIn March 1973, six months after the declaration of martial law, Ninoy Aquino was taken blindfolded from Fort Bonifacio and brought to a place he did not know. He was stripped naked and thrown into a cell. His only human contact was a jailer. The immediate prospect, in such a place, was a midnight execution in front of a grave dug by himself.\r\nThe purpose was as clear as it was diabolical. It was not to kill him yet, but to break him first \u2013 and with him break the compelling proof that men can stand up to a dictatorship.\r\nHe came close to giving up, he told me; he slipped in and out of despair. But a power that must have been God held him together. He remembered the words of the epistle, God chose the weak to confound the strong.\r\nOn the third anniversary of his incarceration in Laur, the recol\u00adlection of his pain gave birth to a poem of hope. This is the poem he wrote:\r\nI am burning the candle of my\r\nlife in the dark\r\nwith no one to benefit\r\nfrom the light.\r\nThe candle slowly melts away;\r\nsoon its wick will be burned\r\nout\r\nand the light is gone.\r\nIf someone will only gather\r\nthe melted wax, re-shape it,\r\ngive it a new wick\u2014\r\nfor another fleeting moment\r\nmy candle can once again\r\nlight the dark,\r\nbe of service\r\none more time,\r\nand then \u2026 goodbye.\r\nThis is the anguish of good men: that the good they do will come to nothing. That pains suffered in obscurity or sacrifices made away from the sight of men, amount to the same, and mock the man or woman who bears them.\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, distinguished guests, my countrymen:\r\nThat is not true. None of the good that we do is ever lost; not even the light in an empty room is wasted.\r\nFrom Ninoy\u2019s burnt-out candle, and thousands like it in cells throughout the garrison state, we gathered the melted wax and made more candles. To burn\u2014not as long in such loneliness\u2014but much more brightly all together, as to banish the darkness, and light us to a new day.\r\nYou might ask, \u201cWhen will the president stop invoking Ninoy\u2019s name?\u201d My answer is, \u201cWhen a president stands here other than by Ninoy\u2019s grace. And not while gratitude is nourished by memory. Not while we acknowledge that it was his sacrifice that gave us back our freedom. And restored the freely elected office whose incumbent must stand every year in this place.\u201d\r\nFive years have passed. My term is ending. And so is yours. As we came, so should we go. With grateful acknowledgement to the man who made it possible for us to be here. A man who discovered hope in the starkest despair, and has something yet to teach a country facing adversity again.\r\nIt would be foolish to ignore what is staring us in the face. Our march of progress brought us far, but such misfortunes have come upon us as to make us feel that we are not much farther from where we started.\r\nThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo is the biggest in this century. Abroad, its effect is so far-reaching as to lower the temperature of the Earth. At home, it is so devastating it knocked off 80,000 productive hectares from our agriculture, and destroyed the commerce of at least three provinces. Hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes and livelihoods, and thrown on the kindness of relatives and countrymen, and on the solicitude of the state. It was an event so powerful it wiped out the largest military base in the Pacific, and changed the nature of our relationship with an old ally. In the wake of the volcanic eruption, more has been revealed about that relationship than was covered by its ash.\r\nBefore Pinatubo, there was the typhoon that cut a wide swathe of destruction across the southern regions. And before that was the killer quake that cut off the northern parts of the country, destroying billions of pesos in infrastructure, causing the loss of billions more in foregone economic activities. It leveled the City of Pines and buried children in the rubble of yet another city.\r\nBut those natural calamities were preceded by another entirely the work of human hands: the massive December 1989 military revolt that cut short a second economic recovery, after the dislocation caused by the earlier August 1987 coup attempt. That one strangled the powerful rebound of the Philippine economy after the EDSA Revolution.\r\nI mention these calamities not to excuse the perceived shortcomings of my administration nor to brag about my indestructibility. I mention them so that we know where we are, and why we are here, and the exact requirements of the task to build up this country yet again.\r\nI mention them because I will compare them with what we had and lost, and then I will ask, \u201cWas it all in vain?\u201d And I will answer, \u201cIt was not; no more than a hero\u2019s life is wasted.\u201d\r\nBy 1985, the economy had contracted considerably, its rate of growth has been negative for two consecutive years. The country was at a standstill, as if waiting only for the last rites to be performed. By 1986, we had turned the economy around\u2014in less than a year. We improved on that performance the year after.\r\nThe rate of unemployment was reduced, the volume of new investments significantly increased. New industrial projects were introduced, hitherto idle industrial capacity was fully utilized. The foundation of new regional industrial zones was laid. Public infrastruc\u00adture and services strained under the load of expanding economic activity.\r\nI mention this, not to offset the shortcomings of the present with the achievements of the past. I mention it to show what can be done in such a short time, and how much improvement was made from condi\u00adtions far worse than what we have today\u2014the dictator\u2019s apologists notwithstanding, that the country is worse off now than when he and his wife were stealing the country blind.\r\nThis progress was cut off by the August \u201987 coup attempt. But the economy quickly rallied, and in two years recovered a great deal of the ground we had lost. We were on the verge of a second takeoff when the December 1989 coup broke out. It drained the last drop of confidence in our future from all but the hardiest spirits, and shat\u00adtered our image abroad.\r\nStill we persevered, achieving gains that, admittedly, continue to fall short of the galloping needs of a fast-growing population, but real gains nonetheless.\r\nImproved health care, increased housing, and\u2014one of the proudest achievements we share with the legislature\u2014free secondary education: 660,000 youth immediately availed themselves of it; another 200,000 private school students received scholarship grants under another recent law; 80,000 new classrooms have been built\u2014the first preparation of the nation for the future of economic competition, which will take place in the highly educated minds of the youth.\r\nWe have made the first serious effort to arrest environmental degradation\u2014already so far advanced in the previous regime that it set up an agency that did nothing about it, anyway. We have pushed agrarian reform beyond the point of no return, almost completing its coverage of rice and corn. Its extension to other agricultural activities is proceeding at a pace consistent with our resolve to achieve for the farmer the prosperity promised by agrarian reform, and not just its bare legal implementation.\r\nIndeed, we started to make up our losses, and kept on going through the Gulf crisis which doubled the price of energy and introduced the element of a tremendous uncertainty, not only about our economy, but that of the world as well.\r\nYou might ask, \u201cHaving lost so much so easily, what was the worth of all that effort?\u201d\r\nWith such reversals of fortune, is progress for our country a hope in vain?\r\nPaul says that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance character; and character hope. The good we do is never lost. Some of it remains, if not in material goods, then in a deeper experience, a more practiced hand, and a spirit made stronger by that which failed to break it\u2014stronger to meet greater challenges ahead.\r\nBut in one thing we grew from strength to strength\u2014in the enlargement of our democratic space and the strengthening of our democracy.\r\nEvery calamity tested the capacity of democracy to absorb distress, find relief, and meet the absolute necessities of the people without the least curtailment of freedom or compromise of rights.\r\nAgainst our economic gains that are ever hostages to fortune, stands one steadfast, unalloyed achievement: our democracy. Destined, I believe, to outlive our problems and deck with the graces of liberty the material progress of our future. That achievement is better seen from the disinterested distance of foreign admirers, than from the myopic view of those at home who wish to destroy it. [\r\n] It is an achievement entirely in our power to preserve and enhance.\r\nVisitors from the new Germany asked me what things strengthen democracy. Economic progress, naturally, I said. But the attainment of that depends on external factors more than on the will of a developing country. But there is a way to strengthen democracy that is within any country\u2019s reach. That is through the empowerment of the people. This is obvious to a government like ours that came to power by its means, as well as to a people like the Germans who attained complete freedom in the same way.\r\nBut empowering the people means more than just giving them elections every three years. It means enlarging their contact with government beyond elections to its daily workings\u2014so that the vast resources of one support the initiatives of the other, and the policies of government are refined by the insights of the people. Ngunit ang pagkaloob ng kapangyarihan sa mamamayan ay nanganga\u00adhulugan hindi lamang ng pagdaraos ng halalan tuwing ikatlong taon. Kailangan pagyamanin ang kanilang pagkakadiit sa pamahalaan\u2014sa araw-araw na gawain ng pamahalaan\u2014upang ang malawak na kayamanan ng isa ay makatulong sa mga pagkukusa ng kabila at ang mga patakaran ng pamahalaan ay paglinangin ng mga mamamayan. By this means the lives of the people shall be con\u00adstantly improved and the people themselves empowered by the habit of directing their own government. The constant revision of flawed policies and the wider application of good ones are possible only by bringing together the people and the government. People empowerment, through people\u2019s organizations, NGOs, foundations, and cooperatives, is the surest means we know to make government mirror the aspirations of the people. [\r\n]\r\nIn the past, the idea was to give the people just enough power to elect their mistakes and suffer the consequences until the next elections. Elections were a safety valve. We want elections to be just one of other more effective means to bring the people into government and government to the people, to make it truly a participatory democracy.\r\nThis is the only way to end the character of total war that elections have assumed, where the aim is the division of spoils and the victims are not just the losers but those who voted for them too. Such elections are like Russian roulette where your chances are five to one your life will not improve, and one to five you will blow out your brains.\r\nParticipatory democracy will end the practice of punishing provinces and municipalities for the wrong vote in the last poll. It will separate elections, where the people vote for their favorites, from the provision of public service which every Filipino has a right to expect from the government, regardless how he voted.\r\nThis administration has made large steps in that direction. To the disappointment of those who marched with me against the Marcos regime, my administration has plowed resources into regions and provinces where I was cheated in the snap elections. The politics of revenge had had its day. [\r\n]\r\nThe organized participation of the people in daily government may provide the stabilizing element that government has always lacked. Policies have radically changed with each administration, yet the basic needs of its unchanging constituencies have not been met: less bureaucracy for business, more public services and infrastructure support for agriculture and industry, and economic safety net for the common man. The active participation of the people in government will lend proper direction and continuity to policy.\r\nThis is what I wish for most. That after me, the continuity of our work is not broken. So that things well done shall be completed, and the same mistakes avoided by succeeding administrations. In this way, nothing done shall go to waste, and the light of a misplaced candle shall still be valued for the light it sheds on the things to avoid.\r\nI am not asking that all my programs be blindly followed by my successor. God knows, we have made mistakes. But surely, our objective is right\u2014the improvement of our people\u2019s lives. And the new way is much better than those before. To give the people greater power over their lives is the essence of democracy that we must strive to bring out completely.\r\nThese ideas, articulated in the Kabisig movement, may not have been well received by this body. It was wrongly projected. I should make it clear that the Kabisig, and the whole movement of people\u2019s organizations that I have tried to encourage, will be campaigning hard for one candidate only\u2014the Filipino people and no one else. [\r\n]\r\nGive the people power movement another chance, for it will go on regardless. I ask you to consider that we have tried the politics of spoils and patronage for half a century, with no better result than the stagnation of the country in a region where everyone else is racing ahead.\r\nThe formula for success is said to be dictatorial government.\r\nBut we tried that already, with worse results than the most irresponsible democracy can produce. Besides, the spirit of our race will not accept a dictatorship; and memories, fresh as the scars it left, will not let us consider that option again. Democracy is the only way for us. We must therefore find the ways by which the pitfalls that go with its blessings are reduced, while its inherent strengths are brought to the fore. Of those strengths, the most promising is people power, a reserve for nation-building we tapped only once in our history with such marvelous result.\r\nA detailed report of the performance of government is before you; the legislative agenda\u2014principally the Local Government Code, the Civil Service Code, revenue enhancement measures, and electoral reforms\u2014has been communicated to the Senate President and to the Speaker of the House.\r\nThis is the last time I shall address you on such an occasion as this. Let us clear the air between us.\r\nI could have made things easier for myself if I had opted for the \u201cpopular.\u201d\r\nI could have repudiated the foreign debt, won the passing praise of a greatly relieved people, and the lasting contempt of a devastated country.\r\nI could have opted for outright hostility towards the international banking system and invited its retaliation. But the only result would have been to weaken the present democracy against the conspiracies of the former government which contracted the miserable debt in the first place. I would have taken the chance, if I were the only one at risk, but I had a country to take care of. [\r\n]\r\nI could have called for an elected constitutional convention.\r\nSurveys showed that an elected convention was the popular choice to draft a new constitution. But I believed it was more important to draft a constitution and submit it for ratification in the shortest time possible, and hold elections immediately. The people and the army needed a full elected government and a constitution around which to rally in defense of freedom.\r\nI could not afford the luxury of the popular by waiting out the endless deliberations of an elected convention, like the 1971 Constitutional Convention. And besides, what was so great about that experience? After a year of talk and scandal, the final draft was prepared in Malaca\u00f1ang, approved by the frightened convention, and ratified in a fraudulent plebiscite.\r\nI could have made things easier for myself if I had allowed the executive to influence the decisions of constitutional commissions. I might have spared myself deep embarrassments by interfering with the judgments of the courts. But I uphold the independence of these bodies. I am convinced it is in all our best interest to respect an independence that may thwart the government\u2019s will from time to time\u2014but is yet our best assurance of justice when we will need justice most. [\r\n]\r\nI firmly believe in the freedom of the press. And I accept the criticisms poured on me, painful as they are, as part and parcel of the hazards of public service, and conducive to its honest performance. True, I have sued for libel, but I did not use the power of the presidency to advance my cause. And this is shown by the fact that four years later my case continues to drag on. [\r\n] I have not forgotten that what my husband wanted most in prison was for the public to hear the side of freedom, and no newspaper would print it.\r\nI submitted myself to the judicial process as an ordinary citizen, and exposed myself to indignities a president should not endure. But I want to encourage people to seek redress in the law, despite the inconvenience, rather than in vindictiveness, which has no end. I want them to make the cause of justice for one, the cause of justice for all. [\r\n]\r\nI have consoled myself that great men like Gandhi were not spared criticism either, but\u2014regardless of it\u2014he pursued the path he believed was true, mindful only of harmful effects on the people, but not of the consequences to him. He believed that God demands no less of us than that we follow our conscience. God will take care of the rest.\r\nI could have done the popular thing in the last admi\u00adnistration, and arranged a nicer retirement for myself. But my instructions to PNB, DBP, GSIS, SSS, and Land Bank were explicit: no behest loans, and no special favors [\r\n] whether to relative, friend, or political supporter. This accounts for their sterling performance, for the unprecedented public faith in their competence and integrity, and for the incalculable contribution, particularly of PNB and the Land Bank, to the development of cooperatives and the financing of small and medium enterprises, wherein lies the strongest hope of progress in these times.\r\nWe can roll back prices at the drop of a hat and spare ourselves all the aggravation, but we learned that hasty rollbacks exacted a heavier, long-term cost on the economy, and, ultimately, on the people, than they had saved.\r\nI could have done any of the things calculated to win a passing popularity at home. I could have thrown away by so-called popular solutions the goodwill we have built up in financial circles by the strict performance of our obligations. This is the goodwill that accounts for the continued support extended to the Philippine Assistance Program [PAP]. Anyway, most of the pledges to the PAP are redeemable in the next administration.\r\nI could have said, \u201cLet my successor be presented with the bill for my popularity today.\u201d But it is the people who would pay the price, and I am not made that way. [\r\n]\r\nI did not always adopt the ideal solutions proposed by those who have the luxury of contemplation. Government often had to do what pressing realities compelled it. And if the government sometimes lacked better choices, it never lacked the sincere desire to do good. [\r\n]\r\nI could have promoted only military officers popular with the press, and ignored the experience of a democratic government that has been the principal military objective of the rebel forces and an insurgency that just doesn\u2019t know when to quit. But I chose instead commanders of proven courage, leadership, and fidelity to the Constitution.\r\nI could do the smart thing still, and do the things my opponents unfairly charge me of preparing\u2014rigging the elections in 1992, the way I did not rig the ratification of the Constitution, the national elections, and the local elections. The way they rigged elections from 1969 to 1986. But my instructions to the military and police are explicit. Let them hear it again:\r\nThe right of the soldier and the policeman is merely to cast his vote; his greater and solemn obligation is to assure the right of others to cast their votes and get them honestly counted. [\r\n] No soldier has the right to combine with his comrades to campaign for a person or party and deliver to them a block of the military vote. No member of the military shall lend his name, prestige, and the influence of his position to anyone\u2019s campaign. The same holds true for the police. [\r\n]\r\nThe military has earned the people\u2019s trust as the spearhead of their liberation and the constant defender of their democracy. To these honors, it is my aim to add the distinction of shepherding our democracy through its first political succession, by clean and peaceful elections. [\r\n]\r\nI will not preside as Commander in Chief over the kind of military that cheated the opposition in 1978, and me in 1986. [\r\n] That would insult the memory of the man to whom I dedicate this last address to the joint houses of Congress, and stain the proud achievement of this nation in 1986.\r\nI specifically charge AFP Chief of Staff General Lisandro Abadia and PNP Director General Cesar Nazareno with the responsibility to assure clean and honest elections. [\r\n] While they may not fear my displeasure because I will not be president then, they will face the judgment of the disappointed country.\r\nYes, I could have done all those things that win wide acclaim, exiting as grandly as any president could wish. But while my power as president ends in 1992, my responsibility as a Filipino for the well-being of my country goes beyond it to my grave. [\r\n] A great part of that responsibility is to do the best I can today, according to my best lights, while I have the power to do it.\r\nAs President, I have never prayed for anything for myself; only for our people. I have been called an international beggar by the military rebels. Begging does not become me, yet\u2014\u00a0perhaps it is what I had to do. I could have kept my pride and held aloof, but that would not have helped our people. And it is for them that I was placed in this office. [\r\n]\r\nSomeone who will do better may stand in this place next year, for I believe in the inexhaustible giftedness of the Filipino people. I only hope that he will be someone who will sincerely mean you well. [\r\n]\r\nI hope that history will judge me as favorably as our people still regard me, because, as God is my witness, I honestly did the best I could. No more can be asked of any man. [\r\n]\r\nOn June 30, 1992, the traditional ceremony of political succession will unfold at the Luneta. The last time it was done that way was in 1965. I shall be there with you to proudly witness the event. This is the glory of democracy, that its most solemn moment should be the peaceful transfer of power. [\r\n]\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat at paalam. [\r\n] [\r\n]", "title": "The State of the Nation"},

Aquino", "text": "VIDEO:\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRE2afFJaAY[/youtube]\r\nTRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 1990]\r\nSenate President Jovito Salonga; Speaker Ramon Mitra; distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan and associate justices of the Supreme Court; members of the Cabinet; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nWe gather today at a most crucial time in our history.\r\nSeven days ago, a large portion of our country was rocked by one of the most serious natural calamities we have ever expe\u00adrienced: an earthquake which registered at magnitude 7.7 in the open-\u00adended Richter scale, and intensity 8 in the Rossi-Forel scale near the epicenter. The tremor struck at 4:26 in the afternoon. After 45 seconds, 9 of our cities and 39 municipalities in 15 provinces lay damaged; some, almost totally devastated.\r\nAs of this morning, based on the NDCC reports, we have accounted for 899 fatalities, most of them from the cities of Baguio and Cabanatuan. We have counted 3,061 injured with Dagupan City suffering the worst\u2014actual property damage recorded so far is P2.6 billion. But we estimate the total damage to properties to reach from 10 to 15 billion pesos.\r\nI personally visited Cabanatuan, Baguio, and Dagupan, sites of the heaviest damage to lives and property. There I saw and experienced for myself the grief that death and loss summon from our hearts.\r\nBut it was not sorrow alone that was present in those disaster sites.\r\nAmid the debris, I saw the strength and courage; I witnessed the selfless\u00adness and heroism of our people. In the midst of devastation, there is the will to survive; to help others; to rebuild; to start anew.\r\nBy the grace of God and the unshakeable faith of the Filipino people, I am confident we will pull through.\r\nYes, once again, we face a crisis.\r\nBut you and I and the rest of our people are not strangers to this. Since time immemorial, natural and man-made calamities have visited our land\u2014bringing with them widespread death and destruction.\r\nAnd always, our people would rise from the rubble. We would shake off the dust and wipe the tears. And while we mourn our losses, our hope for the coming of a new day never dies.\r\nEarthquakes can destroy the strongest man-made structures; but they can never shatter the faith of the Filipino.\r\nTo this day, rescue and relief work goes on. But slowly and surely, our countrymen are gearing up for the next important task\u2014that of reha\u00adbilitation.\r\nOur people are determined to go back to their normal lives within the next few days. Our farmers want to return to their fields. Our labor force wants to return to their workplaces. Our businessmen want to resume the conduct of trade and commerce.\r\nToday they are no longer asking us for gestures of pity. They are asking for assistance\u2014to help them get back on their feet.\r\nI\r\ntherefore come before you today to ask you to work hand in hand with me in the effort to restore the normalcy of our people\u2019s lives.\r\nThere is, however, more that I would like to ask of you today. Let me ask you to look beyond rehabilitation and share with me instead the vision of the building of a much stronger nation.\r\nFor while this is a time for grieving, so is this a time to survey the opportunities arrayed before us\u2014the opportunity to grow further in our maturity as a people; to leave the mistakes of the past and build on our strength; to abandon the hatred and the division and to start afresh as a people tested by suffering, faced with the options for a better tomorrow.\r\nAt this point, we must ask; where shall we draw the needed fortitude to maximize these opportunities?\r\nFrom where I stand, I see four sources.\r\nFirst, our gains over the past four years.\r\nSecond, the strength and courage that our people have demonstrated during this calamity.\r\nThird, the avenues for partnership among people and government that we have established.\r\nAnd fourth, our abiding faith in God who has always cared for us.\r\nMay I invite you to examine our gains.\r\nLast year, our nation bustled with productive energy.\r\nThe 5.7 percent growth in our economy was well within target.\r\nA total of 17 billion 480 million pesos in foreign investments poured into our country, 75 percent more than the previous year, evidence of the continuing confidence of the international community in our economic recovery.\r\nWe reduced our foreign debt by 4.3%\u2014from $27,800,000 in 1988, down to $26,600,000 as of January of this year.\r\nOur stock exchanges registered a business volume of more than P22 billion, unmatched in the history of our country\u2019s stock market.\r\n1989 was definitely a banner year.\r\nSome 703,000 Filipinos gained access to new jobs as the unemploy\u00adment rate in our country went down to 9.2%, from the 9.6% registered in 1988.\r\nThe annual per capita income of our workers rose by 3.3% as we moved to ensure that no government worker would receive a salary lower than P2,000; and to increase the minimum wage in the private sector by P25 per day.\r\n91,349 more Filipino families were able to build homes last year, the fruit of a vigorous housing program with an unprecedented record. Last year\u2019s mark brought the total number of our beneficiaries from 1986 to 1989 to 193,735 families. This shows our ability to provide new homes for an average of 64,578 families every year, surpassing the record of 1975 to 1985, where an average of only 28,543 families were given shelter annually.\r\nOver 1 million schoolchildren, including those living in remote barangays, benefited from the 26,406 classrooms. constructed last year.\r\n2,503,794 high school students benefited last year from our free public secondary education program. In addition, 101,000 more young Filipinos were able to attend high school last year. These are the students who cannot be accommodated in our public high schools but whom we assisted through service contracts with private educational institutions.\r\nIn February 1986, the lowest paid teachers, or those in Teacher Level 1, were receiving only a measly basic salary of P1,096.00 plus allow\u00adances of P350.00.\r\nIn recognition of their crucial role in the upbringing of our youth, together we endeavored to raise this pay level. Today, our teachers in the lowest bracket are receiving a total of P3,102.00, plus additional compen\u00adsation paid from the local funds of the local government units where they serve.\r\nIn February 1986, the highest paid teachers, or those in the secondary Principal 4 level, were receiving only a total package of P2,393.00. Today, that has been raised to P7,478.00.\r\nSome 1,407more kilometers of major roads and 4,890 kilometers of feeder roads were constructed last year. This brings the total number of major roads built from 1986 to 1989 to 3,365 kilometers; and feeder roads to 18,120 kilometers.\r\n27,530 more hectares of farmlands were irrigated last year, benefi\u00adting 18,500 more farmers.\r\nNearly 7,000,000 more Filipinos gained access to safe drinking water with the implementation of 51,820 water supply projects.\r\nFrom 2,042 barangays all over the country, among them the remot\u00adest, 2,700,000 more Filipinos now enjoy power supply. Last year, we added 349 barangays to this number.\r\nIn all of our efforts to sustain the forces in our economy, we have emphasized the use of science and technology. At present, we are transferring technology from those who generate them to the end-users, especially in our rural areas.\r\nThus, we are supporting the widespread use of organic fertilizers in rice culture. This would save us some P241,000,000 yearly if used to replace half of present fertilizer imports. This type of fertilizer will increase farm income by as much as P3,000 per hectare every crop season.\r\nWe are also studying the potentials of locally developed technology using agro wastes, such as coconut husks, corn cobs, and coffee hulls, for brickmaking, grain drying, and power generation. This is called the gasifier-combustor. If one-fifth of these agro wastes replace the 4 million barrels of bunker fuel we now use for power generation, we could save about $70 million yearly.\r\nOur advances in these areas received further boost from our accomplishments in the peace and order scene.\r\nLast year, over 3,500 rebels, from both the communist and secessionist movements returned to the fold of the law. Another 2,500 surrendered during the first semester of this year.\r\nSixty-three ranking communist leaders were neutralized. Of this, 12 were top ranking national leaders of the CPP-NPA.\r\nWe have reduced the fighting strength of the CPP-NPA by 19% by the end of 1989. And we brought down the number of communist\u00ad-affected barangays by nearly 2,000, or 25% of the total number in 1988.\r\nWe registered last year a combat fatality ratio of one to two-and-a-half in favor of the government, the highest such favorable ratio in six years.\r\nInall parameters of our counterinsurgency effort, we are ahead. Also in the interest of peace and security, we continued to engage in diplomatic moves to formalize agreements and treaties protecting our interests. We undertook serious efforts to resolve territorial disputes. Our diplomatic missions have kept our lines open with the Organization of Islamic Conference countries. We have consistently used this access to apprise these countries of our accelerated implementation of autonomy for Muslim Mindanao.\r\nAnd as the century of Pax Pacifica beckons, we continue to strengthen our foreign relations through our commitments to pluralist democracy, responsible market policies, and development diplomacy\u2014all within the Constitutional provisions on national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, the right to self-determination, and the commitment to international peace.\r\nThese gains would have been meaningless without advances in the area of justice. Here, we directed our efforts over the past 12 months at further improving the investigation and prosecution processes, and at providing our less privileged countrymen with much better access to our justice system.\r\nWe initiated the prosecution of civilians who took part in the failed December coup, which cases are now pending in our courts. We also prosecuted and secured the conviction of the accused in such celebrated cases as the murder of Secretary Jaime Ferrer; the murder of NAMFREL volunteers in Quirino; the murder of Fr. Carl Schmitz; and the attempted large-scale smuggling of firearms.\r\nWe adopted measures to expedite preliminary investigation of cases by shortening the period for appeal and strictly imposing the period within which cases must be resolved. We have also weeded out corrupt and inefficient prosecutors .\r\nWe relentlessly pursued drug syndicates and gambling lords and busted their operations.\r\nWe gave 184,208 indigents free legal aid.\r\nAnd because of the need for suitable and dignified facilities for our judges and other officials in the justice system, we are constructing halls of justice in various parts of the country. Twenty-three of these will be ready for occupancy by the end of this month; 16 more will be completed by the end of the year.\r\nWe also advanced our quest for social justice as 340,000 more Filipino farmers were given ownership of the land they till, 85% more than the number in 1988.\r\nIn the process, we have distributed 13 times more land to former tenants under our Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program than was distributed from 1965 to 1985.\r\nWe also ensured that the lands they now own will become more productive through financial and technical support. Last year, we released P820,250,000 in production loans to farmer-beneficiaries.\r\nThis sum brings to P1,170,000 the total amount of production loans we have provided to 220,368 farmer-beneficiaries since I signed the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law passed by this Con\u00adgress in 1988.\r\nOur determination to implement our policy of decentralization found concrete expression when you and I began the process leading to the creation of two regional autonomous governments.\r\nThe first to undergo this process were provinces in southern Philip\u00adpines where most of our Muslim brethren live. This vesting of political autonomy underscores your firm resolve and mine to continue enhancing the lives of Muslim Filipinos through their more meaningful participation in our nation\u2019s political life.\r\nOn November 19 last year, our countrymen from this region cast their ballots, making their voice heard in the proposal to include their respective provinces in the proposed autonomous region. Sulu, Tawi\u00ad-Tawi, Lanao del Sur, and Maguindanao chose autonomy.\r\nIn this autonomous region, on February 17, 1990, over 600,000 voters went to the polling places once more; this time, to select from 126 candidates the occupants of 23 elective positions in the regional assembly. By the first week of this month, all the winners have been proclaimed, thus completing this chapter in their bid for regional autonomy.\r\nThe second to undergo this process was the Cordillera region. On January 30, 1990, the proposed Organic Act for the Autonomous Region of the Cordilleras was presented to the voters there. The province of Ifugao accepted membership in the autonomous region.\r\nPolitical and material progress are, however, not the sole measures of democracy\u2019s success. That is reckoned, as well, in the quality of a people\u2019s spirit\u2014in their attitude to the present and hope for the future.\r\nOver the past months, in my continuing visits to the countryside, including the remotest and poorest provinces, I listened to our people and examined their lives. Having watched them so closely, I am encouraged by their resiliency and determination. Spurred by the support given them by government, they have set out to fashion for themselves a new and bright future. They are relying on their resourcefulness and industry and on one another to improve their lives.\r\nLast year, I felt this resurgent spirit enkindled in the people of Bataan and Bohol, Cavite and Laguna. I saw this again among our countrymen in Negros Oriental, Zamboanga City, as well as Cotabato City.\r\nThis year, I saw this among the garments and livelihood cooperatives of Bulacan; and among the farmers of the people\u2019s livelihood foundations of Pangasinan and Tarlac.\r\nThis is evident too among the people\u2019s organizations of Catan\u00adduanes, Pampanga, Romblon, Negros Occidental, North and South Cota\u00adbato, Rizal, Iloilo, and Camarines Sur.\r\nIn many parts of our country, I saw a new determination among our people to work hand in hand with us, to link arms with us, in our effort to translate our democracy into a better life for our people.\r\nAs we, however, were making real headway in our socioeconomic thrusts, the enemies of our democracy, who comprised some 2% of the military, struck on December 1, 1989, in a futile bid to blunt the impact of the gains of our democracy.\r\nFor a few days, these misguided elements waged war against our people, employing a terrifying fear strategy that unmasked all their pretensions to ideological inclinations. Before our people, they attempted to display brute force, hoping to create an aura of armed victory. By December 6, the show was over. True to form, the leaders of the failed coup deserted their men once more to face the consequences of their act.\r\nOnce more, our people, and the 98% of our armed forces who remained loyal to our Constitution, thwarted the evil design of this band of military adventurists and their civilian supporters.\r\nOnce more, we proved that we are a resolute people. While we have yet to fully recover from the consequences of the imprudence of these misguided elements, our resolve to move forward has not been diminished. This failed adventurism has underscored the fact that our restored democracy has gone past its fledgling stage. It has proceeded to mature and is now ready for a more profound expression in our life as a nation.\r\nI am truly encouraged by what our people have proved themselves capable of. They have worked hard with us to give substance to the meaning of participatory democracy, not just in the political arena, but in the realm of our nation\u2019s social and economic life as well.\r\nAs President, I have deemed it fitting to enshrine in. a people\u2019s movement the transformation of democracy from concept to reality by our countrymen.\r\nHindi ako binigo ng ating mga kababayan. Sa pagtawag ko sa sambayanan upang magkapit-bisig, tumugon ang mga kababayan nating tahimik na nagpapatulo ng pawis upang bumuti ang buhay ng kanilang pamilya, kapwa, at komunidad.\r\nAng mga Kabisig nating ito ang nagbigay-buhay sa diwa ng EDSA.\r\nSa lahat ng dako ng ating bansa ay taglay pa rin nila ang diwa ng rebolusyon ng 1986. Patuloy silang kumikilos laban sa kahirapan, kagu\u00adluhan, sakit, at kamangmangan.\r\nKatulong natin sila sa pagpapabilis at pagpapalaganap ng ating mga programa: sa repormang pansakahan; sa kapayapaan at kaayusan; sa pangangalaga ng ating kalikasan at likas na yaman; sa pagpapatupad ng desentralisasyon; at sa paghango natin sa mga kapus-palad nating kababayan mula sa kahirapan. Kasama natin sila sa pagtulong sa mga biktima ng nagdaang lindol sa Cabanatuan, Dagupan, Baguio, at iba pang mga pook.\r\nBinigyang buhay ng mga Kabisig nating ito ang diwa ng ating Saligang Batas; binigyang halimbawa nila ang tunay na kahulugan ng demokrasya.\r\nThe magnitude of our people\u2019s involvement in the business of our nation today is without precedent in our history.\r\nAll these find expression in a national movement\u2014a movement that recognizes the silent, enduring crusade of our people; and, their call for participatory democracy.\r\nWe shall count on the strength of this partnership as we take the next steps in the building of a stronger nation.\r\nNow, the Filipino people must continue to lead the way.\r\nMany have benefited from the example of our previous struggles.\r\nMany more stand to profit from what we shall make out of our democracy and freedom. We have proven many things during the past four years.\r\nThere is still much that has to be done. Despite the limited time left, we have our gains of four years to build on.\r\nAnd from where I stand, I see that our nation is ready to take that giant step forward. Many of the needed reforms are in place. Our democracy is tried and tested. Our people are firm in their commitments.\r\nWe, in the elected leadership, must lead the way. We must demonstrate the willingness to pay the price, to accept the sacrifice that accompanies these decisions. Above all, we must show the supreme example of unity\u2014unity born out of our shared aspirations for the common good.\r\nMay I now invite you to examine the challenges involved in this important step forward.\r\nFirst, it is imperative that we take decisive steps to continue enhan\u00adcing our nation\u2019s productive capabilities.\r\nWe recognize the reality that the sufficiency of food on our tables is an important benchmark of the success of our democracy.\r\nWe took a crucial step when we launched our national rice action program early this year. Through this program, we expect to achieve a sustained annual growth rate in our production of at least 3% to 3.5% in rice, and at least 5% in corn.\r\nWe expect, however, that despite the massive resources and support we are giving our rice farmers, we will still experience a heavy toll on our harvest due to the prolonged dry season that we just experienced. Fortu\u00adnately, our earlier gains in the agricultural sector will cushion the effect of this drought.\r\nThe productivity of our industrial sector was increased because of the peace that now characterizes much of labor-management relationship. Our renascent democracy has helped our workers appreciate more deeply the value of the peaceful resolution of conflicts. The number of strikes and lockouts have significantly decreased. In the process, P1 billion in workers\u2019 salaries and benefits, and about P5.7 billion in production costs were saved.\r\nWe are supporting our drive for greater productivity with a stream\u00adlined but responsive infrastructure program that placed special emphasis on our countryside. Of the total 6,297 kilometers of roads we constructed last year, 95% were built in the provinces. We have also placed emphasis on infrastructures that would support livelihood in our rural areas. Much of the productivity of our countryside rests on our speedy implementation of our Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. The selflessness of a mature people could provide this program with the much\u00ad needed boost.\r\nWe also need to enhance productivity by more responsive programs on energy. We recognize the setbacks resulting from the power shortage we all experienced this year. While we have already instituted the remedies necessary to bring our power supply back to normal, we are determined to put in place the needed long-term power infrastructure that will assure our people a permanently stable supply of electricity.\r\nThese energy programs must be complemented by our efforts in the areas of telecommunications and transportation. The archipelagic nature of our geography calls for a safer, modern, and more efficient system of interisland water transportation.\r\nWe must remember that the highest priority in our quest for greater productivity are our disadvantaged countrymen. If we produce more, those who have less shall have more to partake of. This is the rationale for the many reforms we have implemented to tilt the balance in favor of the less privileged; to tilt the balance in favor of the countryside.\r\nOur efforts at increased production must be complemented by our reinvigorated drive for conservation. I believe an important expression of our maturity is our exercise of good stewardship over our resources.\r\nI am pleased to report that we marked a milestone last year in our reforestation program. In 1989, we reversed the deforestation trend: We have now planted more areas with trees than the areas wasted by the irresponsible exploitation of our forest resources.\r\nLinking arms with our people and with nongovernmental organiza\u00adtions, we have created a vision of development without destruction.\r\nTo underscore this commitment, I directed the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on June 1, 1990, to blast all roads leading to virgin forests being used by illegal loggers. Furthermore, we have drastically reduced the number of timber license agreements from 142 to 75.\r\nOur maturity must now also be reflected in our stance on the population issue. I am aware that this is an emotionally charged subject matter that some of us have opted to shelve, or even totally ignore in the past.\r\nWe must now face this responsibility squarely and address it as a crucial health issue\u2014a health issue where the well-being of our children, mothers, families\u2014in fact, of our whole society, is at stake.\r\nHere, we would like to give life to Article 15 of our Constitution which upholds the importance of our families, and the right of our children to proper care and nutrition.\r\nAt stake here, too, is the very application of the principles of our democracy: where our people make the choice; where the final judgment on the morality of their choices is left to the freedom of their conscience.\r\nThe magnitude of the rebuilding work that is before us calls for the involvement of many more hands. There is thus a need for greater involvement among our youth, especially in activities where they are given the opportunities to appreciate the value of hard work, love for country, and a mature sense of responsibility.\r\nIn calling for this, we uphold the provisions of our Constitution. For we thereby underscore our recognition of the youth\u2019s vital role in nation-\u00adbuilding.\r\nFor two years now, we have provided our youth with a vehicle for participation in public and civic affairs through the President\u2019s Summer Youth Program. Over 71,000 young people took hands-on jobs in the countryside, in private sector offices, and in our government agencies. We exposed them to the realities of life while encouraging them to keep their idealism and advocacy for reforms.\r\nAnd this month we called on them to march with us in our fight against drug abuse. They have responded well with the launching of the Junior Drug Watch.\r\nI hope that in the coming years, there will be even more participation by them in these activities.\r\nOur maturity is also anchored on a citizenry whose sense of patriot\u00adism is expressed in their honest and active participation in our revenue generation effort. This was evident last year as we increased our tax collection by 35.4%: from P90,400,000 in 1988 to P122,400,000 last year.\r\nThe more important expressions of our maturity, however, are the policy decisions we shall make as we adopt innovations in our revenue generation scheme: as we shift the tax burden from our poorer countrymen to the more affluent sectors of our society; as we enhance the equity and progressive character of our income tax measures; as we promote local autonomy through stronger local financing; as we continue to improve our tax administration.\r\nWe shall also undertake even more decisive steps towards lowering inflation and bringing down our fiscal deficits. In connection with this, we are intensifying our revenue generation efforts; we are accelerating the sale of government assets even as we take all the necessary measures to minimize public spending.\r\nWe will not stop until we bring down the public sector deficit to the more tolerable 3% as a ratio to our gross domestic product. We are determined to bring this ratio further down in the next two years.\r\nWe continue to strive to make compassion a genuine hallmark of our society. But as we take the path of maturity, we see the greater need to balance compassion with the strength of the arms of justice. Painful though it may be, we must look at the options for heavier penalties for plunder; for heinous crimes; for crimes against public order, including rebellion and attempts at seizing the powers of the State.\r\nOur maturity is anchored, too, on the commitment of our soldiers to our Constitutional democracy. While there are still a few within the AFP who continue to hang the sword of Damocles over our people, I am proud to say that, on the whole, the AFP continues to be the protector of our democratic gains. Even as they perform their mandate of keeping peace and order in our land, they are also our partners in our development goals.\r\nI cite in particular our AFP Engineering Corps, whose engineering brigades undertake the construction of several vital infrastructure, par\u00adticularly in the areas threatened by insurgency.\r\nI am pleased to note that even in our peace and order efforts, the partnership approach is applied. The civilian sector continues to play a vital role in our integrated strategy towards the attainment of these goals. This partnership is evident in our various interagency councils, such as the peace and order, the regional development, and the national reconciliation and development councils.\r\nOur maturity is anchored on our ability to earn and maintain a place of honor and respect in the community of nations.\r\nWe acknowledge the support of our friends in our economic deve\u00adlopment thrusts. Last year, we obtained pledges and grants totaling $3,500,000, 98% of which have already been programmed or utilized for specific projects.\r\nThis place of honor also rests on our credibility before our interna\u00adtional creditors. Today, we still suffer from the burdensome legacy of the past. Our foreign debt continues to stare us in the face; and so does the responsibility of servicing all of these debts.\r\nSince the time we inherited these liabilities, you and I have not stopped looking for better repayment terms from our creditors. We have also pushed back the terms for the repayment of the principal. Where opportunities are present, we have taken advantage of them so as to buy back debts at significant and favorable discounts.\r\nI share with you the concern that a significant amount of our country\u2019s foreign exchange receipts flows out to service our foreign debt. I share with you the strong desire to see the day when our precious foreign exchange shall be used instead to fund social development.\r\nIt is also my hope, however, that Congress would share with me the concern that any move we take on the manner of debt repayment must never jeopardize in any way our painfully built good standing with our creditors.\r\nThe systematic approach we have adopted over the past four years has been beneficial to our people, to our constituents. This approach has favored our economic growth; price stability; and our renewed access to the international financial market.\r\nOur economy today is one of the best performing among nations with substantial foreign debt. And this has been possible only because our creditors believe that they can count on our word and commitment. You and I must work together to keep it that way.\r\nFinally, we must address the issue of our relationship with the United States of America.\r\nWe are determined to chart a new course in our relationship with our long-time ally. I served the notice of termination of our military bases agreement. I have made sure that the provisions of our Constitution have been strictly adhered to. Above all, I have painstakingly endeavored to ensure that the national interest will be upheld whatever the outcome of our future discussions with the United States.\r\nI served that notice of termination knowing the far-reaching conse\u00adquences of that act. I declared our preparedness to look into other possibili\u00adties in our relationship with America. I underscored our desire to keep the friendship, whatever form our partnership may take in the future.\r\nIn this historic event, there is a paramount issue to address. This is the question of our ability as a people to live out to the fullest the true essence of sovereignty.\r\nWe must ensure that in making the decision as to whether the bases must go or stay, we must unite instead of divide.\r\nShould we become a nation divided after this decision, then there shall be no sovereignty to speak of. To follow our national will, whatever option we might take, we must first agree to rid ourselves of unhealthy division. Only then can we stand up to any foreign nation and say, \u201cThis is our people\u2019s decision; we shall pursue it by every means.\u201d\r\nWhen the two Houses of our Congress therefore meet in this Fourth Regular Session, there are two things I shall ask of you. First, I ask you to consider and appreciate the significance of this time in our history. I ask you to consider the options for a giant step forward that are arrayed before us.\r\nAnd second, I ask you to address a legislative agenda that will push our democracy further into that level of maturity\u2014a higher level of maturity necessary to the rebuilding of our nation. A good part of this agenda is drawn from initiatives already taken by the two Houses of Congress. In adopting this agenda, we focus on the commonality of our goals and our shared vision for our country and people.\r\nI recognize as well that most of the bills in this agenda have been passed by one of the two Chambers and accordingly transmitted to the other. It is my hope and urgent call that this agenda we have worked out together will be completely enacted during this Fourth Regular Session.\r\nMay I now propose the following:\r\nFirst, to help our countrymen in the disaster areas: the immediate passage of House Bill 31448 appropriating P10 billion for aid, relief, and rehabilitation, and for the repair and reconstruction of permanent structures affected by the recent earthquake.\r\nSecond, to further hasten our poverty alleviation and countryside agro-industrial development thrusts, the passage of the following mea\u00adsures:\r\n1. Providing small and medium enterprises with capital of less than P5,000,000 with an integrated assistance package and services, including more accessible credit and financing;\r\n2. Strengthening the social amelioration program for the sugar in\u00addustry;\r\n3. Establishing a Magna Carta for small farmers which seeks to further improve agricultural productivity and income; and\r\n4. Providing for a code governing the development and conserva\u00adtion of our fishery and aquatic resources.\r\nThird, to further strengthen local autonomy: the immediate passage of the Local Government Code; particularly, the provisions rationalizing the allotment system to increase funds at the disposal of local government units.\r\nFourth, to further emphasize our concern for protection of the environment, the passage of the following bills:\r\n1. Providing for comprehensive anti-pollution measures, includ\u00ading increased penalties for violations thereof;\r\n2. Increasing charges for the cutting of timber and other forest products to levels that better reflect their economic value; and\r\n3. Updating the 53-year old Public Land Law to conform to new realities.\r\nFifth, to enhance the equity and progressive character of our tax system, the passage of a tax reform package which includes, among others, the following bills:\r\n1. Increase in personal exemptions from income tax;\r\n2. Imposition of the affluent consumption tax;\r\n3. Provision of ceilings on certain business deductions;\r\n4. Conversion of the ad valorem tax on oil products to specific tax; and\r\n5. Gradual phaseout of the gross receipts tax on banks to help cut intermediation cost.\r\nSixth, to underscore our sovereignty and independent foreign policy:\r\n1. The passage of the law creating the Baselands Development Authority to implement the bases conversion plan which will be submitted by the Legislative-Executive Bases Council; and\r\n2. The passage of a law upgrading our Foreign Service Corps. Seventh, to accelerate the upgrading of our transportation system:\r\na. The passage of a law increasing the capitalization of the Philip\u00adpine National Railways; and\r\nb. A law increasing the capitalization of the Light Rail Transit Authority.\r\nAnd eighth, to strengthen the safeguards of our democracy, the passage of the following measures:\r\n1. A revised bill repealing Presidential Decree 1850 thereby strengthening civilian supremacy over the military;\r\n2. The anti-coup and the anti-plunder bills;\r\n3. A bill providing for a witness protection program;\r\n4. Omnibus amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act; and\r\n5. The passage of electoral reform measures.\r\nI join our people in thanking the ladies and gentlemen of both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the continuing legislative support you have given to our nation\u2019s aspiration for greater productivity and reform.\r\nI cite in particular your work on the following legislation of national importance: Republic Act No. 6810 or the Magna Carta for Countryside and Barangay Business Enterprises; Republic Act No. 6763 on the con\u00adstruction of concrete barangay roads and multipurpose pavements; Re\u00adpublic Act No. 6849 on the installation of municipal public telephones; Republic Act No. 6826 on the grant of emergency powers to the president; and Republic Act No. 6948 upgrading the benefits of military veterans and their dependents.\r\nI also acknowledge your help in the passage of the following laws:\r\nRepublic Act No. 6846 creating the Abot-Kaya Pabahay Fund; Republic Act Nos. 6938 and 6939 on the Cooperative Code and the Cooperative Development Authority; Republic Act No. 6952 establishing the Petro\u00adleum Price Standby Fund; Republic Act No. 6956 modifying the excise tax on certain products; and Republic Act No. 6957 on the financing of infrastructure projects by the private sector.\r\nI look forward to our continuing cooperation as we endeavor to keep the agenda of our nation foremost in our list of priorities.\r\nAs President, I reiterate my commitment to institute greater reforms during the next two years of this Presidency. I am aware of the many obstacles strewn in our path by those who wish to waylay our march towards our goals. I wish to assure you and the rest of our countrymen that I shall never be intimidated; there shall be no rest from my work until the task is completed.\r\nBut our success would not be possible without unity among us. I therefore ask you, Honorable Senators and Representatives of this our people\u2019s Congress, and the rest of our leaders, to renew with me our commitment to the dream that bound us together in 1986: democracy, freedom, sovereignty, economic growth, social justice.\r\nLet us join hands with our people as we undertake the task of rebuilding, and as we resume our march towards our goals.\r\nI should like to thank all our friends throughout the world\u2014govern\u00adments, institutions, as well as individuals\u2014for the humanitarian assist\u00adance given to our people and the victims of the earthquake.\r\nI intend to properly thank and commend them, along with all those who acted valiantly to save lives, at appropriate ceremonies in the near future.\r\nThe National Disaster Coordinating Council is hereby directed to submit to me at the soonest possible time the full list of these friends and these heroes.\r\nMay katiyakan ang ating tagumpay kung tayo\u2019y magkakaisa. Kung kaya\u2019t hinihimok ko kayo\u2014kagalang-galang na mga Senador, Kongresista, at ang iba pang mga pinuno ng bayan\u2014na muli tayong manumpa sa pangarap na nagbigkis sa atin noong 1986: ibalik at panatiliin ang demokrasya, kalayaan, karapatan, katatagang pangkabuhayan, at katarungang panlipunan.\r\nMula sa halos ganap na pagkawasak na ating naranasan, tayong lahat ay magkapit-bisig upang magampanan natin ang ating tungkulin na itayong muli ang napinsala sa atin, nang sa gayon ay makapagpatuloy tayo sa landas tungo sa ating inaasam na mga layunin.\r\nMagkaisa tayo. Magtulungan tayo. Maraming salamat po.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},

Aquino", "text": "VIDEO:\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNdgTokgws[/youtube]\r\nFULL TRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 24, 1989]\r\nMr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; members of both Houses of Con\u00adgress; Mr. Vice President and the members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nPursuant to the Constitution, I have come to report on the state of the na\u00adtion. This recurring event, however, has another significance today. For it comes midway in my term of office. It is time to review what has gone before, how things stand today, and what must be done tomorrow.\r\nThree and a half years have passed since the revolution. Recalling the perils we passed, and the ground we have covered, I marvel at the kindness of God and the strength of our people\u2014at the fortitude and ingenuity of a race that did so much with so little, and in so short a time.\r\nWe revived a dead economy and in three years had it well on the road to recovery. The figures are well-known and unimpeachable, yet some bear repeat\u00ading.\r\nIndustrial capacity, idle for lack of capital, markets, and confidence under the dictatorship, has been fully utilized. In the past two years, investments have increased 25% annually. P30.97 billion was invested in 1988. Industry grew by 8.6% in gross value added last year, improving yet further on the already im\u00adpressive growth of 7.7% in 1987.\r\nThe number of business enterprises increased by 38%, most of them small- and medium-scale and located outside Metro Manila.\r\nMore than 2.3 million new jobs have been created. Unemployment declined from 12.5% in 1985 to 9.6% in 1988.\r\nLast year, we posted a 6.7% growth. This year, we anticipate less because of a slight contraction of the world economy and the shift from consumer-led to the more substantive but slower investment-led growth that we see as the safer course to take.\r\nThe economic upturn is reflected in the reduction of industrial actions. The exuberance of a suddenly liberated labor sector has made room for a deeper appreciation of the need for all sectors to work together\u2014rather than against each other\u2014for the general improvement. Let us not, however, use the reduction in strikes by itself as an invitation to more investments, but rather as a barometer of the more equitable distribution of the progress we are making. We are instructed by this welcome development to work towards even greater equity in the distribution of wealth as the surest means to social order and peace.\r\nOur greatest investment in enhancing national productive capacity is in education\u2014in developing the intelligence and the sinews of our people, as it were.\r\nThus, we have put 98% of school-age children in school; we are close to universal elementary education. The universal free high school program is also well under way. Ouantitatively, we are close to our targets; qualitatively we are far. A rigorous and high quality secondary education, the Japanese and Ger\u00adman experiences teach, is the foundation of a modern economy.\r\nLast year, 70.9% of all infants one year old or younger were immunized, representing 1,318,000 babies\u2014a dramatic improvement over 30% in 1985; 7.7 million children were treated for various illnesses. Our aim, as we said, is shar\u00adper minds and sounder bodies for the next generation of Filipinos.\r\nYet poverty remains prevalent. The lowest 30% of our population remains mired in unchanging misery. They think nothing has changed and I don\u2019t blame them. Liberty is a poor substitute for food. The economic improvement we have experienced has had some impact on the incidence of poverty, which declined from 59% in 1985 to 49% in 1988. But the 500,000 families who crossed the of\u00adficial poverty threshold may not even be aware of it.\r\nThe economic recovery has restored old fortunes far more significantly than it has touched the lives of the vast majority of our people. For all that, we can\u00adnot downplay our economic progress. For it has spoken more eloquently to the world than words ever could. It has earned us tremendous respect throughout the world. This was shown in the Tokyo Consultative Group meeting which paid tribute to the country\u2019s growth with low inflation, despite the debt. A similar respect was evident throughout my European visit. My hosts were clearly en\u00adcouraged to support what they saw as a record of success against great odds. We have been working to translate this respect into concrete support to reduce those odds.\r\nYet nothing generated greater admiration than our political achievements.\r\nIn little over a year, we uprooted a dictatorship and planted the freest democracy in the world\u2014with all its good and bad features. We held elections that were the freest and most participative in the history of this\u2014perhaps of any\u2014republic in the world.\r\nOur swift democratization was done against the advice that I reserve emer\u00adgency powers in the face of rising military adventurism and communist terrorism. But I believed then\u2014and time has proved me right\u2014that this nation shall find no greater source of strength to defend democracy than in the enjoyment of all its rights and liberties. Democracy is our faith and the root of our strength to defend it.\r\nAdded to that faith was the will to stand for no more nonsense from military adventurers who thought that failure to shave qualified them for national leader\u00adship. Some people don\u2019t like the way I dress. Well I didn\u2019t like the way they looked. I am in power and they are out. [\r\n] Surely there is a lesson here to be learned about delusions of self-importance and the realities of power.\r\nMy assessment of the peace and order situation is mixed. With regard to the insurgency, the tide has turned\u2014I believe\u2014permanently. The main weapons were democracy, a greater concern by government for rural needs, the economic recovery, a heightened respect for political and human rights, and a deeper commitment to their proper mission on the part of the Armed Forces. The AFP reports an 8% reduction in NPA troop strength. A better indicator is the brutality with which the Communist leadership has treated the common people and even their own ranks. This self-destructive course reveals a move\u00adment whose organizational and moral center has ceased to hold. This picture of disarray is both good news and bad. For we must brace ourselves for greater cruelties from a cause that is now indistinguishable from a common crime. In summary, we have beaten the insurgents less by fighting than by the example of our humanity, our concern, and the impact of our economic progress.\r\nOn the subject of common crimes, the situation is nothing less than terrible. What compounds it is the general distress occasioned by the prominence of military and police elements in the worst criminal activities. The first duty of the State is the enforcement of order. Until we\u2014the executive, the Congress, and the judiciary\u2014bring the situation totally under control, none of our accomplish\u00adments elsewhere will have a lasting impact on the opinion of the public. For criminality threatens the most basic rights of man\u2014the right to live, to raise a family, and enjoy and bequeath the prosperity he has worked for.\r\nI recall our achievements not to make the past compensate for the present nor to excuse inaction in the future, but so we do not lose faith in the essential strength of our race to rebuild, to recuperate, to grow, and to meet the challen\u00adges that lie ahead.\r\nThere is the challenge of rising world oil prices that threatens to undercut our continued growth.\r\nThere is the challenge of continuing debt service that eats 40% of the na\u00adtional budget, or 7.7% of GNP. We are expected, in the next five years, to make a net payment to our creditors of $12 billion or approximately P260 billion at the current exchange rate.\r\nThere is the challenge of sustaining growth and meeting our medium-term targets.\r\nAnd there is the age-old challenge and threat that poverty and under\u00addevelopment pose to the viability of democracies in the Third World. How long can we stay poor and still be free?\r\nPoverty has lessened but 5.3 million households or 29 million people remain poor. Unemployment has been reduced but try telling that to the 2.9 million still jobless and the 7.2 million underemployed.\r\nFor these reasons, we critically need to sustain economic growth.\r\nFirst, we have to strengthen the foundations of a vigorous market-oriented economy. This would involve continued adherence to prudent fiscal and monetary policies and reliance on market forces in the functioning of the economy. These policies have engendered robust growth of private investment, output, employment, and consumption. These have also kept inflation at accept\u00adable levels and helped protect the real incomes of wage earners. Our record of high growth with low inflation is a singular achievement among heavily indebted countries.\r\nWe must steer away from the siren songs of quick fixes, easy spending, un\u00adwarranted subsidies, and irrational price controls, which elsewhere have contributed to bloated deficits, tailspin hyperinflation, and social instability.\r\nSecond, we must go on building structures essential to the efficiency and productivity of the economy. Government has improved or constructed 1,124 kilometers of major roads and 7,821 kilometers of secondary and feeder roads to bring markets and producers closer to each other. Yet this is a small part of the projects in the pipeline\u2014numerous ports, power generation plants, and modern telecommunications.\r\nThird, no less important than physical infrastructure, we must continue to strengthen our public institutions and find ways to do things better, faster, and with the greater appearance and substance of integrity. I have a few words to say on the subject of corruption. Yesterday, a pastoral letter was read in all the churches deploring the resurgence of official corruption. How can the Cabinet, the Congress, and the Supreme Court deny what is plain for all to see: that cor\u00adruption is again a way of public life?\r\nI will not preempt a Congress that feels its time is better spent in investiga\u00adtions of anything, nor a Supreme Court that has a longer backlog of unresolved cases than there are decisions in the casebooks from the turn of the century. I have my own responsibilities to face, and my own people to hold to account. [\r\n]\r\nThe magnitude of unresolved disputes has frozen innumerable billions of pesos worth of assets in litigation. The staggering number of unsolved crimes has eroded the credibility of the state to be respected as such.\r\nThe problem is massive for having been left unattended by the branch of government, and the departments and agencies specifically charged with the dispensation of justice and the punishment of crimes. But a start must be made.\r\nI have ordered a review of the structure and performance of the National Bureau of Investigation with a view to making it the lead arm in criminal inves\u00adtigation. I have ordered a review of the prosecution service, and call upon the Supreme Court to do the same to the judiciary, with a view to relieving the in\u00adcompetent and the passive who have allowed so many cases to languish unresolved.\r\nI am tired of being taken to task for the thing above all others that I wanted to leave as a legacy: the example of a clean and honest government. To my fel\u00adlow workers in government specifically involved in this area\u2014and in all other areas as well\u2014let me say that unless the public sees results soon, it will be good\u00adbye for you. [\r\n]\r\nThe compassion that marked my administration in the past may generate doubts about my resolve in this matter, but the actions that will be taken by me in the next weeks and months will dispel them all. [\r\n]\r\nFourth, as the lynchpin of our efforts to lift the mass of our people from poverty, we must implement agrarian reform with greater vigor, doing our best to combine speed with the necessary caution. I would like to stress again the aim of agrarian reform. Our objective is not merely to subdivide the misery of the land, but to raise the living standards of our farmers to the level of their dig\u00adnity as the backbone of our economy.\r\nFifth, for our development to be at all sustainable, we need to redress the years of degradation and neglect of our environment, and preserve what remains of our natural resources. We have embarked on projects to restore and conserve our marine and forest resources\u2014among them the largest reforesta\u00adtion program in history, covering 100,000 hectares a year to the end of the century.\r\nSixth, we must mobilize the resources, both domestic and foreign, neces\u00adsary to sustain public and private investment and provide basic social services. To generate domestic resources, vigorous tax collection efforts, banking reforms, and the development of capital markets are under way. Measures to enhance public confidence in the stock markets are needed and I look to the Congress to study and initiate them.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of improving our tax performance.\r\nWe have one of the lowest tax-to-GNP ratios of any country in the world. No longer can we tolerate tax evasion as a national pastime, especially of the rich, when indeed our economic future is at stake. The place for tax evaders is not high society but behind bars. [\r\n]\r\nAs regards external financing resources, except for one component we have installed a financing structure which will support sustained growth.\r\nWe are currently engaged in negotiations with commercial creditors for a package that will support our external financing program. An important ele\u00adment of this package will include debt and debt service reduction schemes inspired by new debt initiatives. By firm adherence to its strong record of economic adjustment and performance, the Philippines is particularly well placed to be favored by these initiatives.\r\nWith the endorsement of the multilateral institutions and foreign govern\u00adments\u2014and in the conviction that we have done our part in keeping our economic house in order\u2014we shall negotiate forcefully to secure the cooperation of the commercial banks in the Philippine recovery. In the riot-torn streets of Caracas, in the teeming barrios of Mexico, in our own barangays\u2014no less than in Washington, Tokyo, and Paris\u2014there is growing recognition that something real must be done about the Third World debt.\r\nLet us not forget that we have come from a 20-year struggle between our people and a dictator, and that we are here engaged in the reconstruction of an economy and a polity as though from the ruins of war. Except the destruction has been more sweeping. We did not emerge from the Second World War with losses anywhere near the $28 billion being exacted by our creditors.\r\nOur principal focus must be on rural development-the liberation of the economic, social, and political energies of the countryside. We need the physi\u00adcal infrastructure to link rural production and consumption with the national and international economies. We need to enhance education and health to make the best use of our best assets\u2014our people. We need to decentralize political structures to widen the people\u2019s participation in national life.\r\nA people-powered revolution must aim for a people-empowered democracy and economy. Rural development will best realize this aim. The al\u00adleviation of poverty will come with the upliftment of the rural poor.\r\nUnless we draw our rural areas into the dynamics of the national economy, turning hinterlands of decay into frontiers of progress, our growth and equity goals will not be attained, neither in the short nor the long term.\r\nThe great task that we have set ourselves will require two great instruments of social transformation: a just but iron-fisted law and good government.\r\nThere will be no progress in our communities without order, without secur\u00ading the lives and properties of our citizens against criminality and the insurgency.\r\nI have already noted the progress that has been made against the insurgen\u00adcy. The increasing isolation of the rebels has allowed military operations to succeed as never before. But such operations must take greater care to avoid collateral damage to the civilian population. For our moral ascendancy has ac\u00adcounted for the greater part of our superiority in this conflict. The protection of human rights even under conditions of conflict must be a key consideration in military operations and missions.\r\nOur other great task is to deliver good government. This, I believe, consists of maintaining closeness to the people, honesty and efficiency in their service, and making a difference for the better in their lives. Thus, I have brought an active presidency to bear on the many issues that shape our lives from police work to women\u2019s concerns, from improving customs collections to disaster relief operations. I have brought the physical presence of the presidency to 54 provin\u00adces, from Tawi-Tawi to Batanes.\r\nI shall emphasize even further the standard of my example by exacting the same dedication and discipline\u2014from my Cabinet, the bureaucracy, and the local governments. A quarterly review of departmental performance shall become the forum for diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of programs and per\u00adformance, and the basis for the proper remedies.\r\nI expect to see the departments pull together in more coherent and focused efforts to advance policies and programs across the board, and to translate this address into action. The process should involve the participation of mayors and governors, and consultation with members of Congress.\r\nOn local autonomy and decentralization, it was never my intention to sub\u00adstitute the abuses of overcentralization with widespread incompetence in local leadership. Our people will simply regard both as our failure. Thus, as we devolve greater authority and resources to local governments, we shall exact from them greater responsibility to their communities and more support of the national objectives.\r\nI call also on the support of constitutional bodies, such as the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Audit and the Ombudsman. Even as they per\u00adform their duties with the required independence and integrity, let them be reminded that good government can be achieved as well by cooperation as by adversarial relations. The purpose of checks in government is not to induce paralysis but to achieve balance and foster progress.\r\nAs we emerge from a singular preoccupation with economic recovery, we must remind ourselves of initiatives that will have a major impact now and profound implications tomorrow. Three particular priorities are: the protection of the environment, the promotion of family planning and responsible parent\u00adhood, and the development of science and technology.\r\nWhile the lead in the environmental movement must be taken by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, responsibility must be as\u00adsumed by all of us. While the Department of Health is the designated lead agency for family planning, we should all contribute towards building the fami\u00adly as a purposeful act of confidence in the future. The Department of Science and Technology needs to bring academe, government and business together in promoting science and technology.\r\nOur gains in the past three years serve as the base for launching a com\u00adprehensive advance on all fronts. The scale of the effort and the importance of the outcome call for the wisdom of Congress to consider and affirm these in\u00adtentions. I propose the following:\r\nFirst, measures to alleviate poverty:\r\n1. Tax and other incentives to small and medium countryside business enterprises;\r\n2. Authorizing the bidding out to the private sector of BOT projects, or projects to build, operate, and transfer self-liquidating infrastructure projects; and\r\n3. Promoting countryside investments.\r\nSecond, measures to improve peace and order:\r\n1. Immediate creation of a civilian national police force;\r\n2. Limiting discretion in the disposition of seized importations;\r\n3. Penalizing the crime of plunder to deter the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth by public officials; and\r\n4. Further protecting human rights.\r\nThird, measures promoting honesty and efficiency in the government:\r\n1. Devolution of more substantial powers to local governments;\r\n2. Doubling the financial resources of local governments effective 1990 by increasing internal revenue allotments, granting incentives for im\u00adproved real estate tax collections, and abolishing mandatory contributions to the PC-INP and hospitals;\r\n3. Reorganizing and strengthening the Philippine foreign service.\r\nFourth, measures promoting social justice:\r\n1. Defining ancestral domains;\r\n2. Providing a more extensive program of urban housing development;\r\n3. Setting ceilings and limiting deductions on travel, representation, and other expenses;\r\n4. Encouraging cooperatives; and\r\n5. Rationalizing small-scale mining.\r\nFinally, measures for the protection of the environment:\r\n1. Increasing forest charges;\r\n2. Increasing penalties for pollution; and\r\n3. Adopting a national land use plan.\r\nFinally, I seek your support for the 1990 budget that I shall be submitting in the next few days. I ask you to consider our proposals in light of the priorities I have outlined, and the deep concerns that we all share for the upliftment of our people from poverty, and of our nation to progress. I ask you to regard with sympathy and understanding my deep desire and my unshakable resolve to give our people all that I have promised them. Let me make myself especially clear on this point: I shall complete the work that we have started, the work that God gave us to do\u2014to make a new nation, strong, and free, and prosperous. I shall not rest from that labor until its fruits have been enjoyed by you, by me, and by all our people. Only success will stop my unceasing efforts, my undying commitment to the great task before us.\r\nGod bless us all. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! [\r\n] [\r\n]\r\n", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1993-07-26 01:10:53+00:00", "author": "Fidel V. Ramos", "text": "[Delivered at the Batsang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 1993]\r\nMr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker of the House; ladies and gentlemen of Congress; Your Excellencies; special guests; mahal na kababayan:\r\nNoong isang taon, ang ating mga kababayan ay naghahangad ng panibagong pagsisimula. Ngayon, tapatan nating masasabi na nabigyan natin ang ating bansa ng bagong pag-asa.\r\nA year ago, our people asked of us a new beginning.\r\nToday, we can truly claim we have given our country that fresh start.\r\nWe have arrested the decline\u2014of the economy and the national spirit\u2014which had so demoralized our people.\r\nWe are concluding a just and honorable peace with the military rebels, the insurgents, and the southern secessionists.\r\nA new spirit of cooperation existing between Congress and the presidency has avoided the gridlock which obstructed policy making in previous administrations. And this is as it should be. Executive and legislature are not meant to function in confrontation with each other.\r\nOur investors and businessmen can almost take political stability for granted once again. The stock market index has reached a record high.\r\nIt is true that in some of our concerns\u2014as in the economy\u2014the forward movement has barely begun. There is still so much to be done. But today I can report to you of a country and people renewed in purpose.\r\nAnalyzing our situation in April, the World Bank noted:\r\nThe Philippines now faces its best prospect for sustained development in almost two decades. A window of opportunity exists for the new government.\r\nThis optimism about our prospects is not unusual. It is shared by many\u2014here and abroad. But \u201ca window of opportunity\u201d is only that. A momentary opening\u2014which can close sooner than we expect.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress:\r\nI invite you to join me in taking advantage of this opportunity and to seize the decisive moment together.\r\nThis is the challenge to leadership. Everywhere the old politics is in disfavor\u2014because it has failed to respond to the transformations taking place in the world.\r\nWe must learn new ways of looking at the world. We need new answers to our problems. In this spirit, we offer a strategic framework for Philippine development.\r\nModernization in our time requires the guidance and direction of a stable and resolute government.\r\nCompare the Philippine State with the East Asian dragons. The East Asian States are able to assert their countries\u2019 strategic interests because they are relatively free from the influence of pressure groups. The Philippine State, in the past, had been unable to act consistently in the national interest because it could not resist the importunings of oligarchic groups. And the economy had been governed largely by politics instead of markets.\r\nBecause of this experience, we now know that development cannot take place in our country unless we put our house in order. And this\u2014to me\u2014means accomplishing three things: One, restoring political and civic stability. Two, opening the economy: dismantling monopolies and cartels injurious to the public interest, and leveling the playing field of enterprise. Three, addressing the problem of corruption and criminality.\r\nThese three tasks\u2014once completed\u2014shall secure the environment for self-sustaining growth\u2014and enable the government to positively and consistently act in the national interest.\r\nOur strategic framework to establish effective government\u2014of putting our house in order\u2014so that our drive for development can begin\u2014we call \u201cPhilippines 2000.\u201d\r\n\u201cPhilippines 2000\u201d has two components.\r\nThe first is the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1993-1998 [MTPDP 93-98]. Guided by the principles of people empowerment and global excellence, it proposes specific policies and programs to stimulate economic activity and mobilize the entrepreneurial spirit in ordinary Filipinos. I strongly urge your approval of this medium-term Philippine development plan.\r\nThe second component of \u201cPhilippines 2000\u201d addresses the larger environment\u2014the political, social, and cultural climate\u2014in which economic growth must take place.\r\nThe crucial question is: Can we reform an undemocratic economy by using a democratic political framework?\r\nAuthoritarianism eased the way to economic power and higher living standards for our East Asian neighbors. In contrast, we are working to reconcile our democratic politics with an oligarchic economy left over from the colonial period\u2014not by changing the political system, but by democratizing the economy.\r\nThe time for authoritarianism has passed\u2014in our country and in the world. Instead of the discipline of command, we must invoke the self-discipline of civic responsibility.\r\nWe Filipinos have always accepted that people with more are obliged to help people with less\u2014in the name of a common, compassionate humanity. This traditional moral code we shall make a principle of public policy.\r\nThe few who have can never be secure in their possessions for as long as they live among so many who have not. Let me now take up our most urgent sectoral concerns one by one.\r\nExamples from East Asia teach us that the first\u2014and foremost\u2014requirement of economic development is stability, which is the long-term predictability of the social system. This is why we are seeking a comprehensive and lasting peace. As proposed by the National Unification Commission, we will pursue the \u201cpaths to peace\u201d by undertaking social, economic, and political reforms that address the root causes of armed conflict; by encouraging people to participate in the peace process; by working for a negotiated settlement with the armed groups; and by establishing programs for the reintegration of rebel groups into the mainstream of society through a general amnesty program. At the same time, let us effect the modernization of our Armed Forces. The cooling down of tensions in the region enables us to set new priorities in defense spending.\r\nPeace and order are the other face of national stability. If we are to release the full energies of the nation, people who live, work, and produce must be secure in their persons, in their property, and in their homes. We have enhanced our institutional capability to cope with crime\u2014through the overhaul of the command-and-leadership structure of the Philippine National Police. To this end, I propose that the PNP law (R.A. 6975) be amended to correct its many weaknesses. We will dismantle the private armies that remain. We will not allow any more criminal brotherhoods, as in Calauan, to exist. This includes purging local police forces of scalawags and bullies. Last year, I proposed we restore the death penalty. I ask you to enact that measure as soon as possible. We must show determination to prevent any reversions to barbarism. In particular, I see the merit of bringing the anti-crime effort to the level of the barangay and the neighborhood\u2014by evolving new forms of collaboration between citizens and law enforcers. This way, we can steadily constrict the space where crime can operate. The challenge is clear: Crime can only come under full control when criminals\u2014in or out of government\u2014know we\u2019re going to catch them, convict them, and jail them.\r\nOpening the economy is, likewise, a political task. In order to level the field of competition, we need to dismantle the structure of protectionism and controls, and restructure the monopolies and cartels that operate against public interest. On the other hand, we must encourage and support Filipino and Philippine-based corporations that have proven their efficiency, competitiveness, and civic consciousness. the critical question is no longer whether we will grow. It is how we can sustain and speed up this process. We have experienced a full year of steady, although unspectacular, growth. In the first three quarters of this administration, our GNP in real terms increased by an average of 1.3%. This is indeed modest\u2014compared to the galloping growth of our neighbors. But this is no mean achievement, given our crippling power crisis. You gave me powers to break some of the barriers to the construction of generating plants that prolonged the crisis. We, in turn, ploughed through the maze of regulations and opened the gate.\r\nToday, new plants are operating and others are under construction. The economy will soon have the power needed for growth. The power crisis is on its way to resolution because of the united actions of Congress and the executive branch. This is where our strength lies, in unity of purpose and harmony of actions. But these alone will not be sufficient for the economy to be strong and resilient for global competition. We therefore also have introduced reforms to restructure the system in favor of efficiency away from protecting the inefficient. We will continue policies of sound monetary management and containment of public sector deficits to ensure that private sector enterprise will invest, expand production, generate employment, and realize fair returns, particularly for exporters. As the power crisis eases, and as we carry out structural reforms, the economy should accelerate. The indicators are increasingly hopeful, such as:\r\nBut against these, we must admit these undeniable shortcomings:\r\nWhat must we do so reforms will result in a robust and expanded economy? First and foremost, we must not relent in our campaign to level the field of business competition: Global competitiveness must begin at home. Government will not retreat in its campaign against injurious monopolies and tax evaders. And so, I ask for the urgent passage of anti-trust and anti-racketeering legislation.\r\nLet us recognize that an economy controlled by rent-seekers cannot produce free competition and efficiency. The economy must be open to all who bring in new capital, new knowledge, new ideas, and new levels of efficiency. We must broaden the base of economic participation. Let us, therefore, make this Ninth Congress the instrument to free and democratize our economy. By all means, let us join hands in an economic summit\u2014the sooner, the better.\r\nThe independent Central Monetary Authority assures us of a new regime of price stability. Opening of the financial system to foreign banks should bring more foreign investment and expertise. We have substantially recovered from the balance-of-payments crisis in the mid-eighties. The 1992 commercial bank restructuring package largely put to rest our problem on commercial debt. This year, we reentered the international capital market. Our two bond issues have been oversubscribed\u2014confirming our credit-worthiness and international confidence in our future. But we must be prudent in availing of such credits. Instead, we should turn more to grants, concessional credits, and long-term loans. These will help fund our development projects. In response to recent reports on a supposed change in debt policy, let me state very clearly that it is in our national interest to maintain our current policy. Let us not risk curtailment of credit flows and cut the lifeline of business and commerce.\r\nI will soon submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of Congress, our proposed budget for 1994\u2014detailing how we intend to finance our development plan. Our spending plan clearly states our priorities on how to do more with less. We will put the highest priority in those activities that pay the most dividends in productivity and growth. And we must resist the usual temptation to spend merely on what is popular just to win votes. The 1994 budgets should be approved by Congress well before Christmas 1993, well before the lights go on again at that time.\r\nTo meet the requirements of the development plan, we must mobilize resources through greater revenue generation rather than excessive borrowings.\r\nWe have to increase revenues to cover current shortfalls and fund public expenditures.\r\nOur tax base has been eroded by proliferation of exemptions, infirmities of tax laws, deficiencies in collections, and widespread evasion. Tax exemptions, while well meant, are often abused by the underserving. The revenues lost from the exemptions have escalated from P3.3 billion in 1986 to P25 billion in 1992\u2014or two-thirds of the capital budget of the national government for 1993. This amount does not even include exemptions which have not been monitored.\r\nSo let us review existing exemption laws and replace them for those deserving beneficiaries with direct budget support\u2014so that the whole system will be transparent, accountable, and manageable.\r\nWe also have to cure infirmities in tax laws\u2014such as deductions for married couples with joint incomes.\r\nIn your last session, this Congress passed laws to strengthen the enforcement powers of our revenue agencies. For these I am truly grateful.\r\nI have ordered both Commissioners of Internal Revenue and of Customs to use these powers to go relentlessly after evaders, smugglers, and dishonest collectors.\r\nI am convinced that citizens will faithfully comply with their tax obligations if there are no free riders on their backs. But because of existing contractual obligations, the payoff from tax reforms may not be sufficient to finance the needs of development. I therefore ask the support of Congress for a new revenue package for urgent enactment. This will widen the tax base and rationalize the existing structure.\r\nReforms in tax administration must aim to achieve simplicity, uniformity, and efficiency. This is the best way to arrest the present epidemic of tax avoidance and evasion.\r\nGrowth cannot take place without some sacrifice from everyone of us. But let us agree that the tax burden must fall heaviest on those who can best bear it.\r\nBut we must not tax at levels that will become a drag on the economy. Consequently, I also ask your help to tap other public funds in special and trust accounts, such as those of the Philippine Tourism Authority and the duty-free shop, and make these available for our budget program. The law creating the Central Monetary Authority adds to the heavy demands on scarce fiscal resources that cannot be entirely covered by additional tax revenues.\r\nFor our part, we will accelerate sales of public assets and shares in private corporations, and get government out of the business of the private sector. I therefore ask you to extend the life of the committee on privatization and the asset privatization trust, which otherwise will end this year.\r\nI also urge Congress to set guidelines for the Presidential Commission on Good Government in making compromise settlements on ill-gotten wealth cases\u2014on terms fair to the government and only with those who have demonstrated commitment to help in the development of our country.\r\nMy vision of a tax system is a broad-based one with just a few exemptions and at rates that yield no premium to tax evasion, where all enterprises and citizens carry their equitable share.\r\nCongress has acted quickly\u2014and decisively\u2014on the framework for investments.\r\nWe now have a real opportunity to secure a fair share of the investments flowing into the ASEAN region. What is important is that we continue to improve our country\u2019s attractiveness for investments\u2014by emphasizing our comparative advantage.\r\nManufacturing and other industrial activities can proceed with greater vigor as the power situation improves in terms of competitiveness and productivity. We will champion exports as the key to sustainable economic growth.\r\nAnd we will redouble our efforts to disperse industries to the countryside with emphasis on the small and medium enterprises.\r\nThe former military baselands\u2014which were the cause of so much concern on the departure of the U.S. military\u2014have now become attractive sites for economic expansion.\r\nSubic has become one of our brightest areas for foreign investment. Similarly, we have been able to move substantially to transform Clark Air Base and Camp John Hay from calamity areas to growth centers.\r\nWe have identified key production areas [KPAs] for specific commodities\u2014areas where not just soil and climate but also markets are most suitable. For example, if we concentrated on growing rice and corn only where they will best grow, with adequate irrigation we can produce as much grain\u2014as we have been producing on 5 million hectares\u2014on only 2 million hectares.\r\nWe can then free some 3 million hectares now devoted to marginal rice and corn growing to other uses\u2014to\u00a0pasture, to aquaculture, and to high-value crops. These efforts in agriculture must be matched by equally resolute efforts at agrarian reform. This reform has been often pledged, but only half-heartedly redeemed.\r\nMy administration has stepped up the pace of the CARP implementation. During this first year, we have acquired, distributed and titled some 382,000 hectares, with nearly a quarter of a million farmers benefited. This is 41% of all land titles distributed by the Department of Agrarian Reform during the last 30 years.\r\nBut you and I know agrarian reform is more than just the redistribution of land. We have therefore taken decisive steps also to ensure that the land remains productive for farmers. We increased agricultural support services and livelihood assistance to CARP beneficiaries. We encouraged them to organize cooperatives and to take advantage of economies of scale to enhance their productivity.\r\nLast year we launched 257 agrarian reform communities [ARCs] nationwide\u2014with at least one in each congressional district in the countryside\u2014where farmer-beneficiaries can better feel the impact of localized support services in terms of higher incomes.\r\nOur goal is to have 1,000 of these ARCs of progress by 1998. This is not enough, however, for the kind of rural transformation that we seek. We have to conserve agricultural lands. That is why our tax package includes a land conversion tax.\r\nIn tourism, we are beginning to reap dividends from our efforts to improve the country\u2019s image and develop \u201cenvironment-friendly ecotourism.\u201d\r\nTourist arrivals reached 1.15 million in 1992\u2014up by nearly 200,000 compared to 1991. These generated tourist receipts of some $1.7 billion, an increase of 30.6% over the previous year\u2019s.\r\nTourism arrangements made with our ASEAN neighbors and new tourism estate development will boost our earnings from this source.\r\nIn infrastructure, we have requirements long neglected. Our network of roads, bridges, air and sea ports is grossly overloaded and poorly maintained.\r\nSince the funding for our infrastructure development needs is immense, I propose the amendment of the Build-Operate-Transfer law to encourage greater participation from private capital. Such participation must now be motivated by risk reward for efficiency and without the guarantee of government.\r\nIn energy, the dark time is almost over. By year-end, we shall have added 900 megawatts to the Luzon grid. This should\u2014once and for all\u2014put an end to the brownouts in households in Luzon.\r\nBy the second half of 1994, we shall have reliable power service for industry.\r\nIn the Visayas, power has been adequate, and projects are ongoing to be sure that no deficiency occurs.\r\nIn Mindanao, the National Power Corporation has just announced the complete restoration of power normalcy effective today.\r\nIn rural electrification, we have energized 94% of all our towns and cities, and 63% of our barangays. But we should strive harder so that more of our countrymen shall have electricity. There are bills in Congress which we support to strengthen the NEA to enable it to carry out its mission better.\r\nWe continue to develop geothermal energy\u2014a competitively priced, indigenous, and environment-friendly option. PNOC\u2019s additional plants between now and 1998 will increase baseload geothermal capacity by 150%. More geothermal resources must be found. We therefore urge Congress to enact the Geothermal Bill to encourage more exploration.\r\nOur development program in power is indeed designed to provide comprehensively for our industrial future.\r\nIn the past, many nations\u2014ours included\u2014tried to attain wealth by withdrawing from their ecological capital. We are all now paying dearly to restore what we took out of our forests in the past.\r\nSo while we still can, we must seek growth that does not exploit our country\u2019s natural wealth. Thus, we strongly uphold our commitment to the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21\u2014which is the global blueprint for sustainable development.\r\nOver the past year, we banned logging in virgin forests, and restricted harvesting to second-growth timber. We continue to pursue a no-nonsense campaign against illegal loggers.\r\nWe strictly enforced the interim guidelines on land use conversion to preserve prime agricultural land.\r\nWe initiated the use of low-lead and sulfur-free gasoline.\r\nAnd we closed down Smokey Mountain while providing alternative livelihood options for its residents.\r\nNevertheless, we need to provide an environmental protection outlook on old and new problems. We are therefore submitting new codes covering mining, land management, forestry, and fishery. In addition, we need laws to improve solid waste management and to set up a nationwide potable water program for our communities.\r\nA bureaucracy that is mission-driven, and manned by a well-motivated and innovative workforce, provides the foundation upon which we can pursue our goals vigorously. This is a critical requirement for securing our environment for development\u2014a civil service honest and efficient to facilitate the workings of the free market.\r\nOne of my first moves was to issue Memorandum Order No. 27, ordering all departments and agencies to eliminate duplication of functions, achieve greater cost-effectiveness, and rechannel resources to priority projects.\r\nBut our efforts have been hampered by multiple barriers to change\u2014which are, ironically, engraved in the civil service law. Although it was not so intended, the civil service law sometimes acts as a brake on efforts at reform.\r\nIt is time we addressed this issue together. Give me the authority to reorganize the bureaucracy\u2014and I assure you that we shall achieve the kind of organization required for efficient, effective, and quality administration.\r\nBy the same token, let us recognize that an efficient bureaucracy depends on decently paid civil servants. I ask Congress to amend our existing compensation laws\u2014so that government can begin to attract into and retain talent in the service\u2014especially from among our best and brightest.\r\nI know you are as concerned as I am about our people\u2019s perception of the judiciary. I have said it before and I say it to you again. I have no doubt the majority of our judges are as honest, hardworking, and dedicated as they have solemnly sworn to be. But we cannot permit the erosion of people\u2019s faith in the judiciary, which is the indispensable third pillar in our democratic system of government.\r\nThe most urgent problem is how to deal with our clogged dockets, with over 300,000 undecided cases in our Regional Trial Courts alone.\r\nAnd so, instead of just blaming our judges for the delay, let us find practical ways of helping them along. Thus, I urge the passage of laws which will relieve the Supreme Court of the burden of reviewing decisions of certain administrative agencies. Likewise, the jurisdiction of the municipal trial courts can be broadened. And we should also strengthen the barangay justice system and pass the Legal Education Reform bill and the proposal for an academy for judges and prosecutors.\r\nThe establishment of this academy is part of our program of professionalizing our prosecution service. One must now pass a qualifying examination as part of the requirements for entry into the national prosecution service. The performance of our prosecutors\u2019 field offices is now monitored and evaluated on a quarterly basis.\r\nFor a more focused rehabilitation of our prisoners, we are now reviewing a program to regionalize our prison system, which will also free a vast and valuable asset in Muntinlupa.\r\nThe improvement of administration at national level must be matched by a similar advance in local government administration.\r\nThe expectations are high in our local communities because more resources, powers and responsibilities have been devolved to local governments. But the objectives of the Local Government Code of 1991 will be realized only with the proper use of these powers by local authorities.\r\nWe need to correct the law so that the mismatches in internal revenue allocations and the cost of devolved functions, which have disadvantaged some local government units, will be solved.\r\nEffective governance will depend on the harmony of actions between national and local governments as well as among local governments themselves. Inconsistencies in their respective areas will disrupt day to day affairs of commerce and economic life. Devolved powers have to be exercised judiciously without conflict with national policies. And the use of resources has to be subject to the same discipline of prudence and accountability. The national government will extend assistance in enhancing the management capabilities of local authorities.\r\nDevelopment is impossible if it is not people-powered and people-centered. Whenever foreign observers look at our country, their principal wonder is how we have managed to languish in underdevelopment in spite of our tremendous human resources, especially our labor force\u2014their literacy, their competence, their resourcefulness, their high sense of moral values.\r\nIt is time we fully harnessed this precious asset to bring about greater productivity and social cohesion.\r\nWe have embarked on a clear population policy that recognizes the need to moderate our population growth rate. At 2.3%, it is the highest in our part of the world. This rate of growth impairs our capability to improve our quality of life. It strains both our natural environment and our resources for providing jobs, education, housing, health, and other social services.\r\nGovernment has committed itself squarely to a family planning program based on choice\u2014and with the goal of bringing down the growth rate to under 2% by 1998.\r\nFor this, education and advocacy are our principal tools. And we look to partnership with the private sector and nongovernment organizations in reaching out to our people.\r\nWe must achieve an appropriate growth and distribution of our population consistent with sustainable development. We must reduce\u2014and eventually reverse\u2014migration into cities and uplands and thereby check the congestion in our major urban centers and environmental degradation in our uplands.\r\nEnsuring full and unimpeded access by all to both primary and secondary schools is the most effective way of empowering ordinary people.\r\nEducation reform must also develop a curriculum strong in science, mathematics, and languages. It must include the enhancement of the conditions of teachers\u2014in both their livelihood and their work.\r\nVocational education and technical training should keep to their basic purpose, which is to prepare young people for worthwhile jobs, and to teach new technologies that our economy needs.\r\nCollege- and university-level education should focus on developing competent professionals and on nurturing a culture of scientific excellence.\r\nWe will expand the public school network to the rural barangays which are still without public elementary schools, and all municipalities still without any high school, public or private.\r\nAll these require fundamental reorientation of our values and a continuing review of our education and training policies.\r\nOf all government public services, we have reason to be proud of our National Health Care Program. For several years now, health care stood high in our people\u2019s esteem because service delivery is sustained and dedicated. We have moved to improve these services further.\r\nIn particular, government has implemented new policies and programs to increase life expectancy by extensive immunization, improved nutrition, and environmental sanitation.\r\nWe look at the housing problem not only as an opportunity to propel economic activity but more as a challenge to alleviate the sad plight of our people in our slum dwellings.\r\nThe challenge is to ensure continued investments in low-cost housing through stable financing and by devising new and imaginative arrangements that will maximize the private sector\u2019s role.\r\nI will certify to Congress a bill that makes contributions to Pag-IBIG mandatory beyond a certain salary ceiling and taps other sources for socialized housing. This will help raise funds for the housing effort.\r\nIn foreign relations, we too, are striking out in new directions.\r\nThe visits I have been making to our neighbors are meant to signal the priority we are giving to ASEAN and the larger Asia-Pacific region.\r\nWith the United States, we are entering a new era based on partnership and cooperation\u2014while further strengthening our relationships with Europe and the countries of the Middle East.\r\nNow more than ever, we must place our diplomacy in the service of our economy and our external security.\r\nOur foreign missions have focused on attracting investments, developing export markets, promoting tourism; gathering economic information, and facilitating the inflow of development aid.\r\nIn cooperation with our partners in ASEAN, we are promoting confidence-building measures among the claimants to the disputed areas of the South China Sea. And we are taking part in our cooperative arrangements to advance regional security.\r\nIn addition to our preferential trade arrangements, we in ASEAN have also come together to give our six countries the economic weight, the cultural variety, the talent pool, the technological resilience, and the attractiveness to investors that we need to become a major player in the world.\r\nThe central thrust of all our programs is the alleviation of poverty. We must fight poverty in ways that will not merely wait for the economy to develop.\r\nWe must make sure that growth is broad-based and socially equitable\u2014that growth leaves no social group behind.\r\nParticularly vulnerable are our marginalized sectors\u2014subsistence farmers and agricultural workers, marginal fishermen, cultural communities, the elderly, the disabled, the street children, the urban underclass of unskilled workers, squatters, and their families.\r\nThe economy\u2019s return to growth shall by itself help ease poverty. But we shall also be needing focused, targeted, and specific safety nets for these vulnerable groups. We are therefore partial to policies and programs that encourage community organizing to attain self-reliance for the poor communities. And we will match their self-organizing initiatives with more social expenditures, food and education subsidies, rural credit, and livelihood programs.\r\nAll of these we should do. We cannot leave our poor to wait for the benefits from economic growth to trickle down to where they are.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of Congress:\r\nIn closing, let me declare that I do believe we have started creating the conditions for self-sustaining growth. We can end once and for all, by our cooperative efforts, the cycles of boom and bust which have characterized our economic performance.\r\nBut this much we must realize: reform will not come easy. Some reforms may bring difficult adjustments and even hardships before they do any good. The most we can do is to ensure that reforms hurt least our most vulnerable social groups.\r\nThe ultimate truth is that we cannot afford to fail\u2014in our venture of reform and development. The consequences of failure will be grave.\r\nRadical insurgency should never flare up all over again: These last 18 years, it has already cost us 40,000 dead.\r\nThe roots of Philippine rebellion lie deeply buried in the poverty, inequality, and injustice of our social system; in the inefficiency, corruption, indifference, and arrogance of those in power. Again and again, the violence of rebellion has broken out\u2014in leftist insurgencies, military mutinies, and separatist movements. We cannot keep using force and violence to suppress these outbreaks. We must try to recognize their root causes so that we can apply lasting solutions. To do that, we must understand how far rebels are motivated by people\u2019s frustrations over their inability to break through the barriers and patterns of oligarchic power that control their lives.\r\nOnly then can we redress, once and for all, the imbalance in national society between the few who are rich and the many who are poor. Only then can we make economic growth meaningful to the masses of our people.\r\nWe are at a critical hour in our life as a nation. Depending on how we act, our country shall either prosper or falter. Depending on how well we match our words with deeds, our nation shall enter into its second century dragged down by crisis and factionalism\u2014or raised by achievement and pride.\r\nOur history teaches us that the exercise of power must be guided by principle. For power exercised without principle is ruthless, and principle without the exercise of power cannot move our nation forward.\r\nMga mahal na kababayan, sa tulong at gabay ng ating Panginoon, magsimula na tayong kumilos upang harapin ang dakilang kapalaran na ating inaasam.\r\nInvoking God\u2019s blessings, let us move forward and fulfill our destiny.\r\nMabuhay ang \u201cPhilippines 2000!!!\u201d\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas\u00a0!!!\r\nMaraming salamat sa inyong lahat.", "title": "Let\u2019s Seize the Moment!"},

Ramos", "text": "[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 25, 1994]\r\nSa nakalipas na dalawang taon, malayo na ang ating narating\u2014na magkasama\u2014tungo sa ating nagkakaisang pangarap na mabuting buhay para sa lahat ng mga Pilipino sa pagsapit ng ika-dalawampu\u2019t isang siglo. Ang unang taon ay iniukol natin sa pagsasaayos ng ating kabahayan\u2014ang pagbabalik ng katatagang pampulitika, pagpapalaganap ng pambansang pagkakaisa, at pagpapalakas ng panlipunang pagsasama-sama\u2014na kinakailangan ng pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya. Ang pangalawang taon ay iniukol natin sa pagluluwag ng ekonomiya\u2014pagbubukas nito sa tunggalian, ang pagbibigay ng pantay-pantay na pagkakataon sa mga kalahok sa ating ekonomiya.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress:\r\nOver these two years, we have come a long way\u2014together\u2014towards our shared vision of a better life for Filipinos as we enter the 21st century. The first year we devoted to putting our house in order\u2014to restoring political stability, enhancing national unity, and strengthening social cohesion\u2014as the requisites for economic recovery. The second we devoted to liberalizing the economy\u2014opening it to competition, and leveling the playing field of enterprise. Already we are beginning to enjoy the modest fruits of these first reforms.\r\nIf we began under a smog of skepticism, we have proved to ourselves how much we can do\u2014if only we put our act together and pulled as a national team. Now that we have met our minimum goals, we can look beyond economic growth to the full modernization of our country. Laying the groundwork for modernizing our economy and our political system is the central task of this government and this Congress. And our end-goal must be to secure social equity for the poorest among us, particularly the basic humanities of life: to enable every single Filipino to develop his or her capabilities to their farthest limits.\r\nThe record of those first two years is appended to this report, which I submit for the Congressional record. Let me sum up its highlights before I move on to our legislative program for this Third session. First, political stability. To restore civic order was our most pressing commitment. That commitment you and I have redeemed. Armed with reason and goodwill, we are well on our way to a lasting and honorable peace with dissidents and insurgents. All-out war we reserve for criminals, terrorists, and plunderers. We have broken the back of the biggest crime syndicates, dismantled the most notorious armed groups, and effected changes in the leadership and chain of command of our police force to improve its credibility and efficiency. We will not consider this work done until every citizen can feel reasonably safe\u2014at home, in the workplace, and on the streets. Second, the economy. We have begun dismantling the mechanisms of protection and privilege which have hobbled our economy these past 30 years, while also focusing it on exports and global competitiveness. The country now feels a surge towards growth that is fully supported by such indicators as low interest rates, single-digit inflation, a stable peso, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, rising investments, and the vigorous development of growth centers nationwide. Our GNP grew at the rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 1994, and we are confident it will hit 5% this year.\r\nThanks to the statesmanship of this legislature, we in the executive branch were able\u2014under a grant of temporary emergency powers\u2014to end last year\u2019s energy crisis. Through innovations like the \u201cbuild-operate-transfer\u201d [BOT] schemes, we are better able to rebuild our long-neglected infrastructure. We upgraded our science and technology manpower capability. By 1998, we shall produce around 3,000 competent scientists and engineers. We have also established two additional Philippine Science High Schools in Visayas and Mindanao. We will continue to fast-track the improvement of science and technology foundations of young Filipinos. Already these efforts have begun to pay off: not only in higher GNP growth and increased productive activities in the countryside, but\u2014what is more important\u2014in restoring to ordinary Filipinos the sense that life can truly become better, for themselves and their children. Third, the environment. Here our guiding principle is that future generations should not have to pay for the needs of the present. We intend to leave this Philippine spot on Earth cleaner and greener than we found it. Out of Smokey Mountain and Payatas\u2014notorious symbols of our environmental degradation\u2014will eventually rise new greenery, and new lives.\r\nFourth, social reform. In poverty alleviation, we have moved away from the old \u201ctrickle down\u201d policies to \u201cpositive bias\u201d for our poorest provinces and the numerous pockets of poverty that are to be found even in our richest cities. Our object is to help the poorest of our poor help themselves by expanding their access to health care, basic education, decent housing, credit, jobs; and by raising their productivity in their traditional occupations. The \u201cKabuhayan 2000\u201d program alone should create 2 million jobs all over the archipelago these next two years. In land reform, we shall have redistributed, by the end of this year, more than 800,000 hectares of land. That is as much as the previous administration distributed in six years, and 12 times the hectareage the Marcos regime distributed in 14 years. Fifth, the bureaucracy. In our efforts to streamline the civil service\u2014to improve the quality and speed up the delivery of public services\u2014we have started right at the top: in my own office.\r\nSixth, foreign relations. Our country\u2019s emergence from under America\u2019s wings has given us Filipinos the chance\u2014after centuries of colonial passiveness\u2014to make our own history. We are renewing and expanding our contacts and friendships\u2014in East Asia and North America\u2014so that we can once again become attractive to foreign investment, trade, and tourism. I shall be visiting Western Europe in September to promote our trade, tourism, and investment programs in the European Union. The message I carry wherever I travel abroad is clear and simple: The Philippines is back in business in the heart of the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. And we have committed ourselves unequivocably to ASEAN and its ideal of open regionalism. Together with our immediate neighbors and partners, we are building the regional architecture for our vision of a peaceful, neutral, and nuclear-free Southeast Asia.\r\nHow did we accomplish all of these things? We were able to do what we did\u2014not by emphasizing ideology, but by seeking consensus and taking actions. Not by setting people apart, but by bringing them together. Not by charisma, but by quiet competence and patience, patience, patience. The lesson to us is clear: Without hard work, there are no miracles. We must perform as we pray, and pray as we perform.\r\nEven as we consolidate our gains, we can now look toward the full modernization of our country. Three modernizations we must achieve: First, modernization of the economy\u2014increasing productivity and competitiveness. Second, modernization of our politics\u2014making people empowerment work in place of political patronage. Third, social reform\u2014modernization of the Filipino family and the national community. We must prepare our economy for the new trading order ordained by the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Our survival in the evolving World Trade Organization will depend on how competitive our export industries can become. In politics, our task is to raise the national capacity of the state. Power must come not from force but from legitimacy. People power must be put to work productively. This I have always believed: We can develop as a working democracy\u2014and not in spite of it. The electoral process we need to focus not on patronage and personalities but on public policies. And we must see to it every citizen develops as great a care for his civic duties as for his civic rights. In social reform, we must never forget we seek growth not for its own sake but only as a means to enlarge each citizen\u2019s enjoyment of the benefits of our democracy, because no amount of growth will mean anything\u2014unless it improves the lot of the common tao. The key reform is to give the ordinary Filipino an inherent stake in our system\u2014the chance to own and manage an honest livelihood and to win his own future.\r\nLet me now take up our tasks of modernization in more detail. The first modernization is that of the economy\u2014to make it more productive; to make it competitive in the world; and to make room for the small- and middle-sized industries which are the building blocks of economic democracy. Export orientation is the only way to self-sustaining growth in our time\u2014whose controlling element is an emergent global economy. In the first five months of this year, our exports reached $5 billion at a growth rate of 16.1%. This growth rate is expected to further increase in the years ahead. Protectionism for us had produced only retarded \u201cinfant industries\u201d and a generation of political entrepreneurs who fattened on unearned income from tariff barriers, tax holidays, import licenses, and behest loans. Thus, both self-interest and international commitments compel us to turn our economy outward\u2014toward participation in humankind\u2019s shared adventure of development.\r\nWe signed the Uruguay Round of Agreements to improve our market access to the rich countries and to qualify for special treatment in world trade. The reduction worldwide of both tariff and nontariff barriers should benefit initially our exports of agricultural products, as well as of textiles and garments. In return, we commit ourselves to bringing down in a calibrated manner the barriers we have set up against the import of specific agricultural and meat products.\r\nWe have taken the following initial steps to improve our export competitiveness:\r\nI have already reduced import duties on a long list of capital equipment our export industries need.\r\nAll the bills proposed by our cabinet clusters are listed in the annex to this address. Nearly half of them were previously certified as administration bills at the 1993-1994 session year. Others were agreed on at our first social pact of September 1993. I realize you may not have the time to decide on every one of them. We submit them all, nevertheless, as an indication of our priorities and concerns in the executive branch\u2014while also indicating the ones which are, in our view, most urgent. The Public Works Act and the anti-pilferage of electricity measure which are in bicameral conference committee should now be acted on including the Magna Carta for Exporters which was earlier passed by the House and now on second reading in the Senate. In agri-industrial development, we place the highest priority on the bill on high-value crops, the mining and environment codes, and the House bill awarding protection to the ancestral domains of our cultural communities. In other areas of the macroeconomy and finance, we propose various bills to simplify our tax and tariff structures, enhance the investment climate, encourage the flow of credit to our rural areas, and promote long-term savings.\r\nOur whole tariff structure, we mean to rationalize\u2014to remove distortions brought about by differentiated rates, which have worked only to protect inefficient industries and penalize exports. We will continue, if not accelerate, the program to reduce tariffs until these reach one uniform rate. Simplifying and bringing down the tariff level is the best way to stop smuggling and corruption at the Bureau of Customs. We also need to recast our laws on trusts, monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and combinations injurious to public welfare\u2014to restore competition where it has disappeared, and to preserve it where it still exists. In a word, we need to perpetuate competition as a system to regulate the economy and achieve global product quality. To carry on structural reforms, level the playing field, and dismantle monopolies and cartels, we seek the urgent passage of various bills. These include the anti-racketeering and anti-trust/anti-monopoly bills already with you.\r\nTo improve government\u2019s capability to provide adequate services and infrastructure for the economy, we seek an amendment to the Public Transport Service Law\u2014last revised in 1952\u2014to rid it of its restrictive regulatory framework and to foster a new competitiveness in our land, water, and air transport industries. Efficient transport must complement our breakthroughs in the telecom industry which has served to link our archipelago more closely by high-tech means. In energy development, we seek your authority to increase the capitalization of the National Electrification Administration [NEA], and develop geothermal energy fields. We must create indigenous power reserves to serve our expanding economy.\r\nThe second modernization is about politics and governance. Ultimately, modernization is about good government. If we are to improve the quality of our national life, we must first improve the quality of our governance. In our part of the world, the economic success of less-than-democratic societies is being used to cast doubt on the prospects of countries like ours, which seek to modernize as functional democracies. We have already given our reply to this false wisdom. But we cannot neglect the core of the authoritarian challenge. We must prove democratic government is not necessarily inefficient and ineffectual. We have gained much headway in preventing constitutional gridlock and in legislating reform. But we have not yet achieved the level of political will and national capacity that enable a nation to transform its dream of modernization into reality. The true measure of national capacity is neither the size of a country\u2019s army, nor the way power is centralized in one man or group of men. It is how effective political institutions are at solving problems, mediating conflicts, carrying out policies, and implementing programs for the people\u2019s welfare. To this end, we seek approval of bills to modernize the armed forces and the national police.\r\nIf, in the economy, we speak of the physical infrastructures for development, so in our political life, we must lay the administrative infrastructure for effective government. Of this infrastructure, no element is more important than the bureaucracy. Let me be the first to say it: We are not getting the full worth of every peso we spend on each government agency. But, then, we cannot make the bureaucracy do better just by scolding it\u2014as we are often inclined to do. Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: I ask you again: Give me the authority to reorganize the executive branch, or significant portions of it such as the Metro Manila Authority [MMA], so that it can become the efficient administrator of our public life that it is meant to be. I fully support our local government units [LGUs] in their untiring efforts to deliver basic services despite financial difficulties. We are committed to bring to completion and full implementation the Local Government Code of 1991. I shall certify as urgent the bill that intends to allocate internal revenues more equitably to LGUs.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Supreme Court for its statesman-like handling of recent \u201chot\u201d issues. Just as the country longs for administrative efficiency, so I feel it welcomes judicial statesmanship. We all know how major projects have escalated in costs\u2014or even abandoned\u2014because of lawsuits by rivals or critics. Judicial review of executive or legislative action is a basic legal and constitutional recourse. But the guiding principle for all\u2014the legislative, the judicial, and the executive branches\u2014should be to act expeditiously to avoid unwarranted delays which cost money and result in lost opportunities.\r\nStep by step, we can make government more and more effective. I commend to this Congress the electoral reforms proposed by the Commission on Elections [COMELEC]. Said electoral reforms seek to modernize the entire electoral process, to include extending the mechanisms for voting of those absent from their voting centers by availing of the new electronic technology to contain electoral fraud; to speed up voting, counting, and canvassing; and especially to severely punish election terrorism. Our democracy is far from perfect, but it works well enough for us to be able to move it away from the politics of patronage, guns, goons, and gold.\r\nThe third\u2014and most important\u2014modernization we must accomplish is to bridge the gap between the few who are well-to-do and the many who are poor. Equality cannot wait until after the economic pie has grown much bigger because gross inequality by itself enables the powerful few to override the interests of the powerless majority in the making of public policy. Contemporary history teaches us that, in countries with vast income inequalities (as in parts of Latin America), substantial growth can take place\u2014for prolonged periods\u2014without easing mass poverty or liberalizing the political system. In East Asia, by contrast, sustained economic growth was typically preceded by some social leveling\u2014through land reform, health care, and basic education\u2014which released people\u2019s energies for the national drive to development. Growth with equity is the kind of development to which we aspire.\r\nOur social reform agenda is a systematic, comprehensive, and coordinated package of initiatives that addresses the minimum basic needs of the Filipino poor. This agenda was defined not by government alone, but in consultation with the social sectors adversely affected. Our agenda has both a geographical and a sectoral focus. It zeroes in on our 19 poorest provinces, which have historically received less than their due in government attention.\r\nAng ating repormang panlipunan rin ay nakatuon para sa mga partikular na grupo ng mga mahihirap na mamamayan. Dahil sila ay hindi iisang uri, ang antas ng kanilang pangangailangan ay nagkakaiba rin. Kaya\u2019t ang mga tugon sa kanilang kalagayan ay dapat lamang na kaagad nilang madama at upang maging angkop ay maaaring magpamalas ng panibagong kakayahan. Ang aking tinutukoy ay ang mga magsasaka at iba pang manggagawa sa bukid, ang ating mga mangingisda, ang ating mga katutubong Pilipino, ang ating mga maralitang taga-lungsod, ang ating mga manggagawa na kulang sa pormal na kaalaman, mga kababaihan at iba pang sektor na nangangailangan ng tulong: mga kabataan, mga may kapansanan, mga matatanda, at mga biktima ng kalamidad.\r\nIt will also focus on specific groups of the Filipino poor. Because the Filipino poor are not homogeneous, the nature and degree of their needs are diverse. Thus, the solutions to their predicament must also be direct and creative. I refer to our landless farmers and rural workers; our coastal fishermen; our indigenous cultural communities; our urban poor; our unskilled workers, especially in the informal sector; and other disadvantaged groups: women, vulnerable young people, the disabled, the elderly, and victims of calamities.\r\nAfter consultations with all these sectors, we have determined the need for three basic types of intervention. The first is to give the poor access to quality basic services\u2014the very imperatives of survival for people living on the margin. The flagship programs under this agenda include socialized housing for the urban poor. The second is to give the poor better means to earn their own living. Priority programs under this agenda include intensified implementation of agrarian reform and a sustained \u201ccredit for the poor\u201d effort. The third major item on our social reform agenda is a package of programs that will enable ordinary Filipinos to take part effectively in decision-making processes that directly affect their interests and their welfare. This includes a comprehensive and integrated shelter and urban development financing act, the setting up of a national health insurance system and a policy for intelligent population management. This agenda shall encourage the formation of people\u2019s organizations, the strengthening of cooperatives, and the push to carry out local government code provisions on sectoral representation. It includes the grant of absentee voting rights to overseas workers.\r\nThe last item in my report to this Congress concerns the costs of modernization. The 1995 budget complements our objectives of consolidating our economic and political gains and deepening social reform. Our proposed expenditure of P384.7 billion is only 6.4% bigger than the budget you approved for 1994\u2014just about enough to account for inflation. Yet we propose to spend 14% more than we did last year for social services. We are increasing investments in our flagship infrastructure programs as well as in \u201chuman priorities\u201d\u2014primary health care, basic education, safe drinking water, environmental sanitation, as well as family planning and nutrition programs. We shall also be spreading safety nets for those social sectors disadvantaged by economic restructuring. Fully 27.8% of the new budget will be spent on social services. Our eventual target expenditure for these human priorities is 5% of GNP. From a crippling 42% of the whole budget in 1986, we expect debt service to drop to 28.7% in 1995. In spite of the Central Bank debt and the continued borrowings made by the National Power Corporation, we hope to bring down the public sector deficit from 2.2% to just 1% of GNP. This greatly reduced public sector deficit is possible because the proposed budget of the national government for 1995 which I am submitting today aims to generate a surplus of \u20b115.5 billion. Our children should not pay for what we now enjoy, rather, they should enjoy what we now pay for.\r\nWe are enforcing belt-tightening and rigid fiscal controls everywhere in the executive branch\u2014including our public corporations\u2014because we realize how precarious and fragile our economic recovery still is. You and I know development exacts a price\u2014which all those who seek it must pay. That price we Filipinos have paid only reluctantly. Our current tax effort\u201414.7% of GNP, compared to the 18% average for ASEAN countries (Malaysia is at 22%)\u2014is totally inadequate for paying the costs of development. In 1995, we intend to raise the tax effort to at least 17% of GNP. Without a stable revenue base, the Philippine state will remain weak and dependent. And for as long as our structural problems persist, we shall remain vulnerable to outside pressures and external political and economic shocks. You and I know there is no free lunch in the world out there\u2014just as there is no freedom for the weak. Taxes are a necessary burden citizens must carry, and the best that government can do is to see to it the burden falls heaviest on those who can best bear it. Yet this judicious spreading of the burden, government in our country has not even been able to ensure. The Filipino middle class\u2014and the poor\u2014actually bear disproportionately the burden of paying for public administration. And, ironically, it is also they who suffer most grievously from the lack of basic social services which has substantially resulted from the very high rate of tax evasion by the powerful and influential.\r\nThis government is sworn to simplify our tax system, broaden its base, lower its rate, and make it more progressive. The system we propose is also economically efficient\u2014and socially equitable. In the past, tax reform had largely been patchwork\u2014meant only to plug the perennial fiscal deficit. As we move towards the 21st century, we need to establish a progressive tax system capable of consistently meeting the costs of development and modernization. Government also owes conscientious taxpayers the duty of prosecuting tax frauds and tax evaders\u2014all those who seek a free ride on the public good without contributing to its provision. We will be especially severe on tax evasion by the powerful and the freeloaders\u2014and on corruption among our tax functionaries. In exchange for lower overall rates, we propose to minimize the discretion of taxpayers and tax examiners.\r\nThe newly expanded value-added tax is meant to be a vital part of our tax reform package. It is designed to be more equitable, and easier to enforce, compared to the complex of 73\u2014yes, 73\u2014sales taxes it replaces. Those who propose to \u201ckill VAT\u201d denounce it as unfair and unjust. But, from government\u2019s side of the fence, its main oppositors are mostly individuals of means who seek to evade their rightful share of the tax burden.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: How then should we resolve this dilemma of development\u2014of finding the money to invest in our country\u2019s future? We must first of all resist the populist pressures being generated within our paternalistic political culture which looks at government as the exclusive source of goodies in our society\u2014lest our representative system degenerate into what Peter Drucker calls \u201cthe pork-barrel state.\u201d Thus, I think we should all get together quietly\u2014you in Congress; we in the executive branch; with representatives of business and industry, the professions, labor, and the peasantry; as well as the churches, academe, media, nongovernment organizations [NGOs], people\u2019s organizations [POs], and consumers\u2014to reach a consensus on paying the unavoidable costs of development.\r\nI shall be calling a second social pact\u2014to bring together all those who oppose the expanded VAT law and those who are for it\u2014to discuss comprehensive and progressive tax reforms\u2014openly, frankly, and I hope, with civility\u2014so we can jointly agree on where the resources to pay for community development and nation building are to come from. Together let us explore every possibility of where to find this money\u2014whether by paring government to the bone, raising the penalties and punishments for tax evasion, privatizing public corporations and other assets, cutting your countryside development funds, or a combination of all these painful options\u2014but let us together find the money to pay our way to progress.\r\nNow to sum up: ladies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: These, then, are the civic tasks for which we need your expertise, your industry, and your dedication. Our end-goal must be to lay the groundwork for the Philippines to become a thoroughly modern country, at peace with itself and with its neighbors, and where the least among our people have the decent minimum of material goods to realize the full possibilities of their lives. For a brief period in the early 1950s, the Philippines was second only to Japan in the vigor of its economy. and at an earlier time\u2014now almost exactly a hundred years ago\u2014we Filipinos had also proclaimed East Asia\u2019s first Free Republic. Today we are struggling to catch up with our vigorous neighbors in economic and technological growth. But, perhaps, we are more than abreast of them in one key component of modernization. We Filipinos have already won our democratic revolution. History has made our culture of freedom proof against tyranny. Of course, freedom by itself does not bring about progress. But it provides the most enduring foundation stone for the good society we are trying to build\u2014for ourselves and for those who will come after us. To lay that foundation and to move the country forward to sustainable development are the primary goals of my government. We face this task with optimism\u2014confident we can bring the economy to takeoff, and complete a profound reform of the Philippine State\u2014raising its political will, increasing its national capacity, and strengthening its social cohesion\u2014before the dawn of the new century.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: These past two years we together have achieved a great deal\u2014in restoring political stability, in turning on the lights once again in our homes and factories, and in returning the economy to the path of growth. But surely, my beloved countrymen, our greatest achievement has been to restore our faith in ourselves, and in what we can do together as a national team. I have always believed we Filipinos are hardest on ourselves: We tend to dwell on our weaknesses, rather than build on our strengths. Perhaps it is because the kind of democracy we have known\u2014for the better part of this century\u2014has emphasized the individual over the community, private gain over the public good, and civic rights over civic duties. But, in truth, the concept of civic duty is the core of the historic tradition of democracy everywhere. If we as a nation are to endure, we must return to this self-discipline of democracy. As individuals and as a national community, we must embrace this principle of civic duty. Only by so doing can we attain the good society our revolutionary generation of a century ago had placed almost within our reach. The momentum of our economic takeoff must be fueled by every Filipino\u2019s ardent desire to see our beloved Philippines returned to her rightful place in the community of progressive nations by the time of the centennial of our independence in 1998. I like to believe these past two years have brought out the best in us. We refused to be intimidated by the power crisis, natural calamities, and new challenges. Instead, we drew on our deepest reserves of spiritual strength, not only to survive and get by, but also\u2014as I said two years ago\u2014to win the future. Finally, my beloved countrymen, the future is dawning upon us.\r\nNaniniwala ako na tayo ay nagpamalas ng ating kahusayan nitong dalawang taong nakaraan. Hindi tayo pumayag na humina ang ating loob dahil sa mga kagipitang ating dinanas\u2014sa kakulangan ng kuryente, sa mga kalamidad, at mga bagong hamon. Sa halip ay humugot tayo mula sa nakalaan nating lakas na espiritwal, hindi lamang upang tayo ay makalampas sa kahirapan kung hindi\u2014tulad ng sinabi ko noon\u2014upang makamit natin ang magandang kinabukasan. Sa wakas, mga minamahal kong kababayan, ang magandang bukas na yaon ay unti-unting sumusikat na sa ating bayan.\r\nMabuhay ang Pilipinas!\r\nSalamat sa inyong lahat.", "title": "From Growth to Modernization"},

Aquino", "text": "VIDEO:\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKWc1xHmB0M[/youtube]\r\nFULL TRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 25, 1988]\r\nMr. President of the Senate; Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives; members of both Houses of Congress; the Vice President and members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:\r\nIn fulfillment of my pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution, I stood here last year and divested myself of the power and authority to govern this nation single-handedly. The act seemed premature to many. We had only finished lay\u00ading the groundwork for recovery. The objectives of our poli\u00adcies had yet to be achieved; their real consequences could not be known. We had done more clearing of the rubble than building on the ruins.\r\nWe had freed the spirit of enterprise which has accounted, far more than the direction of government, for the progress of our neighbors.\r\nWe had laid with speed and care, the foundations for a stronger and broader-based democracy. We had applied the first measures for the resurrection of a virtually dead econ\u00adomy.\r\nMemory will bring more vividly to mind than a recitation of statistics the devastation of our country then, the deep and sweeping poverty of the great mass of the people, the trauma of a wounded nation.\r\nMany said it was not the time for divided counsel and shared government. It was too soon to venture into the world without the protection of the extraordinary powers I had inherited, and which I had sparingly used to steer the nation to that first day of full democracy: the inauguration of the Congress of the Philippines.\r\nI ignored these counsels of fear.\r\nIt could never be too soon for democracy. I was almost proved wrong.\r\nOne month after I stood here and sounded a call for unity, the Right made its boldest and bloodiest move against the new democracy. With characteristic treachery, it lunged in the middle of the night at the heart of the Republic. While the attack was repulsed, the August 28 coup attempt almost wiped out the hard-won gains of a whole year and revived the nagging doubt that this country could have any future other than turmoil.\r\nI called on the people to gather the scattered stones of the edifice and build anew.\r\nDespite the great losses sustained, I felt no regret that we had completely restored democracy. For I had not been called to power to achieve economic progress at the cost of the ideals of the revolution that swept me into office.\r\nMy mandate was not just to make a country rich, but to make democracy work: to make it work as a system of genu\u00adine popular participation; to make it meaningful to the lives of the common people by giving them jobs and justice, work with dignity, health, and education, and reason to hope that the future will be better for themselves and their children.\r\nI believed that nowhere could you find more effective cures for the ills of our country\u2014such as the habit of oppres\u00adsion, the inclination to corruption, betrayal of the public interest\u2014than in the blessings of democracy: freedom; rights; transparent dealings; and a government of the people by the people themselves.\r\nDespite the difficulties of democracy, we would bring to the prosperous state we sought, the freedom and dignity with which we had started on February 25, 1986.\r\nHow well we have succeeded, it is my distinct pleasure and pride to report. How far we have fallen short of our needs, it is our unavoidable duty to acknowledge and rectify.\r\nNo one can deny the obvious: The economy has taken off.\r\nThe economic indicators show it; the general feeling confirms it. The economy is on the move\u2014not fitfully anymore but in firm strides on the path of sustainable growth.\r\nGNP grew by 5.7% in 1987; by 7.6% in the first quarter of 1988. The source of this growth, on the sup\u00adply side, was increased industrial activity; on the demand side, by vastly increased consumer spending. The industrial sector grew by 8% in 1987; by another 9.7% in the first quarter of 1988. Manufacturing posted the highest growth since 1981, mainly in electronics and garments. The steep rise in primary energy consumption confirms the dramatic increase in economic activities. Oil consumption grew by 15.8%, and by an additional 9.2% this year. Our energy capa\u00adbilities have begun to feel the strain\u2014a sure sign of increased economic energy.\r\nUnemployment dropped from 11.1% in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 9.5% in one year. One million six hundred thousand jobs had been created in 1987; well over a million of them generated by the private economy.\r\nWe have tracked this growth and found it accounted for mainly by small and medium businesses and by Filipino-\u00adChinese entrepreneurs, sectors that made few demands on the public sector, other than to be left alone to work in the democratic economic space we have created. We are seeing people\u00ad-powered capitalism in action.\r\nUnavoidably, growth exacted the price of inflation, which grew from 6.9% in 1986 to 7.4% at the end, of 1987. But even these figures compare quite favorably with a peak of 64% inflation in the last years of the dictatorship, when workers\u2019 real wages plunged. In sharp con\u00adtrast, improvements in real wages in the past two years have enabled the working classes to cope with it. In manufacturing, workers\u2019 compensation increased by 21%; minimum wages of nonplantation workers\u2014the poorest\u2014by 23.2%. Real wages of government employees increased by 11.2%.\r\nWe do not gloss over the fact that the number of unem\u00adployed who do not partake of these gains remains significant. Still, the improvement has been marked enough to explain the drop in the number of strikes since October last year. This confirms our belief that only economic progress can pro\u00adduce enduring harmony in the workplace. The relative self\u00ad-restraint exercised by the labor sector in allowing the econo\u00admic recovery to proceed with a minimum of disruption under\u00adscores the maturity, wisdom, and patriotism of the working classes and their leaders.\r\nWe lowered the duty on crude, and revised taxes on petro\u00adleum products. We rolled back prices four times. And there are at present ongoing studies which we hope will result in a future reduction of the prices of petroleum products, particularly of kerosene, diesel, and LPG, on which the greater mass of our people depend.\r\nTo keep energy supply in step with the demands of eco\u00adnomic growth, we have put energy development among our highest priorities. I shall set up an energy coordinating coun\u00adcil, composed of the Executive Secretary and the heads of the National Power Corporation, the Office of Energy Af\u00adfairs, the National Electrification Administration, and the Philippine National Oil Company, to keep track of develop\u00adments in this area. This should allay fears that we may outgrow our energy capabilities and choke the economic take\u00adoff.\r\nThe 1986 Tax Reform Program has apparently worked.\r\nThe increase of revenues from 10.6% to 12.2% of GNP reflects this.\r\nTo cut overhead and inject energy into the bureaucracy, I have directed Budget and Management to trim excess personnel from the head offices of the departments; at the very least to put a lid on new hires of overhead items.\r\nThe Privatization Program has generated P11.2 billion in gross revenues. The Program has proceeded less swiftly than interested parties may desire, but due care must be exercised in the disposition of assets that belong to the people. We must get the most we can for the people, in as fair and transparent a manner as possible, leaving no room for the smallest doubt about the integrity of the procedure and the people involved.\r\nIn spite of the clear guidelines I have set of transparency and open bidding, and against the urgent deadline for the privatization of certain major assets, some people still try to gain undue advantages. Let no one delude himself on that score. Those who fought with us in the campaign and revolution must remember that we fought to stop corruption of public officials and privileges to special friends. Let us not cash in on our patriotism in 1986. Let us rather be grateful to the nation and to the historical moment for the privilege we had of being heroes.\r\nLet me return to the measures taken to spur the growth of the economy.\r\nThe dramatic improvement in rural purchasing power was accounted for by the Community Employment and Develop\u00adment Program or the CEDP and, of course, by the unexpected improvement in copra prices. The regions are forging ahead. Three of them\u2014Region IV or Southern Tagalog, Region VII, the Central Visayas, and Region XI, Southern Mindanao\u2014\u00adgrew faster than Metro Manila. Their great potential is only waiting to be tapped by capital investments, such as roads and communications, and by the devolution of decision mak\u00ading to the local level.\r\nThus, we have decentralized the operations of the 16 major government departments, and increased private sector representation in regional and local development councils to one-fourth. Budgets are now released directly to local govern\u00adments and budget priorities are now determined in the first instance on the provincial level. An increase of revenue allot\u00adments and repeal of mandatory contributions by local units to the national government will place more resources at the disposal of the local governments.\r\nWe have given them, for the first time in history, the prin\u00adcipal initiative in the development of their communities.\r\nWe have marked out certain pilot provinces\u2014at present, Davao del Norte, Laguna, Negros Occidental, and Tarlac\u2014to which greater development efforts will be directed. The idea is to see what can be accomplished by an integrated and inten\u00adsive approach in a specified area, and apply the lessons learned to other provinces.\r\nGreat as our gains have been, we could have gone twice as fast and twice as far if we did not have one foot manacled to the debt.\r\nOur external debt burden must be dramatically reduced. On this I believe all Filipinos are united. It should be understood that we cannot indefinitely give more than 40% of the budget for total debt service. We estimate a net payment to creditors of around $12 billion over the next five years. This is intolerable for a country whose basic needs are as acute as ours. I hope that message is clearly heard.\r\nYet we understand the realities of power, the vulnerabili\u00adties of the underdeveloped, and the ways of international finance. Debtors with shorter tempers who had stormed out of negotiations have been forced to return to the table, their economies having cracked under the pressure of isolation from the international system.\r\nWe must grow, yet maintain access to the international financial system. We must find ways of funding our growth without being held hostage to our debt. If we are to meet our commitments to our creditors, the bankers must first meet our financing needs.\r\nOur debt strategy will be rooted in the recent recognition of industrial democracies that the management of the debt crisis is too important to be left to bankers. At the Toronto Summit, they singled out the Philippines as a country which needed support in its debt reduction efforts. Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita and U.S. President Reagan argued strongly for the extension of such support.\r\nThe world economy is held back by the debt that coun\u00adtries such as ours carry. In 1987 there was a negative outflow of $2.2 billion to our foreign creditors. It was blood from the veins of our economy, and took a heavy toll in missed output and lost employment. We need a transfusion to maintain our growth.\r\nThe international initiative for a consortium of donor countries to support Philippine development plans could give us that transfusion. I welcome the support of world leaders for the economic development assistance program for the Philippines. We see innovative and far-reaching debt reduc\u00adtion as a vital component of this international initiative.\r\nFew countries, if any, have hewed as faithfully to the con\u00additionalities of debt restructuring as the Philippines has. Our people have endured the most rigorous austerities, yet received no better treatment than those of countries that resisted. Yet, even as the realities of power force us to seek a just solution to the debt problem within the international financial system, those same realities may urge us someday to find that solu\u00adtion anywhere we can.\r\nThis has been a year of action on the foreign policy. In addition to hosting both the ASEAN Summit and the Newly Restored Democracies Conference, we have made state visits to China, Switzerland, Italy, and the Vatican. These trips have been part of an active process of strengthening and extending our international friendships. Our foreign policy should promote our assets in a way that strengthens us poli\u00adtically, economically, and in terms of our security. Through the two conferences held here, we furthered our goal of broadening our friendships and making common cause with those who share similar circumstances to ourselves. We are even now engaged in the periodic review of one of our oldest foreign policy commitments, our hosting of the U.S. military facilities on Philippine soil.\r\nThis may be remembered as the year the insurgency was broken. For the armed Left, it has been a year of defeats and retreats; a year of propaganda by terror rather than the stra\u00adtegic initiative of which it had boasted. The rejection of our peace efforts restored to government the moral basis for war.\r\nI wish we could still pursue the path of peace. Yet until the NPA and their friends come to trust their doctrines to the ballot box rather than the armalite, government has no choice except to defend our people with the gun.\r\nFive members of the CPP central committee have been captured, eight regional leaders, 19 staff officers and 397 NPA regulars. More than 7,000 regulars and tens of thousands of mass activists and supporters surrendered earlier to the National Reconciliation and Development Program and AFP special operations teams. About 2,000 of the CPP-NPA were killed in action over the last year.\r\nTo all of you in this chamber today who are here because you won at the ballot box, democracy is beating back the challenge of the totalitarian Left. We are winning because we have given back to the people control of their lives and faith in the future. To that renewed hope we add the fresh vigor of a new army for democracy. Above all, we now have a future.\r\nWith the victories come responsibilities. The first is to keep open the door of reconciliation. These are our brothers and sisters but for as long as fratricide must be a national policy, this nation cannot be whole.\r\nThe second responsibility is to ensure an adequate level of security to our people. This means our Armed Forces must be supplemented by unarmed Civilian Volunteer Organiza\u00adtions or Bantay Bayan, and Citizen Armed Force Geographic\u00adal Units. Our armies cannot be everywhere and be expected to achieve decisive victories. We need civilians to assist in defending their communities.\r\nYet they must do this with the same respect for human lives and disciplined restraint we expect of our soldiers in dealing with noncombatants. Let us not lose the moral edge in this conflict.\r\nThis morning I instructed the Chief of Staff to begin the process of disbanding all so-called vigilante groups in line with the Constitutional injunction against paramilitary groups. Every measure must be taken to protect the people\u2019s security against communist terrorism while the CVO or Bantay Bayan and CAFGU sys\u00adtems are put in place.\r\nOf equal importance as security against insurgent violence is protection against common criminality. From armed robbery to carnapping, our citizens live in intolerable uncertainty about the safety of their families and their properties. I ex\u00adpect the military and police to arrest, not abet, this slide into criminal anarchy taking place right under our noses. Targets will be set and I shall relieve those who fail to meet our peo\u00adple\u2019s expectations of peace and order.\r\nI am conscious that history will judge the achievements of this government and the usefulness of democracy not through the narrow perspective of the business centers in Manila, but by our success in making a better future for all Filipinos. It is in the fields and barrios, in the slums of our cities, that we will ultimately be judged. It is our duty as elected leaders of this nation to describe a vision of the future that lifts up the lives of this, the great mass of Filipinos: those whose voices are not raised in business councils, social hap\u00adpenings, and in the opinion pages of the newspapers.\r\nFor them we must build a future that is based not solely on issues of foreign affairs or the volatility of business confidence, however important. What is the good of international harmony if it does not put food in the mouths of hungry children? Of what value is a business confidence that is built on the suppression of the legitimate aspirations of the poor? Rather, we must have an action agenda that meets their ur\u00adgent needs in a simple and direct way.\r\nThat agenda is straightforward:\r\nOurs is renowned as the people-powered democracy. As we must live by the decisions of the people, we must ensure the quality of those decisions. Provision for education in the 1989 budget is increased by more than a third\u2014an essential investment in the future. Free high school education led to a record enrollment of 2.3 million students. Yet, we have far from achieved a universal education. Only 70% of our children attend elementary school; of these, only 60% complete it. Unless we act decisively now, we face a future of rampant functional illiteracy. Then we shall have people with\u00adout power.\r\nThis is the real national emergency, for what is involved here is not underutilized manufacturing capacity or insuffi\u00adcient incentives for the rich, but the very quality of the Fili\u00adpino who symbolizes the great Asian miracle: a revolution without blood; democratic restoration without tears.\r\nThe second priority is jobs. For this we must accelerate economic growth. We expect GNP to grow by 6.4%, and investments to pick up at a strong rate. The industrial sector is likely to grow 9% this year.\r\nCentral to our strategy for improving rural incomes is the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program whose highest aim, I must stress again, is not mere land redistribution, but higher productivity from the land and a higher standard of living for the farming communities that are the backbone of our nation.\r\nI signed into law the fruit of your long efforts, the Com\u00adprehensive Agrarian Reform Bill, reflecting your wide knowl\u00adedge and experience of conditions in the countryside.\r\nWe are increasing the expenditure for infrastructure by 50% percent, most of it to be poured into the countryside. We expect to double our spending on water supply. P1.3 billion has been budgeted for school houses.\r\nBy 1992 we intend that\r\nOur fight against poverty includes meeting basic needs like health care. We will intensify public health programs and pursue the various drug policies that will make essential drugs more accessible and affordable.\r\nWe must achieve a viable consensus on an authentic family welfare program that is responsive both to the Constitutional mandate and the challenge of a growing population.\r\nThe provision of basic services also includes making tele\u00adphones available to all communities. For a country separated by geography but driven by market forces, the social and eco\u00adnomic cost of poor communications is too high.\r\nWith your congressional leadership I have agreed on cer\u00adtain legislative priorities that reflect the national agenda I out\u00adlined today.\r\nOn the economic front, we must provide long delayed in\u00adcentives to the sectors that have powered our recovery, particularly the small and medium enterprises.\r\nOn the peace and order front, the urgency of a national civilian police force is obvious, and is high on your agenda as well, along with measures enhancing protection of human rights. Our other priorities are improved civil service effective\u00adness, education, population, social justice, the environment, the establishment of an independent central monetary au\u00adthority, and the issue of a metropolitan commission to assure basic services in the hub of economic activity in our country: Metro Manila.\r\nA more detailed list will be submitted. A common agenda should be easy to arrive at. What is more important is implementation of policy. The time for planning is over; the time for action is now. A lot has been done, but it has barely scratched the surface of the problems.\r\nAt the end of the year in which the middle class has be\u00adcome better off, I now say this to my department heads: Bring more of the new prosperity to the common people, produce concrete results on your department programs\u2014or you are out. [\r\n] Ours was a revolution for all Filipinos. Our poor have waited long enough. No sluggard will be allowed to stall the economic takeoff.\r\nLet me sum up:\r\nIt is liberty that has brought us progress; freedom that has generated growth. It is democratic space that has brought the insurgents down. But there is another side to freedom, where abuse displaces responsibility.\r\nWe have too often descended to mutual abuse, suspicion, and recrimination in our political life. Far from respecting each other\u2019s positions, we have been quick to question each other\u2019s motives, We are losing the trust that held us to\u00adgether and gave us the strength to prevail. We are forgetting that we stood together to win this freedom that is now too often demeaned. We must find again that trust and that strength, for the task is far from complete.\r\nThat trust comes from expecting the best of each other, and equally from giving our best. [\r\n] Across our country, millions of Filipinos are doing that everyday: giving the sweat of their brows and the strength of their arm, above all their ingenuity and energy, to make a better future for us all. Those who stand on the pinnacles of power should be shamed by the more earnest commitments of those who labor anonymously below.\r\nWe complain of a lack of national purpose, but if we are big enough in ourselves and in our dealings with each other, we will rediscover it in ourselves and our countrymen.\r\nIt was a year when we faltered in this search; when losing faith in ourselves we listened to others, whether to those who say our nationalism is flawed or those who take it upon them\u00adselves to instruct us that our future confidence as a nation rests entirely on whether we do, or do not, keep the Ameri\u00adcan facilities after 1991.\r\nOur nationalism should stand upon a larger ground than the hectareage of the bases; it should turn on something high\u00ader than the insults of short-time journalists.\r\nDo not let anyone dictate to us where our national pride should be. We know where it lies: in a sense of our past and a sense of our destiny; in the confidence of what we can make of this nation when we are united again by trust.\r\nWe saw what can be. A vision was born in EDSA. A vision of the future, of a people standing together, not just for four days on a highway, but on and on as a nation.\r\nNakita natin kung ano ang maaaring maganap. Isang lara\u00adwang diwa ang isinilang sa EDSA. Isang larawang diwa ng sam\u00adbayanang nagkabuklud-buklod na nanindigan, hindi lamang sa loob ng apat na araw sa isang karaniwang lansangan \u2026 kundi isang bansa \u2026\u00a0magpakailanman.\r\nMaraming salamat po.

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 1984]\r\n\r\nThank you very much, Mr. Speaker.\r\nMr. Speaker; Mr. Prime Minister; distinguished mem\u00adbers of this august Assembly, the First Batasang Pam\u00adbansa; ladies and gentlemen:\r\nTo this historic inauguration of this Parliament of the nation, I bring the hopes and prayers of our people that it will live up to its mighty charge.\r\nAll of us could wish that this moment might be marked in fitting celebration of its historic significance in the annals of our country. But we convene at a time of testing and challenge for the nation. Our agenda is long and will not wait on ceremony or ritual, and we could all wish too that as in times past I can report to you today on the health, the vigor, and the prosperity of our national life. But we meet today in quest of na\u00adtional recovery from crisis, of vitality in the face of adversity.\r\nWe can be proud and thankful that crisis has not found us prostrate and despairing, that adversity has not torn our society into islands of panic and fear, that pur\u00adposive work continues today to dam the tides of crisis in our midst and to secure the stability and confidence of the nation.\r\nBut clearly we have only moved past what could have been the eye of the storm. Its tailwinds still lash at us. And there is much rebuilding to be done.\r\nIn every time of ordeal for a nation, it is not so much the resources at its disposal, says the wise man, as it is the quality of leadership that finally decides the out\u00adcome.\r\nWe need such leadership now: the leadership of the members of the Batasang Pambansa; the leadership perhaps of the government and the party in power, as well as the leadership of the opposition party. Each has its own duties and responsibilities, its own cause to pursue and promote. But in the survival and growth of the nation, we are not rivals but partners. We are all partisans for a common cause.\r\nThis has been the way with us in every time of crisis and challenge for our country and our people.\r\nThrough all the mutations of political parties and creeds, we have always instinctively understood and recognized that while we are servants of our political allegiances, we are the nation\u2019s above all.\r\nSo let there be light and reason in our relations. Let us seek and find in creative debate and deliberation the way and the means to promote and advance together the national future.\r\nIn such a spirit of collaborative effort, the common burdens that we face today are less heavy than they seem. And the gains we have made by the midpoint of the years are touchstones perhaps for the vindication of our hopes.\r\nWe began the year embattled by the most severe eco\u00adnomic crisis to confront us since 1972. And this was quickly abetted by new restiveness in our political life and the resurgence of insurgency and rebellion in the country.\r\nBut we stand at midyear assured of the stability of our Republic, strengthened by the successful holding of a parliamentary election, and encouraged by the revival of demonstrated confidence in our country.\r\nThe prospects for national economic recovery were brightened somewhat by encouraging development abroad that suggested the beginning of a worldwide economic recovery.\r\nSustained levels of economic growth in many devel\u00adoped countries during the first semester of 1984, par\u00adticularly in the United States (7.9%) and in Japan (1.8%), are the first clear signs in years of a major economic turnabout. These have produced in turn new trade accommodations and improving terms of trade that were particularly welcome for the economies of developing nations.\r\nThe strategies, policies, and measures adopted in the national recovery effort have sought to maximize the effects of this economic recovery in the industrial world on the national economy, at the same time that aus\u00adterity measures sought to contain the country\u2019s balance of payments deficit.\r\nThese resulted in encouraging performance in some sectors of the economy.\r\nFor the first quarter of 1984, an actual surplus of $239 million was posted in the balance of payments position. When adjusted for arrearages in interest and other payments for the same period, a deficit of $155 million was incurred.\r\nFor the first five months of 1984, the value of ex\u00adports posted growth of 7.6% from $1,944 mil\u00adlion to $2,144 million.\r\nImports in contract declined by as much as 21% from $3,036 million to $2,399 million.\r\nIn agriculture, the grain situation improved during the first three months of the year as rice and corn produc\u00adtion increased by 1.5% and 10.5%, respec\u00adtively.\r\nMajor commercial crop production, however, par\u00adticularly of copra and coconut oil, experienced a reverse trend during the first quarter, notwithstanding favorable world market prices.\r\nThe average value of industrial production grew by about 30% from the same period last year, with the food manufacturing sector experiencing a 61% growth over the previous year.\r\nThe improvement in industrial production was accompanied by the reduced consumption of commer\u00adcial energy.\r\nIn investments, paid-up capital investments in the industry sector increased by 25.7%, pushed up mainly by the 150% growth of the mining and quarrying sector.\r\nThe favorable developments of the first semester, however, could not reverse the perceptible slowdown of the economy as a result of the economic crisis.\r\nA rise in consumer prices, which started in the last quarter of 1983, was notable during the first four months of 1984. This development was largely influ\u00adenced by successive foreign exchange adjustments and the continued speculations on the peso-dollar exchange rate. This was compounded by the reduced supply of imported inputs and the slowdown in production acti\u00advities.\r\nTo hold the line against inflation, the government implemented strict monitoring of prime commodities, and improvement in the marketing and distribution system to protect consumers from undue price increases and supply shortages.\r\nLikewise, the monetary authorities adopted restric\u00adtive measures to control liquidity expansion in order to contain its inflationary effects.\r\nAlong with inflation, unemployment was a major area of concern. The aggregate employment level reached 18.7 million as of the first quarter of 1984. This implies an increase in unemployment rate to 6.3% from only 5.9% for the comparable period last year.\r\nIn view of the unemployment situation, the emer\u00adgency unemployment assistance package was imple\u00admented full scale in early 1984. This provides for P300 million to be earmarked for unemployment assistance. Of this amount, some P50 million has already been released, with a total of P20.2 million already loaned out to laid-off workers.\r\nThe general slowdown in employment has scarcely affected, however, the movement of average income. The index of average earnings in key manufacturing enterprises rose by 23% for the first five months of 1984. This was a result of continued efforts to adjust the legislated minimum wage in response to changes in the cost of living. The minimum wages have already been adjusted twice this year for both nonagricultural and agricultural workers. Thus, the effective pay now stands at P51.92 and P50.83 for nonagricultural workers in Metro Manila and outside Metro Manila, respectively, and P42.40 and P32.00 for agricultural workers in plantation and nonplantation areas, respectively.\r\nThese developments at midyear reflect the impact of crisis and adversity in the economy and our people. They also show the measure of our response\u2014how resourceful, how courageous, and how resilient we can be in the face of crisis.\r\nBut the danger for us is not past. We have made only a start in the long road to economic recovery and sta\u00adbility.\r\nThe coming months and years will determine whether we can have development under the rigors of financial discipline and austerity, whether we can bring about not just temporary relief and stability but sustained and authentic economic recovery and growth.\r\nI come before you tonight to declare my faith that we have the fortitude, the resolve, and the imagination to meet this challenge. This calls for action on many fronts, but our main lines of action are the following:\r\nIn each of these areas of action, government shall forthwith ask the Batasan to pass the proper legislative action that will enable us to meet our targets and goals.\r\nOn financial stability which is first in our agenda, we shall continue on the course of fiscal and budgetary prudence; even the $67.5 billion budget which has been proposed for next year may have to be cut by several billions. Prudence designed to stabilize the balance of payments position will be followed to eliminate waste in government, to generate savings for productive and development activities, to strengthen comprehensive debt management, and to improve our tax administra\u00adtion and collection effort.\r\nTo develop and strengthen the financial system, we shall encourage bank mergers and consolidation, longer-\u00adterm spending, regional dispersal of financial institu\u00adtions; strengthen supervision and control of government financial institutions; and develop the capital market.\r\nLet there be no doubt about our commitment to help our financial institutions to strengthen themselves and stabilize their operation.\r\nI can report to you that during this period of un\u00adcertainty, the government has acted resolutely to assist many of these institutions in distress. These include organizations that are controlled by members or sympa\u00adthizers of the opposition. Our concern is for the whole of our financial system, and our commitment to streng\u00adthen it will be sustained.\r\nWe shall shift the emphasis in financing development efforts from foreign borrowings to domestic resource mobilization.\r\nIn support of this financial stabilization program, we shall seek from the Batasan legislation to strengthen comprehensive debt management, to tighten the coordi\u00adnation of government corporate activities, to strengthen the supervision and control of private financial insti\u00adtutions, and to improve tax administration and proce\u00addures.\r\nThe second line of action pertains to the restructuring of the external debt to lessen repayment burdens of the country.\r\nThe successful resolution of the financial program being negotiated with the International Monetary Fund and with private creditors will achieve two important aims: First, it will reschedule and restructure maturing foreign obligations; and second, it will provide the country with badly needed foreign exchange resources.\r\nTo make the restructuring program work for us, how\u00adever, we must impress and stress that every new inflow of financial assistance and trade credit facilities is uti\u00adlized to increase the country\u2019s capability to increase exports and reduce imports. This must be reinforced by a responsive and efficient domestic financial market.\r\nWe need, thirdly, to refocus our economic priorities in the light of new constraints. We must emphasize anew balanced agro-industrial development which pro\u00admotes the development of agriculture side by side with industry.\r\nLater this week or the following week, there will be submitted to you a national development plan which runs along this line.\r\nOur program recognizes the strategic role that agricul\u00adture must now play in the national recovery effort. We look towards increased agricultural productivity as the key to economic recovery and balanced agro-industrial development at this time when industry must undergo structural adjustments to reduce its import dependence.\r\nIn agriculture, sectoral reforms are now being imple\u00admented, and they focus on the gradual lifting of price ceilings and removal of market interventions which affect key commodities and agricultural inputs.\r\nSelf-sufficiency will be sought in various agricultural products, particularly the feed grains sector, where recent production statistics for yellow corn have been most impressive. We envision self-sufficiency and the end of corn imports by 1984, and exportable surpluses by 1987.\r\nIn support of balanced agro-industrial development, we shall now seek from the Batasan legislation to streng\u00adthen land use management and control to improve environmental protection, including conservation of natural resources, and to dismantle excessive regulations affecting various aspects of agricultural production, mar\u00adketing, and distribution.\r\nIn industry, the structural adjustment program for the economy will be intensified with emphasis on ex\u00adports development, progressive energy, self-reliance, industry dispersal, and tourism promotion. But we must develop world-competitive and agro-based industries and intensify selective imports substitution.\r\nWith economic recovery in the West on the upswing, we not only should expect improved export perform\u00adance; we should aggressively promote a production of nontraditional manufactured goods and agro-based exports.\r\nAs the contribution of domestic energy resources increases, the country\u2019s dependence on imported oil will drop to 50% by 1985 and further to 42% by 1987. On the other hand, our national electrification program will be pursued to raise electricity coverage to 62% of total rural households by 1987.\r\nAll these actions in agriculture and industry form part of our program for national productivity and self\u00ad-reliance.\r\nWe have initially set aside from national savings, with the condition that it does not increase our deficit, a total of about P500 million for our national productiv\u00adity program. Another P3 billion in savings and reserves and not from the deficits of the budget is earmarked for 1985.\r\nThe heart of this program connotes in essence a shift from import-dependent development strategy to indi\u00adgenous and locally based development. It accepts the challenge to the nation to look within for deliverance, to tap the energies of our own people for growth.\r\nIn support of economic efficiency and greater produc\u00adtivity, we shall seek from the Batasan legislation to over\u00adhaul economic incentive including fiscal privileges in order to reduce fiscal losses to the government and induce better performance.\r\nIn our productivity program, social equity is our essential objective. We can only develop as a nation to the extent that we invest in our youth and in the well\u00ad-being of our millions. No development can arise save from the talents, the energies, and the labors of our human resources.\r\nIndividual welfare and social services therefore form a major part of our updated development plan.\r\nFirst and foremost, we must and we will bring infla\u00adtion down. Greater productivity will be for naught if incomes are shrivelled by high prices. We expect to contain inflation at 25% by the end of the year, God willing. And in the succeeding years of the program, we shall be relentless in cutting it down.\r\nSecond, we shall do all to protect and promote the welfare and rights of labor, and ensure a climate of industrial peace.\r\nTowards this end, I believe, it is time to create some kind of a commission to look into the causes of labor and industrial disputes and recommend further measures for their prevention. I propose that the members of such a commission shall come from labor and management only so that government may play referee. These are the principal dramatis personae in the labor situation, and the government is willing to step aside for the nonce. I call upon this commission to likewise recommend the revision, repeal, amendment, and possible overhaul of our existing labor laws.\r\nThird, we shall strive for a more difficult delivery of social services to reach the nearest and the farthest regions of the country, and especially to alleviate the plight of the least advantaged.\r\nFinally, we shall work for the further reduction of our population growth rate. Before the year is over, it is estimated that we shall be 53.4 million people. In times of adversity like the present, there is need more than ever for the integration of population management and economic development efforts.\r\nIn support of social equity, we shall seek from the Batasan legislation for the implementation of urban land reform and for the clarification of the status of rent control. We shall welcome legislation and support aimed at fostering the well-being and morale of our workers.\r\nNext, we emphasize the high importance of an effec\u00adtive partnership between the government and the private sector in the recovery and productivity program.\r\nIn this spirit, I intend to create a national productiv\u00adity council which shall oversee the economic recovery and productivity effort, and in which we shall provide for representation of the private sector.\r\nIn the same spirit, to tap the full spectrum of advice and counsel in the economy, I shall form a council of economic advisers from among members of the private sector to complement the work of our council of eco\u00adnomic ministers, and to provide a second view of our economic directions and policies.\r\nI believe such a council of advisers will go far in enabling us to achieve a clearer perspective on our problems, our options, and our programs. And it is just possible that we can arrive through consultation and counsel at a broad consensus of economic purposes and goals that will contribute greatly to economic recovery and growth.\r\nAs important as government consultation with the many sectors of our society is the need to look into the health and vitality of our government machinery for the tasks of development administration. Our program seeks changes in outlook, commitment in men and institu\u00adtions. It is unthinkable that this should not begin in government itself.\r\nWe have referred in passing to fiscal measures designed to eliminate waste and fat in government. We go further to say that we require a more comprehensive line of action that will include not only this, but address as well the corrosive effects of graft in government service and the elimination of bottlenecks in government proce\u00addures and processes.\r\nIn support of these aims, we shall seek from the Ba\u00adtasan legislation to streamline government operations including the corporate sector, to upgrade the civil service, and to improve accountability in the exercise of public functions.\r\nAs we take purposive action to spur the economy to recovery and growth, we heed to ensure peace in our society and the security of our Republic.\r\nThis period of uncertainty and stress in national life has also been a time of intensive buildup of subversion and insurgency.\r\nThe peaceful pursuit of reforms including demonstra\u00adtions and protest is a necessary part, I presume, of our democratic life. But it is a very grave and disturbing trend when these are willfully infiltrated and manipu\u00adlated by subversives and provocateurs.\r\nLikewise, the efforts of labor to secure workers\u2019 rights and welfare have been marred often by subversive infiltration of their ranks. And these have led sometimes to violence at the picket lines.\r\nThe dangers on this end would not be disturbing but for the heightened activities of insurgent terrorists in recent months. For the combination of both\u2014intensi\u00adfied urban activity and countryside insurgency\u2014suggests an expansion of aims and a buildup of strength.\r\nThe gravity of these threats has therefore been met with the proper response by our government and mili\u00adtary forces. And you may be sure that we shall be vigi\u00adlant and resolute in our campaign to ensure the peace and security of the nation.\r\nIt is something else, however, to suggest that under these conditions the proclamation of martial law is im\u00adminent. I do not know how speculations about this started, but it is mortifying to note that these have reached supposedly enlightened sectors of our society.\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the situation is fully under control and does not approximate the situation in 1972. And even if the situation should deteriorate, we have adequate checks and responses in our system of government to cope with this, without having to repair to martial law. This is precisely what we had in mind when we sought to upgrade our laws for public order and security, and when we secured the authority of the President to issue certain decrees to meet emergencies. We wanted in short to calibrate our responses to every danger to civil peace and national security according to the extent of the danger and without recourse to martial law.\r\nOur political stability is proven. And work continues to refine and strengthen our mechanisms for political change and our institutions for democratic government.\r\nNowhere will this task be more advanced and met than in this Parliament of our people, where the system of contention and debate will exercise our political parties, and where new policies to promote political stability and change can be freely discussed.\r\nThere are no political issues in short that may not be reasonably debated and resolved here; no serious questions of national direction that Parliament may not justly consider.\r\nMuch discussion has exercised our political leaders and members of this august body concerning the authority of the President to legislate under Amendment No. 6, and about imagined rivalries that it supposedly introduces between the presidency and the Parliament.\r\nThis provision, Amendment No. 6 reads, and I quote:\r\nWhenever in the judgment of the President, there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the interim Batasang Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any reason that in his judgment requires immediate action, he may, in order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees, orders, or letters of instructions, which shall form part of the law of the land.\r\nIt will be noted that the President acts only, when, and I quote:\r\n\u2026 there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the Batasang Pambansa \u2026 fails or is unable to act \u2026\r\nThe exercise of these powers in times of emergency may be the more acceptable response to such a situation than the proclamation of martial law. Personally, I would prefer to exercise these powers under Amend\u00adment No. 6 to meet the times of grave emergency than to invoke the powers of martial law under the com\u00admander in chief provision. I have repeatedly stated in the past, and I say it again, that I will not take any action or employ this authority unless it is expressly demanded by the majority party in caucus in which are represented the majority members of this Assem\u00adbly, the governors and local executives belonging to the party, and the leaders thereof.\r\nI can assure the Batasang Pambansa that there is no intention here to replace the powers of this Assembly to legislate. [\r\n]\r\nI come to you also this afternoon to assure you that this power will not be invoked by me save in times of grave emergency or upon failure of this body to act, and only upon the recommendation of the majority party in party caucus. [\r\n]\r\nI shall look as our people will look to this Assembly for the action necessary to respond to the needs of the nation for both law and policy. We look for action now for that is what is needed to solve our problems.\r\nIn the systems and processes of our government and in the mandate we have both received from our people is the power to turn this time of challenge into a time of response. I have sought to describe here today the dimensions of the problems we face and I have pre\u00adsented to you the program of response that befits the hour and the need. We cannot confront these problems and take up this program divided in our counsels, con\u00adsumed by our hates and anger, and half-hearted in our labors for recovery and stability.\r\nTo the opposition members, I say you and I are Filipinos alike. The problems we face if not solved may well wipe out our future and our Republic, and in their stead may rise an alien face, a gruesome future in which neither you nor I will have a place. So let us suspend the petty political quarrels for today, the nitpicking and the fault-finding, and let us join hands to save our nation\u2014the Republic of the Philippines. [\r\n]\r\nLet me add another cautionary note. If our Republic falls it will not fall into our hands. It will fall into the hands of those who seek political power through the barrel of a gun. I know that some of our wide-eyed and innocent reformers seem to believe that they can use the subversive terrorists as their instrument to attain their end. But let us not be naive. Past and contemporary history belies this illusion.\r\nI appeal to the opposition now not to support the campaign of subversion and terror as a show of spite against me personally. [\r\n] If you have anger in your hearts against me, then let me suffer but do not let our people and our country suffer because of it. [\r\n]\r\nAnd like the good sons of a Republic, after we have saved our nation, after we have done all to keep it secure and stable, then there will be time enough for us to quarrel and match political strengths in accordance with our political processes. The opportunity will come soon enough for the local elections will be held in 1986 and the presidential elections in 1987. May the best man always win. [\r\n]\r\nI make this appeal although I am aware that the strength and stability of the Republic is fully capable of protecting itself and protecting us by force of arms if necessary, but with the help of God, not with the force of arms. If we have been pursuing a policy of \u201cmaxi\u00admum tolerance,\u201d it is because the danger has not yet affected, nor will it affect, the stability of the State. But there is a constitutional limit to legitimate dissent. Violence, subversion, and libel are not acceptable weapons of dissent in a democratic society, and let us know this from the beginning. [\r\n]\r\nAnd it will be considerable setback if after having elected and convened this Parliament of the people, we fail to utilize its strength and to ensure the survival and stability of the nation.\r\nThat is the challenge before this august body and the program of recovery is for everyone to make, not just for the government, the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, and the President to dictate but for everyone, especially the distinguished members of this Parliament whom I now congratulate for their victory in the last elections. [\r\n]\r\nLet us take up that challenge together, generous of each other, generous of our energies and our gifts, and in God\u2019s good time, I believe we will secure the blessing we invoke for both our nation and our people.\r\nTo each and every one of you, good luck and may God bless all of us.

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on January 17, 1983]\r\n\r\nMr. Prime Minister; Mr. Speaker; members of the Batasang Pambansa; gover\u00adnors; mayors; members of the Constitutional Conven\u00adtion; distinguished guests; members of the diplomatic corps and other foreign guests; my friends:\r\nThis is a day both of commemoration and commence\u00adment\u2014commemoration because we mark today Consti\u00adtution Day in our country and commencement because this Parliament of our people convenes for the first time in the New Year that is now upon us. In addition, this is the second year of the lifting of martial law.\r\nIn previous years, we have observed these landmark events separately. But today it is highly appropriate that we should mark them together, for this is a time to ad\u00address with candor and resolution the state of our national life.\r\nAll of us here today are profoundly conscious of the hard realities of the present.\r\nWe have come through a year of adversity in economic affairs, marked in the global sphere by pro\u00adlonged recession and crisis and which in turn have wrought their impact upon not only our nation but all other nations.\r\nWith the New Year barely a half-month old, already the prognosis for 1983 may be considered ambivalent. There may be no sudden turnaround, though many of us pray for global economic recovery. Once more, the year before us impels decision and fortitude to ride out possi\u00adble further difficulty and stress.\r\nIn such an anxious time as this for our country, it has always been the supreme policy of the national leadership to meet with realism and resolution the challenges to the nation.\r\nAlways we have looked at the reserves of stability and strength in our national life to prevail over crisis and chart our course towards the future. In this way, we have prevailed in many times of crisis for the nation, and rid\u00adden over the stresses irrevocably brought about by a troubled world.\r\nIn such a spirit on my part and on yours, we shall face the challenges of the present year.\r\nTimes of uncertainty can sometimes be the instrument to mold the fiber of a people\u2019s resolution and purpose. But they can also presage the erosion of will in national life, because all too often they breed a sense of helpless\u00adness and inertia and also because they are often the occa\u00adsions for the enemies of government to sow national con\u00adfusion and to debase the coin of national unity and pur\u00adpose.\r\nSo, first of all, let us see our problems for what they really are, and let us recognize those aspects of the na\u00adtional condition which cloud only our perspectives on the problems.\r\nOf late, we have heard here at home the drone of sometimes irrational criticism and abuse that feverishly tries to pass for criticism of national affairs. I do not mean the exercise of continued discussion and self \u00adexamination that should and must go on as part of democratic dialogue in a free society. Rather, I am talk\u00ading about the distemper, sometimes the malice, the slander, and the new bent of some to even denigrate or degrade the entire country and our people before the world.\r\nWe all know the reason for this distemper\u2015and that is the bitterness of those who sometimes in their lust for power forget that all of us must first start with love of country before anything else. Before they can attain power they must prove that more than anything else, it is our people and country first. Yes, I too have known the feeling of impotence and frustration, but for all their agitation, their nightmares remain their own.\r\nI have long ago learned to live with personal abuse by political partisans as part of their wages of leadership and politics. But I cannot help but be disturbed when such becomes the heaping of indignities not upon individual leaders alone but upon our people and the denigration of our independence and sovereignty.\r\nThis is criticism of the most contemptible kind, for which nothing is sacred, not even the worthy and the proud achievements of generations of our people in\u00adcluding those who offered love, honor, and life.\r\nLet me now say this to these dedicated opponents of the government.\r\nKung may nais kayong saktan, saktan ninyo ang inyong mga kalaban sa pulitika, sapagkat iyon naman ang dating gawa natin. Tayong lahat kung minsan ay nagma\u00admalabis sa ating salita. ngunit huwag nating ibuhos ang galit o di kaya\u2019y inggit sa ating kapwa mamamayan. Ibuhos natin sa ating kalaban. Huwag nating sirain ang ating sariling bansa. Saktan ninyo kaming namumuno sa ating pamahalaan, ngunit huwag namang ipahamak ang ating bansa. Huwag naman nating dungisan ang nagawa at natamo ng ating mga pangkaraniwang mamamayan. Hindi naman sila ang inyong kalaban. Wala naman silang pagkakasala sa inyo. Hindi ito makatutulong sa paghuhubog ng ating lipunan.\r\nNapupuna ko dito ang inggit at galit ng ilan sa ating mga kababayan na nasawi sa larangan ng pulitika. Ngunit bakit naman ito pagbabayaran ng ating buong \u00a0bansa ng kanyang karangalan?\r\nWe could, in reply to these alarms that our national energy is spent, quote the verdicts of so many interna\u00adtional organizations on the vigor and health of our national economy and the political stability of our government and organizations. But this would only be to fall back into other people\u2019s judgment of us, when in fact we must look to ourselves first and last to know whether we shall fail or prevail, decline, or prosper. In truth and in fact, nothing that the stranger or the alien says about us can help us if we really must fail.\r\nThis pandering to the smallest whim and caprice of the foreign observer says so much of why some countries can indeed be dominated by others, and why they often do not have the wherewithal to rise and help themselves.\r\nI say let us do away with these blinders on our perceptions of our national life. Let us see our conditions and our problems with our own eyes; for only in our self\u00ad-knowledge can we begin to surmount the uncertainties of the times.\r\nWhat do we know about ourselves and our nation to\u00adday? This is the question we should ask ourselves.\r\nWe know first of all that we are not the same nation that we were in 1965, in 1972. In 1972, this nation was almost brought down to its knees by the combined onslaught of social chaos, anarchy, and rebellion. Our polit\u00adical system, born in the midst of crisis, has proven resilient in the face of crisis after crisis since then.\r\nWe know that given the political will, we have it in us to mobilize our energies for the task of nation-building, and achieve development in our land.\r\nWe know that as a people we are not the indolent and deprived dependent subjects that colonizers once saw in us, or the credulous horde of citizens that politicians once sought to manipulate, but an authentic society of indivi\u00adduals capable of the highest achievements and worthy of the highest rewards.\r\nWe have discovered that our decade of experience in development has provided us deep reserves of strength to draw on.\r\nAll these underlie our economic performance in 1982, or for that matter, from 1972 to 1982. And I shall merely invite you to review the record in the printed version of my report which by now should have been distributed to you or will be distributed to you after my speech.\r\nIt will be seen from this review that in important and decisive ways, we have moderated the impact of global recession on the national economy, and that the fun\u00addamental strength of the economy had been proven solid and sound. By almost every indicator of economic health, performance and capability, I say, we have a sound economy.\r\nThe fundamentals are there for continued resiliency in the midst of economic adversity, and for accelerated development in the event of a more hospitable global economic environment.\r\nAnd it is to these that we must look in facing up to the uncertainties and omens of this year 1983.\r\nSo, what then is our agenda for the year 1983? We have reason to be optimistic.\r\nThe gross national product increased in 1982 by 10.4%, indicating that per capita income rose to 7.7% or an equivalent amount of P6,595. Inflation dropped to 8% in Metro Manila and 9.4% nationwide, whereas before it had gone to double-digit numbers.\r\nWe reduced government operating expenditures by 5.7% in 1981 and by 2.8% in 1982.\r\nIndustry falls at a 2.7% growth, while manufacturing expanded by 2.4% despite worldwide recession.\r\nIn agriculture we achieved higher yields in rice, corn, and other crops. We are presently prepared to export 400,000 metric tons of rice.\r\nIn agrarian reform we covered 680,000 hectares of rice and corn lands in Operation Land Transfer.\r\nThe KKK has benefited 194,000 persons all over the country.\r\nThe programs we have undertaken in energy develop\u00adment have reduced our dependence on imported oil from 95% of commercial energy requirements in 1973 to 68% today.\r\nThe housing program has made great strides. Pag-\u00adIBIG membership rose from 1.5 million in 1981 to 1.87 million in 1982.\r\nIn 1982 total revenues generated by the public sector were registered at P72.4 billion, indicating an increase of 14.4% from the 1981 level.\r\nOur international reserves by the end of 1982 stood at about $2 billion.\r\nBut for 1983, we can say there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cbuts\u201d to this prognosis that counsel prudence.\r\nThe recovery of the world economy will largely hinge on whether global interest rates will continue to go down. If not, high interest rates may again exert an adverse in\u00adfluence in the world capital market and affect all coun\u00adtries including ours.\r\nOur reaction to this uncertain prognosis for economic recovery is a continued exercise of political will in areas on which there is a possibility and leeway for such exer\u00adcise.\r\nIt is quite true that there are factors that adversely af\u00adfect our economy over which we have no control, but there may be and there should be areas on which decisive planning and the application of political will may bring about favorable returns, especially in the stimulation of economic activity, in the reduction of budgetary deficits, in the management of the balance of payments, in the improvement of the employment situation and overall welfare, and in the promotion of our access to markets throughout the world.\r\nSelf-reliance will be our watchword, even while we hope for global economic recovery to dispel the clouds of anxiety and uncertainty.\r\nThere are five key pillars and growth areas on which the economy can rely and on which we will therefore focus the thrust of economic effort. These are energy, agriculture, exports, heavy industries, and the KKK um\u00adbrella for small-scale and medium-scale cottage industries or the livelihood program which is the centerpiece.\r\nThe first of these pillars for economic development is the energy sector.\r\nNothing presents a more formidable challenge to our bid, and for that matter, the bid of any country in the world today that does not produce its own oil for economic development, than the meeting of the growing demands of our industry, commerce, transport, and households in the matter of energy. Upon this depends economic stability and growth, and for that matter, survival.\r\nIn this area where we have borne the full weight of crisis and hardships and remained vulnerable to shifts and changes in oil prices and supplies, we have begun paradoxically to reap the fruits of our massive and far\u00adsighted investments in energy development.\r\nAt the start of the program, our dependence on im\u00adported energy, as I have already stated, stood at 95% of the total requirement. Today it is reduced to 68%, and the chances of continued growth in domestic energy production are excellent.\r\nThe prudent and necessary course is for us to con\u00adtinue to pursue without letup our energy development program, by accelerating the development of indigenous and renewable sources of energy, by encouraging invest\u00adments in energy exploration and development, and by maximizing the productive utilization of energy supplies.\r\nAnd thus, you would notice that even while the First Lady was attending to her medical requirements in the United States, I assigned to her the mission to obtain the agreement of the new owner of Cities Services, Dr. Ar\u00admand Hammer, who came to the Philippines on a new oil exploration program in the country. We are of course in\u00adspired by the promise that the new owners of Cities Ser\u00advices will move forward towards greater efforts in oil ex\u00adploration.\r\nAt the same time we are moving towards the further development of our hydro resources and dendrothermal sources of energy. We have of course already exploited much of our volcanic steam sources of energy. We will continue to do so. We will need the support of the Batasang Pambansa in the effort to accelerate the energy program.\r\nThe second pillar for development is agriculture.\r\nOf all sectors in our economy, only agriculture has shown a steady growth rate of 4.9% in real terms over the last 10 years. And the principal growth area has been food production.\r\nBut we face serious deficiencies in several key areas, principally dairy products and animal feeds, including yellow corn and soya bean. We should now focus atten\u00adtion to these programs and support them with the needed budgetary funds.\r\nThe third pillar for growth is exports. Our policies and strategies in this area must now be modified to achieve greater market orientation for our products.\r\nIn order to survive in the highly competitive world market, we must specialize in and focus on products which we can produce quickly and more efficiently. We must also produce new lines of products that are less sub\u00adject to protectionist threats and other forms of market obstacles. We must take advantage of our smallness relative to total world trade\u2014an attribute that provides us greater flexibility in the choice of exportable goods, the ability to offer lower prices without significantly disturbing the prevailing higher world prices, and the pro\u00admise of gains in trade concessions since the cost of ac\u00adcommodating us relative to larger exporters would be or should be minimal.\r\nThe fourth pillar for growth is industry.\r\nAs I have said on many previous occasions, our aim is to attain a balanced agro-industrial development. The rapid strides we have made in agriculture leading to food sufficiency are now being matched by equally impressive gains in industry. Within industry itself, our aim is like\u00adwise its balanced development. The resources we have devoted to small- and medium-scale industries, principally through the Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran or the livelihood program, have increased dramatically in the last two years. On the other end of the spectrum, we con\u00adtinue to pursue with vigor the major industrial projects.\r\nDespite adverse economic conditions, we have been successful in initiating the implementation of 7 out of 11 major industrial projects without drawing funds from budgetary resources. And I would like to emphasize this, because we have heard criticisms from some sectors to the effect that we cannot afford these major industrial projects, since we are cutting down on budgetary ex\u00adpenses. We are not spending budgetary funds for these major industrial projects. Their production will pay for themselves. Neither are we paying the interest or amor\u00adtization for the loans on these projects from budgetary sources. All of these are covered by the program of in\u00addebtedness which our economic managers have been able to work out with the suppliers and the contractors.\r\nWe have been successful in attracting both the necessary equity investments and the long-term financing for these projects. As investors in these projects, we have attracted some of the largest corporations in the world, including IFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the World Bank.\r\nThe products that will come out of the major in\u00addustrial projects will cost very much less than imported products that we are now bringing in from other coun\u00adtries. An example would be the iron slabs. If produced from our integrated steel industry, iron slabs would cost $180 per ton; if imported, the same would cost $300 per ton.\r\nIn the process of saving foreign exchange to the tune of $400 million, we will at the same time be transferring technology and will be learning the most sophisticated art of industry, thus, laying the basis for a balanced agro-industrial economy.\r\nThe implementation of 7 out of the 11 proj\u00adects during these three years since we announced this program is no mean accomplishment. I have personally witnessed the progress of the construction of two of these projects in Isabel, Leyte\u2014the copper smelter and the fertilizer plant\u2014which together will account for over a billion dollars of exports from the Philippines, and I must say that I was very much impressed. I did not expect that these constructions and the structures that now exist could have been set up in so short a time.\r\nWith reference to the remaining four major industrial projects, despite periodic newspaper reports to the con\u00adtrary, I can confirm to you that we will continue with our determination to implement them provided, of course, as we have always said, that we are fully convinced that they are viable.\r\nNow, we have for the moment suspended the petro\u00adchemical project while we decide whether we should tie up with any of those oil-producing countries that are setting up their petrochemical complexes and offering equity to us. We have many choices and we should not lose our op\u00adtions.\r\nWith respect to aluminum, there are certain offers but we are taking our time so that we may suspend this for the time being while we develop energy sources because the aluminum project is energy-intensive. It might have to be tied up with the development of the Bislig Coal Ther\u00admal Plant in Mindanao, which is still in the drawing board and which is part of the negotiations between the Prime Minister of Canada and myself, and our Prime Minister during the last visit of Prime Minister Trudeau.\r\nFinally, there is a fifth pillar for growth\u2014our Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran\u2014which is our principal program to develop the small- and medium\u00ad-scale industries, to uplift the small people of our country, to stimulate livelihood generation not necessarily only in the urban areas but especially in the areas that have long been abandoned, and to recover from the trash can of our history and our past those that were forgotten and convert them into productive units of our society.\r\nThis year, the Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran shall assume a new thrust. It shall pursue the primary produc\u00adtion activities started in 1981 and 1982. But it shall also initiate new key programs utilizing our basic natural and human resources. I refer to the development of logged-\u00adover areas, which we estimate to be about 1 million hec\u00adtares and which shall be identified by the Ministry of Natural Resources. These areas shall be taken over either for industrial tree farming or for other KKK projects.\r\nThen, we have the acceleration of KKK processing centers, meaning the processing of products of the KKK so that they may be marketable not only here but abroad.\r\nThe public market program means the improvement of present marketing facilities. We have public markets but they are not utilized to the full. We must now im\u00adprove upon the public market system throughout the Philippines.\r\nThe \u201cmulti-commodity swap and offset\u201d arrange\u00adments will be developed and the participation of private financial institutions will be encouraged.\r\nOn these five key sectors, we shall focus the thrust of economic effort in 1983, for these are the areas in which growth can realistically be achieved, and from which will flow welfare and livelihood for our people and the broader development of society.\r\nWe will finance our development effort while conti\u00adnuing to exercise fiscal restraint and responsibility. Government will set the precedent in initiating cost-\u00adsaving measures designed to realize a reduction of the cash budgetary deficit.\r\nDuring the past three years when private investments were weak, the government bore the brunt of sustaining growth. What does this mean? This means that the govern\u00adment had to spend on areas where the private sector did not spend. This was done at the cost of soaring deficits. The limits are fast being reached so that even if we intend to maintain our countercyclical stance, the government could undertake the same at a slower pace in considera\u00adtion of restrained debt-servicing capacity.\r\nFortunately, a turnaround creates a favorable condi\u00adtion for private investments, thus exerting less pressure on the public sector to intervene. What this actually means is when the government spends less, then it leaves much of the credit that is available to the private sector, and therefore, we call upon the private sector to utilize this facility and opportunity in order that it may take over the slack that may arise out of government thriftiness.\r\nGovernment expenditures, therefore, will be prog\u00adrammed at manageable levels. The original obligation program will be trimmed down to P53.2 billion or 18.2% lower than what you and I approved in our ses\u00adsion.\r\nAlthough the world\u2019s economic prospects are forecast to improve during the year, the possibility of immediate relief should not be expected. Like the good soldier who goes to battle, we must prepare for the worst although we pray for the best.\r\nFor us, as a developing country, therefore, the main task of social and economic policy will be to defend jobs and incomes against any further ravages and to prepare our economy for the expected global rebound so that we can take full advantage of any rising demand for our pro\u00adducts in the world marketplace.\r\nThere are indications of increases in commodity prices. Coconut oil has increased from 18 to about 20-21 cents a pound. And copper was quoted the other day at 74 cents bounding up from 67 cents, and it is projected to reach $1 a pound in the middle or latter part of this year. The same thing is true with some of the other products. Gold sometimes reaches $500 an ounce.\r\nAnd on and on, but we can see some optimistic signs\u2014reasons for us to hope that 1983 will be much better. But we cannot depend upon such symptoms; we must continue to be frugal, to be tenaciously dedicated and devoted to the programs that we have prepared for this year. We will overcome these temporary adversities, how\u00adever, only when we act together, only when labor and management realize the need for cooperation and solidarity as the sole means by which both productive partners can survive these very hard times.\r\nI therefore appeal to both industry and labor to desist from acts that can only exacerbate the economic suffering of the majority of our people through reckless and thoughtless acts that affect our economic stability. I have no doubt that management and labor within their own groupings have their own politics, their own con\u00adflicts, and their own leadership and personality distur\u00adbances, and therefore, they try to outdo each other in demands and claims on government and on adversaries. The adversary relationship between labor and manage\u00adment should not be permitted to go out of bounds.\r\nOur concern for the welfare of the workers within the constraints of a less developed country is reflected in our labor policies that are considered highly advanced for a member of the developing world. Since the first oil crisis, we have raised legal minimum wages through 10 pres\u00adidential decrees and one presidential wage increase of P8 in the base year of 1972, and incomes have been protected against inflation.\r\nBut as important as industrial peace in promoting the cause of national development is the maintenance of peace, order, and security, which perhaps, above every\u00adthing else, is the first condition for economic enterprise and development of any kind.\r\nTimes of economic stress and anxiety are often the precursor of decline in the civility of social life and the rise of criminality in society. And just as often, they are the occasions on which insurgency and rebellion feed and gather momentum.\r\nWe have seen some evidences of this well-worn saw or saying. Effective response to this twin threat of criminali\u00adty and insurgency lies on the twin program of economic development and counterinsurgency. Foremost in our law enforcement efforts and in anti-insurgency campaign must still be the efficiency of the grievance machinery and justice for all including the smallest of the small, and at the same time, economic development that will touch the life of our common people.\r\nAlong this line, I have ordered the Philippine Con\u00adstabulary to now commence a program for the retraining of all its officers and men. Likewise, with a view to strengthening our law enforcement effort, I intend to create an integrity council for the police, following the completion of our judiciary reorganization.\r\nFinally, I would emphasize the importance that foreign affairs plays in the national development effort.\r\nThe world today will never be as it was before because of its interdependence from which there can be no escap\u00ading its pressures and influences. What happens elsewhere in the world inevitably affects us in one way or another, sooner or later. And nowhere is this more so than in the economic sphere, largely because foreign policy today is international trade policy. And foreign relations are a test of molding effective economic cooperation with other countries.\r\nSo, what is our legislative agenda for this year? Ac\u00adtion in these key areas of national concern, and on the scale and urgency required, is feasible under the system of government which we have evolved and enshrined in our Constitution.\r\nI come to you as the head of the party that controls the majority in the Batasang Pambansa, but still we de\u00adpend upon mutual consultation and consensus, and meet\u00ading with our people and feeling out their pulses. Actually, most of the role of leadership is feelings out the thoughts, the unexpressed feelings and desires of our people, and finally articulating them whether in legislation or orders and in plans and projects. These we must continue to do, for we now have the political mechanism for response to every stress in national life, be it in peace and security or in the economic and social frontiers. In this mechanism for effective and responsible government, the Batasang Pambansa is a cornerstone of governmental leadership and power. And I now urge this Assembly to use that authority to help meet the unprecedented tasks before us in its legislative agenda for the year, as follows:\r\nYou have pending before you on Third Reading the Local Government Code which is awaiting your action.\r\nThere are proposed amendments to the Election Code, some of which pertain to the recognition or certification of parties, turncoatism, and the like. The ques\u00adtion of the apportionment of seats cannot be postponed because elections are to be held next year.\r\nThen there are proposed amendments to the Invest\u00adments Act. We probably have to review many of the pro\u00advisions of this act.\r\nIn addition to these and other items in your legislative calendar, I now ask you to look into the policy that has been adopted by our Constitution which seems to have wiped out what was originally intended to help the poor acquire public land from government holdings. I refer to homestead, free hold, or to sales and other means of transfer of land.\r\nWe must now discuss the possibility of a constitu\u00adtional amendment pertaining to the alienation of public land. At present, the Constitution provides only for the lease of public lands, and as such does not allow for their long-term utilization by large-scale enterprise projects.\r\nLet us take, for example, a tree farm project for the dipterocarp, or say, tropical wood which may take 70 to a hundred years to grow. Can anybody now utilize any of these public lands for tree farming if under ex\u00adisting constitutional provisions the land can only be leased for 25 years, and extended for another 25 years?\r\nOf course, there are advantages and disadvantages with this, and we must look into them. In the light of our economic development objectives, we may have to con\u00adsider the use of such public lands for long-range econo\u00admic enterprise projects and allow their eventual sale again.\r\nAt the same time, we must solve the problem of the squatters in public lands by allowing small landowners to title the same. Under the existing provisions of the Con\u00adstitution, there is a legal obstacle to the titling by small landowners of public land. I submit this matter to you for study.\r\nOn the question of judicial reorganization, may I say that as vital as the fulfillment of your legislative agenda is the fulfillment of the letter and spirit of legislation that emanates from this body.\r\nToday, as a fitting celebration of Constitution Day, you shall bear witness to the signing and promulgation of what may be a monumental document, the executive order declaring the reorganization of the entire judiciary with the exception of the Sandiganbayan and the Supreme Court, as mandated by Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.\r\nThis executive order seeks to rectify the shortcomings of the past endeavors to institutionalize the achievements of the present, and embodies our hopes and optimism on a judicial structure that shall ever be responsive to the changing times and to the needs of our people. It shall sharpen the grievance machinery to meet the needs of our modern times.\r\nWith this Executive Order, I am initially appointing 34 appellate justices of the Intermediate Appellate Court, based on the recommendations of the Integrity Council and upon consultation with the Supreme Court and other sources like the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, as well as members of this august body and other leaders. I have decided to reappoint 23 incumbent justices of the Court of Appeals (which means that some of them had been removed) whom I believe are deserving of the privilege and the honor to continue serving the New Republic and the Filipino people.\r\nWe have introduced innovation in the structure of the new Intermediate Appellate Court, and this is specializa\u00adtion. I have kept this in mind in filling the positions of each specialized division by taking into consideration the qualifications, experience, and specialty of each ap\u00adpointee.\r\nOf the 720 positions of the judges of the regional trial courts created under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, I intend to fill only 618 salas in the meantime.\r\nTo the 339 incumbent judges of the old courts of first instance, I am constrained not to reappoint at least 32 after careful consideration of the recommendations of the Integrity Council which was created to review and screen not only the competence and qualifications but also the moral fitness of the incumbent judges.\r\nAt the same time, about 35 judges have been called to a hearing and their records and services scrutinized in their presence. Warnings have been issued to some, if not most of them.\r\nIn the National Capital Region, out of 172 positions of judges created under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, I in\u00adtend to fill 135 positions.\r\nUpon recommendations of the Integrity Council and after review of individual performances, and upon con\u00adsultation with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, I am reappointing 60 incumbents of the old courts of first instance in Metropolitan Manila. To the remaining 75 salas, upon recommendation again of the Integrity Coun\u00adcil and after consulting the Supreme Court\u2019s seniority listing of those who have served the judiciary more than 7 years or judges who have served less but have commend\u00adable service records (especially those who have been able to decide cases at the rate of more than 300 per month) I have decided to appoint, by way of promotion, 67 incum\u00adbent judges stationed in various provinces. To fill the remaining eight positions, I have made deserving choices from an array of distinguished and learned prosecutors and lawyers.\r\nThe new appointees to the Intermediate Appellate Court and the filling of 127 salas in Metro Manila from amongst the 399 incumbents is solid evidence that politics has not crept into the choice of appointments in the judiciary. We have listened to the recommendations of the members of the Batasan, the governors, the local ad\u00administrators, and everybody, including the clergy and the intelligence officers, but the final deciding point was merit and experience.\r\nWith this initial wave of appointments to the Inter\u00admediate Appellate Court of distinguished jurists and lawyers, I am confident that we are moving close to the attainment of the objectives of the Judiciary Reorganiza\u00adtion Act, which are to minimize the overload of about 450,000 cases and increase the efficiency and effective\u00adness of the courts to enhance the quality of justice ad\u00administration.\r\nIn your presence, therefore, I now sign this Executive Order which puts into effect this reorganization law as well as the interim Rules of Court, copies of which have been submitted to the Batasan and to me by the Su\u00adpreme Court of the Philippines.\r\nI therefore sign this Executive Order in your presence. [\r\n]\r\nAt the same time, you are well aware that we are ap\u00adproaching this matter of economic development in a more systematic manner by appointing area managers. The governors and mayors have met with the Cabinet and the Prime Minister, as well as with our various technocrats, in order that they may choose the area managers in their respective provinces. The listings have been submitted to me and the designations are therefore with me.\r\nI hereby announce and proclaim the effectivity of Ex\u00adecutive Order No. 803, which now establishes the \u201cArea Management System\u201d throughout the Philippines, and I hereby appoint the following as area managers through\u00adout the Philippines in accordance with the recommenda\u00adtions of the various provincial councils and economic development groups.\r\nIn your presence, I sign these appointments and this proclamation. [\r\n]\r\nMay I now conclude by saying that at no other time in the life of our new Constitution has there been more urgent need to realize its meaning and purposes in our deliberations and decision making.\r\nIf we review our journey during the last 10 years, we can say that one phase of national effort\u2014vital, dramatic, and crisis laden\u2014has come to a close. We have seen ourselves emerge from a long night of national travail, lived through an eight -and-a-half-year period of crisis government, and brought at its close the structure of our new Republic.\r\nNow we are into a new stage of national evolution where our new mechanisms of government and all the lessons we have learned from the last decade must now confront the challenges and promises of a new decade, a new age, a new time.\r\nWe look to the state of our nation today, and we are not dismayed but encouraged. We have exorcised the demons and the goblins of the past. We have confronted the ghosts which terrorize us in times of crises in dark of night and overcome them. We look to ourselves and what we have achieved and we are not ashamed, but proud.\r\nThose among us who can only view the adversities of today with sickly anxiety and defeatism only mark their isolation from the work which we have been engaged in. For is it not a fact that through all these years of trial and effort, these Cassandras of doom, small men of little faith, could only cavil while we worked, hard and desperately, prophesying our failure while we reaped suc\u00adcess, and could only lust for power while impotent to win the allegiance and the support of our countrymen?\r\nThe time is past for us to even deign to listen to these counsels.\r\nIn this solemn hour of challenge to our country, let us rather listen to the chords of memory and experience, which remind us of how step by step, year after year, trial after trial, we have built the sinews of this New Republic.\r\nLet us turn to the farmers in our fields who in their toil have raised the productivity of our farms and are changing the face of our countryside.\r\nLet us listen to the workers in our factories all over the land who have raised the productivity of our industries, and whose products today are being seen and bought in foreign lands.\r\nLet us listen to our people\u2014the teachers, the managers, the office workers, the public servants amongst us\u2014all who have exerted themselves, all within their modest domain, to contribute something, even if it be but small, of themselves to lift up their country and their people.\r\nLet us listen to the voice of our local communities to\u00adday, each of which is aware now of what is within its capacities to build and create, as all of them see life changing in their country, and they see a dawning, a bright new day.\r\nFor theirs are the myriad labors that are the nuts and bolts of nation building. And they constitute the authen\u00adtic voice of our nation today\u2014a voice to which we must pay heed in guiding the course of national life.\r\nSo much of democratic leadership finally and truly consists in understanding those people\u2019s needs and hopes, in giving due dignity and honor to their labors. No matter how much we may compete for political authority, we must recognize the labors of the ordinary common man. And so much of success in the exercise of authority rests on the ability to mobilize such needs, such hopes, such dreams, and such labors, into a single union of effort.\r\nAnd we in this Assembly are merely the instruments of our people\u2019s deepest wish to gather them together, to enable them to achieve the best that is in them, and to do all these for love of country and of the Republic, to make our nation strong, prosperous, and free.\r\nIn the spirit of that mandate, let us therefore go for\u00adward and lead. I am confident that you will.\r\nThank you and good day. [\r\n]", "title": "State-of-the-Nation Address"},

Aquino", "text": "VIDEO:\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slZ4Vql06Nw[/youtube]\r\nTRANSCRIPT:\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1987]\r\nMr. President of the Senate; Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives; members of both Houses of Congress; the Vice President and members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen:\r\nFifteen years ago, in this season of the year, my hus\u00adband stood in the Senate and delivered what turned out to be the valedictory of Philippine democracy. He exposed the conspiracy to place the country under martial law, dissolve the Congress, and set the stage for the unremitting plunder of our patrimony and the degradation of our great name and honor.\r\nThe dictatorship\u2019s last mockery of democracy was committed in this hall, where the loser was proclaimed winner of the snap election. Today, I join you in rededicat\u00ading this hall to true democracy. [\r\n]\r\nThe route to these chambers was long and difficult, fraught with danger and paved with sacrifice. The electoral contest just completed has been exacting for all and bitter for some. But the nation has spoken. The complete leader\u00adship of this country has been chosen; the configuration of their powers and duties permanently set by the new Constitution.\r\nAn election is as much an expression as it is an exer\u00adcise of the national will. We have been made instruments of this will. Our performance will bear witness to its wis\u00addom.\r\nIt is my duty under the Constitution to apprise you now of the state of the nation\u2014but henceforth its con\u00adtinuing progress shall be our common accountability.\r\nWhen I took power in this country 17 months ago, I was immediately called upon to deal with the dangerous combination of a severely distressed economy and a grow\u00ading insurgency; threats which fed on each other and on the hopelessness and confusion which prevailed. Production had contracted by 11% for two consecutive years, bringing unemployment rates to double-digit levels. Twelve percent of the labor force, nearly 2.6 million workers, were unemployed. (And up to now, 750,000 join the labor force every year.) Real per capita income had been set back 10 years. New investments had dried up and business con\u00adfidence was at an all-time low. Interest payments on a $26.3 billion external debt took almost half our export earnings. And as I must stress yet again, no part of this debt benefited, or perhaps was even seriously expected to bene\u00adfit the Filipino people. Yet their posterity to the third gene\u00adration and farther are expected to pay it.\r\nPoverty blighted the land. Five million families (or 59% of the total) lived below the poverty line, as com\u00adpared to 45% in 1971. Dictatorship had done nothing but make more of our people poorer.\r\nIt also made us sicker. The prevalence of malnutrition among our young and the incidence of birth fatalities had risen at alarming rates.\r\nIn short, I inherited an economy in shambles and a polity with no institutions save my presidency to serve as the cornerstone of the new democracy that we set out to build.\r\nI had taken the oath to be president of a country that had lost everything, everything but honor. With that honor came a renewed faith in national leadership and in the ability of our race to change things for the better given the will and the courage to do it. [\r\n]\r\nI responded with an economic reform program aimed at recovery in the short, and sustainable growth in the long run. More concretely, it addressed itself to the basic prob\u00adlems of unemployment and underemployment, and the consequent mass poverty.\r\nThe program calls for comprehensive structural reforms of the internal economy, complemented by no less im\u00adportant external economic cooperation.\r\nThere are two basic features of this program:\r\nThe first is its comprehensiveness with respect to structural reforms. We have come to regard the scope of reform not as a problem, but as a challenge, as necessary as it is ambitious; and as realizable as the strength of our commitment allows.\r\nThe second basic feature is its reliance on the private sector to carry the main burden of growth. We have re\u00adaffirmed our faith in private initiative to propel and sustain our economy. Our premise is that, for as long as free market forces dictate the dynamics of the business environment, the private sector will respond aggressively. As a corollary, the program defines and limits government\u2019s participation in the economy.\r\nThe dictatorship gave special privileges to government corporations and select individuals. In their various forms, these enterprises had several things in common: They en\u00adriched the few at the cost of impoverishing the many. They distorted markets and factors of production. And they bore the aspect of legitimacy that made challenge and change impossible.\r\nWe abolished these monopolies and special privileges and the effect was felt almost immediately. Fertilizer prices dropped 33% and farmgate prices of copra nearly doubled in 1986. We trace in part the renewed vigor in agriculture and the general economy to these and similar measures.\r\nWe committed ourselves to a fair and transparent trade liberalization program that is consistent with our country\u2019s continuing weaknesses. Some 1,000 items were released, from a complex bureaucracy of licensing re\u00adquirements, into a regime of rational tariff protection.\r\nWe removed price controls which had been an almost permanent fixture of the past regime. And yet inflation was less than 1% for the whole of 1986 and our estimates place it at an average of 1% for the first half of this year.\r\nWe instituted tax reforms to shelter the poor from onerous taxes and equitably redistribute the tax burden. We created an Asset Privatization Trust and a Committee on Privatization to start the divestiture of government control or participation in private business and, with the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority, the SADA, to help fund the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program that I enacted last week.\r\nRecession hit the international economy in the early eighties. Every economy suffered, but the heaviest toll was taken on the fragile economies of the developing nations. One of the worst hit was our own. The dictatorship had already borrowed heavily, exceeding the debt ceiling man\u00addated by law, when interest rates shot up. Meanwhile, a material portion of the debt had gone to projects that of\u00adfered virtually no hope of payback. Conceived to either line pockets or inflate egos, these projects would never contribute to the repayment of the debt.\r\nThe domestic structural reform program we have initiated cannot be pursued in earnest unless the necessary financing is made available. Fresh funding is needed to effect adjustments in the industrial structure, to assist new ventures, and to support our social programs. This funding cannot come from the domestic economy. Low domestic incomes cannot generate the required savings. Meanwhile, debt service was taking half our export earnings. Rescue could only come from foreign sources, both official and private.\r\nOur appeal for external economic cooperation was aimed at gaining increased flexibility in our domestic re\u00adsource management. The program required a reduction in our debt burden and increased support from bilateral and multilateral institutions. Simply put, we needed to buy time for our structural reforms to start paying dividends. And time is money. While a fool and his money are easily parted, we have discovered that our foreign creditors are not such great fools as the past leadership of our country.\r\nIt is my sad duty to report to you that the results of the recently concluded debt renegotiations are far short of our expectations and, more importantly, of our urgent needs. Let me put it bluntly. Our extraordinary achievement in fulfilling the first requirement of renegotiation, the estab\u00adlishment of free and responsible government, gained us applause but no substantial accommodation from our foreign creditors. The saga of democracy had made great television, but no appreciable change on their business priorities. We were treated not much better than other debtors, even those who had rejected the austere discipline mandated by re\u00adstructuring. A discipline we had readily accepted. Incredibly, despite the significant reduction in country risk effected by the democratic restoration, we were not accorded the terms given other countries, which got longer periods, better rates, and greater latitude for growth.\r\nWe cannot help but feel that our foreign creditors took undue and unfair advantage of the internal difficulties we have with factions intent on subverting this government and destroying our democracy. Under the continuing threat of a cutoff in trade credits, which would have given new vigor and a signal to seize the moment to the enemies of democ\u00adracy, we had to relent and sign the accord.\r\nNothing is more revealing of the tenor of the negotia\u00adtions than the insistence that our government assume the liability of planters products to a consortium of banks. Their private risk would have to become our public liability. None\u00adtheless, the demand stood and provided the none too subtle coercion\u2014sign or face the prospect of a protracted delay in the finalization of the debt restructuring program agreed to in March 1987.\r\nWe do not bow our heads in shame, for the shame is not ours. Yet even as necessity has forced our hand to agree\u00adment, we vow never again to let the patrimony of this nation lie at the feet of these noble houses that have finally shown the true face of foreign finance. [\r\n]\r\nFor the record, our foreign debt stands today in excess of $28 billion. The increase from $26.3 billion when we took power is largely accounted for by the weakening of the dollar against major currencies. In the next six years, we shall have to pay $20.4 billion to our official and private creditors. Net payments could average 5% of our total output. Close to 40% of government expenditures and over 45% of our projected merchandise export earnings, or 27% of all foreign earnings, will go towards servicing this debt. The bottomline, honorable members of Congress, is that we have been left little room for domestic error. It is for this reason that I have yielded more to prudence than desire in the reform measures I have enacted. I have aimed for modest successes to avoid a comprehensive failure.\r\nStill, despite our disappointments in this sector, I am pleased to report certain healthy signs in the economy. Re\u00adcession bottomed out in late 1986. GNP posted a modest growth at 1.5%; significant nonetheless because of the previous two years\u2019 negative performance. Exports posted a volume growth of 21.7% and provided the much \u00adneeded boost. To be candid, as we must always be, fortuity can account for these improvements as much as the reform measures we had taken. For the low 0.7% inflation rate in 1986 was largely a reflection of the drop in oil prices and the prevailing weak demand and purchasing power.\r\nOur reform measures, however, started to pay divi\u00addends in the first half of this year. Our estimate of first quarter GNP is 5.5%. Unemployment declined from 12% last year to 11.2%. The exchange rate remained relatively stable. And gross international reserves at the Central Bank stood at about $2.4 billion as of the end\u00ad of June 1987, or the equivalent of five months\u2019 merchandise imports.\r\nWhat is important is that this time it is not the world market but a reinvigorated domestic economy that is paving the way to recovery. Investments reversed their contrac\u00adtionary trend of the past three years. The 23% growth rate in investments promise a respectable real GNP growth for the rest of the year.\r\nThe current budget has a definite bias for health care, education and social services expenditures. Some 6.9 million people received food assistance from the Food and Nutrition Program in 1986. We began to expand the coverage of Medi\u00adcare. Teachers\u2019 salaries were increased, and a leaner and more relevant curriculum was adopted. Some 5.2 million poor availed of vital services such as self-employment assistance, job placement, and family planning. For 1987, we have made P4.2 billion available for long-term mortgages in support of the national shelter program.\r\nThe price of security and national honor, no less than liberty, is eternal vigilance. And that too has a price. Our country is threatened by totalitarian slavery on the Left and reversion to fascist terror and corruption on the Right. Meanwhile, the bottom is threatened by secession. On the bomb-shattered reviewing stand of our military academy, I vowed to end all threats to our democracy by the end of my term. We shall make good on that pledge. Meanwhile, it should be clear by now that no one in these struggles has had a monopoly of anguish and no one in these debates has had a monopoly of moral insight. It is in that light that we ventured to settle these issues outside the battlefield. For, surely, in the words of an architect of conflict and peace, \u201ca society becomes great not by the victories of its factions over each other but by its reconciliations.\u201d To this end, we shall continue to exhaust measures and avenues that will involve all our people in the task of moral and material reconstruction and national unity.\r\nStill our march towards nationhood must be unde\u00adterred and any threat to its progress will be countered with all the resources available to us, wielded with as much pas\u00adsion as self-preservation can muster.\r\nThe application of force will be as effective as it is judicious. The operational thrust of our Armed Forces is predicated on deterrence, preemption, and destruction. But the question is: Can we execute? If we have come to ask our soldiers to do battle to secure our way of life, then we have an obligation to equip them sufficiently for the fight.\r\nHaving exhausted the avenues of negotiation, we have armed them with the right. Now we must complete the complement with the material, organizational, and physical wherewithal to accomplish the task.\r\nWe have directed our immediate attention towards strengthening the chain of command, reinstilling discipline within the rank and file, and upgrading morale in the Armed Forces. We have placed renewed emphasis on training\u2014on the physical and mental readiness of the troops. Area Unified Commands have been established to facilitate force augmentation and complementation within and across the major services, particularly in areas where military operations are either imminent or ongoing.\r\nWe do, however, have a dire need to improve our intelligence, logistics, and communication services. Given our limited resources, we must improve our ratio of patrols to contacts, and our capability to maximize such combat opportunities as present themselves. We therefore need ordnance platforms and air transports for ground support, troop mobility, and medevac. We need a truly effective navy to secure our coastlines against fresh infusions of arms to rebel or fascist forces, and to punish any further attacks on our territorial honor and integrity, especially in the south.\r\nOur Armed Forces are asked to do more for less. De\u00adfense appropriations are down 1-and-1/4% of GNP from an average of 2% prior to 1986. We have been able to afford this reduction because of the moral victory we gained in the February revolution. Still, our defense expenditures are the lowest in ASEAN, and yet no country\u2019s security is so seriously threatened as ours.\r\nGiven the realities of our finances and our priorities, we will continue to press for efficiency in the Armed Forces. But we will need a sober assessment of adequacy.\r\nSome will say that force does not address the roots of insurgency. I will answer: Indeed, for such roots are ad\u00addressed by measures of economic improvement and equitable distribution. But such measures also need time to bear fruit; time that only feats of arms and negotiating from strength can buy us.\r\nWe have chosen to improve upon our capability to effectively manage force not so that we who desire peace could wage war, but rather so that those who would war upon us will realize, by the deadliness of our riposte, the virtues of peace.\r\nThus: \u201cwe shall bear arms when the intent of bearing them is just,\u201d and, if necessary, we shall mourn our dead by celebrating the birth of generations whose legacy shall be one nation, free, upright, and prosperous. [\r\n]\r\nI have spoken of our problems and I have sketched our programs, some of which have already borne appreciable results. A more detailed report will be submitted to this Congress. Succeeding messages to Congress will convey the legislative agenda of my administration, particularly the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, whose Congressional complement is eagerly awaited. We have prepared the ground for Congressional action on autonomy in the Cor\u00addillera, and we are determined to achieve genuine autonomy, and thus eliminate completely the issues that divide us from our Muslim brothers in a manner consistent with the honor and integrity of the Republic. [\r\n]\r\nIn deference to the Congress, Executive Orders issued last week have 1-year, 90-day, and 60-day effectivity dates. While we believe these measures merit immediate im\u00adplementation, Congress may want a second look.\r\nI would also hope that our proposed revisions of the Tariff Code and the rationalization of the government corporate sector shall be among the Congress\u2019 first con\u00adcerns, these being two areas that I find require the common counsel of executive and legislature.\r\nI have also spoken of our continuing vulnerabilities.\r\nNow let me speak of our strength.\r\nThe source of the new vigor and energy in the land is the sense of pride and renewed self-confidence of our people; pride in their unmatched political achievements. And flow\u00ading from that pride, the renewed confidence that we can improve things given the will and the courage to do what is right.\r\nThat pride and that confidence rest, however, on their continuing faith in the one solid and undeniable achievement of the great moral exertion of our people: the establishment of a democratic government under an honest and dedicated leadership. In short, it rests on their continuing faith in a government that will lead them to permanent peace, free\u00addom, and progress.\r\nAll the assaults on our government have fallen flat and harmless because the people believe in our government, in its honesty and sincere desire to work for the common good.\r\nWhen this session opened, the great powers of the State that were united in my person divided, and a portion has flowed to you. I have felt no loss but rather a great sense of achievement. The great work we set out to do, for which the nation made me its single leader, is completed. We have this day opened the door of Asian democracy\u2019s most famous home: the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines. [\r\n]\r\nWith the portion of power that has gone to you goes the shared responsibility to maintain the people\u2019s faith in government.\r\nWhile I held total power in my hands, and even after I had scattered the enemies of democracy, I kept ever in mind that power and glory are fleeting. That, in times to come, in the words of Gandhi, \u201cthe people will not judge us by the creed we profess or the label we wear or the slogans we shout but by our work, industry, sacrifice, honesty and purity of character.\u201d [\r\n]\r\nInthe great debates that will ring in this chamber, remember also those words of Gandhi: \u201cInsist upon truth by loving argument, by the testimony of your own life. Once you are assured of the truth, refuse to recant even to death. \u201c\r\nYou are blessed beyond all Congresses of the past or of any other nation. For here, ever to guide you, are the somber shades of the eternal Senators of our Republic: Jose W. Diokno and Benigno Aquino Jr. [\r\n] Even as their memory continues to freshen our sorrow, may their sacri\u00adfices ever nourish our idealism and commitment to our people, and remind us of the painful lesson that \u201ca govern\u00adment that is evil has no room for good men and women except in its prisons.\u201d\r\nThis day completes the circle of our democratic achieve\u00adments. Now Philippine democracy rests solidly upon the three pillars of freedom: the President, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, join me now in expressing our congratula\u00adtions and deepest gratitude to those who have this day by God\u2019s grace given to the nation the fully ripened fruit of freedom: ang ating mga kababayan, ang mamamayang Pilipino.

{"delivered": "1985-07-22 13:28:51+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 22, 1985]\r\nMr. Speaker; Mr. Prime Minister; distinguished members of the Batasang Pambansa:\r\nIn keeping with both tradition and duty, we meet today as trustees of our people to set anew the annual agenda for the nation.\r\nWe should perhaps take note that this tradition surrounding the opening of Parliament is as old as the nation itself, in the light of so much talk abroad about the alleged fragility of our democratic institutions.\r\nWhile the Batasang Pambansa is only one year old today, the declaration of partnership between the Presidency and Parliament dates back to the very birth of our First Republic.\r\nAnd if this Constitutional principle has survived intact after so many tidal changes in our national history, surely this is one sign that democracy has roots here in our land.\r\nThere are others, and I have come here tonight to report that our democracy has prevailed over a year of crisis and uncertainty, and to seek your support and collaboration in meeting a new turning point in national life.\r\nWhen we convened this assembly for the first time a year ago, we could feel within this chamber the fever of anxiety that gripped the nation. The economic crisis was at its height. There was turbulence and confrontation on our streets. And insurgency and subversion took the moment as an opportunity to revive and regroup.\r\nThe past year bears witness to our combined resolve and determination to be master of the crisis, and not its victim.\r\nWe have decisively stopped the slide of our economic fortunes, and restored them to health and renewed activity. Against every forecast of collapse made by so many, we have turned the odds in our favor and set a course towards recovery that is without parallel among nations similarly embattled.\r\nWe have demonstrated the efficacy of our democratic institutions and processes, in ensuring national stability and in framing policies and programs to meet the tide of crisis in our midst. The elections that brought this Parliament into being and the inaugural session of this assembly exemplify our response at this end.\r\nWe have met the grave challenge of subversion and insurgency, which again sought to take advantage of our economic travails and political trials. In the measure of the challenge, we have confronted the enemy on every front, we have instituted reforms in our counterinsurgency program and our armed forces, and we have strengthened the bond between our soldiery and our citizenry which is so essential for success in this struggle.\r\nWe have strengthened the mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation among all the sectors of our society, seeking relief for the plight of those who have been most adversely affected by the crisis and providing for fruitful partnership between the private sector and the government. A year ago, the basis of social concord was under grave challenge. Today, that is now largely recovered and strengthened.\r\nWe have protected the gains and the reforms of the past decade in our response to the crisis, even though we have had to implement stringent measures of economy and prudence. No major social program of reform has been abrogated by our belt tightening efforts; rather savings have been generated in other areas so that the reform effort would continue.\r\nAnd in our relations with the rest of the world, we have the confidence of other nations and international institutions in our ability to surmount our problems and to meet our obligations and commitments. The seal of international credit worthiness handed us by the International Monetary Fund is only one aspect of this. As important and significant is the renewed vigor of our bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.\r\nNot all the adversities and challenges are behind us. Our agenda remains heavy and difficult. But we have moved beyond the arc of crisis into a new phase of struggle.\r\nAt certain times in our history, the aspirations of our people and the course of events converge at a single time to shape a turning point in national life.\r\nSo it was in 1896 when this land was rocked by the tremors of revolution. So it was in 1941 and 1972.\r\nSo it is today. The crisis of the past two years and our efforts to surmount it have led us inexorably to this decisive turning point in our history when we either thrust our economy forward into full modernization or forever remain in the shallows; when we either stop once and for all the challenge of Communism in this country or be overrun by it; when we either attain the full promise of democracy or be led away into alternative routes toward the future.\r\nTo meet this challenge, we must address squarely those great issues on which the future of the nation hangs.\r\nWhen we speak of national priorities today, the first on our minds is the economy, and specifically the progress of the national economic recovery program.\r\nTo understand recent developments and directions in the economy, we must first understand the nature of the crisis that struck us in 1983.\r\nTo simplify a rather complex phenomenon, the crisis stemmed from two factors: Our vulnerability to the unexpected drop in access to international credit and high interest rates, and our difficulty in managing our balance of payments position with limited resources.\r\nThese two factors were already constricting the growth of the economy when tragedy struck former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in August 1983. The tragic event, however, triggered the financial crisis, making a tough situation suddenly critical. A debt moratorium had to be enforced on October 17, 1983.\r\nIt was in these circumstances that we formulated the National Economic Recovery Program. The program which began in 1984 stressed five main lines of action:\r\nThese adjustments were often criticized as too severe and painful, but these were necessary to put the economy back on its feet.\r\nWe did not flinch in biting the bullet as they say. With will and with imagination, we have taken the course to relief and recovery. And today, as we meet here in this chamber, we can proudly say that we have passed the initial test. Economic recovery has begun.\r\nThe financial package for the period from October 17, 1983, to December 1986 amounts to $13,760 million. Of this amount, about $3.6 billion represent \u201cnew money\u201d principally intended for the general requirements of the economy.\r\nThe most critical component under the program is the standby facility from the IMF amounting to SDR615 million or approximately $610 million. The Philippine request for this facility was approved by the IMF board on December 14, 1984. We drew the first tranche of $80 million last December 28, 1984, and this was used to pay the bridge financing loan extended by the governments of the United States, Japan, and Korea subsequent draw downs will be contingent upon the achievement of certain quarterly performance criteria outlined in the economic adjustment program. We expect the release of the second tranche of $107 million this July because we have met successfully the performance target agreed with the IMF last May 31, 1985.\r\nThe financial package likewise provides the country with $925 million in new loans and a credit line of about $3 billion to finance imports, and reschedules over a period of 10 years maturities of $5.8 billion, falling due between 1983 and 1986.\r\nThe pledge of new money by our commercial creditors will enable us to service our external debt obligations on a current basis, including the elimination of arrears by the end of our IMF program period. The restoration of the trade facility, on the other hand, will reopen normal trade financing whose disruption had imposed a heavy cost burden on domestic producers.\r\nIt has been suggested by some quarters that the government did not have to deal with the International Monetary Fund with respect to our debt payments. What, in fact, were our other options? We could have followed the example of countries like Cuba, North Vietnam, and North Korea, which did not keep up their payments. Or else we could have merely ignored our default without any regard for the consequences to the creditors.\r\nDealing with the IMF and other creditors, however, was the only honorable alternative, first, because we are a signatory to the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1945 and cannot therefore renege on our debt payments; and second, because we have to protect our external position in view of future requirements for capital.\r\nWith respect to the economic stabilization program, we are meeting successfully the key objective of improving our balance of payments position.\r\nThe deficit in the current account was reduced to $1.3 billion in 1984 from $2.7 billion in 1983, surpassing the target of $1.5 billion set for the year. The large improvement in the current accounts resulted in an overall balance of payment surplus of $243 million in 1984, reversing a deficit of $2.1 billion in 1983.\r\nThe result of the first four months of 1985 are even more positive with a current account surplus of $165 million as compared to a deficit of $502 million for the same period in 1984.\r\nThis was, however, due to a more significant drop in imports by 12.6% while exports fell by 11.4% over the same period in 1984. By end of May, the trade deficit was narrowed down by 22% to $220 million compared to $283 million for the same period in 1984. The decline in export receipts was mainly due to unfavorable markets for our major traditional exports, like coconut, sugar, copper concentrates, logs, timber, offsetting the gains from nontraditional exports in chemicals, copper metal, textile yarns, handicrafts, nonmetallic mineral manufactures, garments, and nickel and fish products.\r\nOn the other hand, nonmerchandise trade improved immensely from a deficit of $336 million during the first quarter of 1984 to a surplus of $210 million for the first four months this year.\r\nWe have built up in international reserves to $1.06 billion as of June 1985.\r\nOur total foreign liabilities at the end of December 1984 amounted to $25.4 billion. As of the end of March 1985, this declined by $212 million to the level of $25.2 billion.\r\nDevelopments in the external account, together with prudent monetary and fiscal policies, have stabilized the foreign exchange rate and stopped the depreciation of the peso.\r\nIn the domestic sector, the rapid acceleration of commodity prices has leveled off. The inflation rate has declined by a significant 7.34 percentage points from 34.99% in May to 27.65% in June this year. Even more gratifying is the mere increase of 1.5% in the inflation rate from January to June of this year.\r\nThe same downward trend in inflation rates was observed in all areas of the country. Metro Manila\u2019s rate decreased even more significantly by 8.72 percentage points from 30.91% in May to only 22.19% in June. For areas outside Metro Manila, the inflation rate slid down further by 7.1 percentage points from 35.83% last month to 28.73% in June.\r\nSubstantial decreases in food prices were observed in many areas of the country, notably in Metro Manila. From January to June this year, prices of vegetables and fruits declined by 4.32% fish by 0.50%, and eggs by 2.14%. Between May and June, there have been encouraging decreases in the prices of certain food items.\r\nAt the same time, the interest rate (Manila reference rate, 90 days) has gradually tapered from a peak of 37.4% in November 1984 to 23.6% as of July 19 this year. For the first six months of this year, the interest rate averaged 25.6%.\r\nThe deceleration of the inflation rate was due to a number of policy measures, significant of which is the effective management of liquidity by limiting the growth in reserve money through active open market operations and other credit instruments. Consequently, reserve money expansion was limited to 13.6% in the end of May 1985, reaching P30.9 billion and well within the P34.4 billion target during the same period.\r\nYou must realize how difficult it is to contain a budget deficit at such low levels but we were able to cut our overall deficit to 1.8% of GNP in 1984, and to keep it within the program target of 2.0% of GNP. This improvement was due to an austere spending policy, together with an increased revenue collection from implementation of new revenue measures and improved tax collection.\r\nCertain taxes were modified to alleviate the burden on the taxpayers, provide business opportunities, and broaden the tax base. In particular, the tax base has been broadened mainly by withdrawing tax exemptions from public and private enterprises and by shifting from specific to an ad valorem made of tax levy. A uniform tax rate on interest earnings has been adopted, the method of inventory valuation for income and corporate taxation has been modified, and a levy of a 1% tax on all foreign exchange transactions in lieu of the levy on selected transaction has been imposed.\r\nTo reduce the cost of raw materials and make our industries operate more efficiently, average nominal tariff rates were lowered to 28% in January this year from the pretariff reform average rate of 43%. A uniform markup of 25% on imported goods has also been adopted. Moreover, an additional 46 nonessential and unclassified consumer items can now be freely imported without prior approval from the Central Bank, bringing to 967 the total number of liberalized items.\r\nIn the energy sector, our dependence on oil imports has gradually declined due to a continuous substitution of domestic energy resources for imported energy. The share of indigenous energy resources to our total energy consumption has increased to 44% for the first four months this year from last year\u2019s 42%. Consequently, our oil import bill for the same period this year has gone down by 6%. By year-end, we will be 50% self-sufficient in energy requirements.\r\nMoreover, our government has veered away from the artificial pricing of electricity and petroleum products to reflect as close as possible the supply and demand for these products in the market. In particular, our government has narrowed down the price differential between close substitutes such as premium gasoline and diesel and has gradually reduced the level of subsidized consumption for residential customers.\r\nIn the agricultural sector, pricing, marketing, and other forms of administrative controls are being phased out in support of a balanced agro-industrial development. The retail ceiling price of rice will be lifted in October this year, while that of corn has been lifted since October last year. Domestic trading of sugar has been returned to the private sector and the export marketing system for coconut products has been liberalized. I have ordered the preparation of rehabilitation and development plan for the sugar industry even as we provide food and other assistance to displaced workers.\r\nFurthermore, the importation of wheat and the distribution of\u2019 flour have been opened to the private sector.\r\nThese measures will give more incentives to the farm sector to produce more efficiently as agricultural product prices would now reflect competitive market conditions.\r\nI want to say a few words here on why we have had to import rice recently. These importations are due to the production shortfalls caused by the combined effects of the prolonged drought in 1983 and 1984, typhoons, spiraling production costs, and standstill on credit. The current imports will beef up our buffer stocks for the lean months of July through September. This has become compelling because while palay production declined during the drought-stricken years, per capita consumption of rice rose. And it is imperative that the National Food Authority holds enough rice in stock to stabilize the market when rice prices are deregulated in October l.\r\nSignificantly, this year, we expect to harvest our largest rice crop ever. We foresee a harvest of 163.9 million cavans of palay, equivalent to 5.4 million MT of milled rice. This is 4.5% higher than last year\u2019s harvest, and 1.2% higher than our 1982 record crop.\r\nMeanwhile, there have been some improvements in income distribution in our country. The share of the bottom 60% of families in the income ladder increased by 1.2 percentage points from 21.7% during the fourth quarter of 1981 to 22.9% during the same period in 1983, based on quarterly integrated surveys of households.\r\nAverage annual incomes of both rural and urban households have increased over the years. The average rural household income increased fivefold from P2,818 in 1971 to P14,646 in 1982, while average urban household income improved fourfold from P5,867 in 1971 to P23,637 in 1982.\r\nThe improvement in the palay yield from an average of 30 cavans in 1972 to about 50 cavans in 1984 has significantly contributed to the increase in rural and agricultural household incomes. This was due to our government\u2019s continuing thrust on agriculture as the linchpin of economic growth. Furthermore, the current minimum wage for plantation and nonplantation agricultural workers has been increased to P46.67 and P36.67, respectively, from P4.75 in 1972.\r\nThe average urban household income, on the other hand, has been positively affected by the series of minimum wage adjustments. These have raised the present minimum wage of nonagricultural workers in and outside Metro Manila to P57.08 and P56.00, respectively, from P8.00 in 1972. In the public sector, government employees were given a 10% salary adjustment beginning January this year. These adjustments were made to enable workers to cope with the price increases and improve the general standard of living.\r\nThese encouraging developments in the economy come at a time when the economic recovery of the developed economies is slowing down. Despite the softening of international interest rates and world oil prices, commodity prices are similarly declining.\r\nThe tight stabilization program and weak demand for our exports by our major trading partners have impaired our ability to restore economic growth. Nevertheless, the expansion of the agricultural sector by 2.1% as of the first quarter prevented a larger fall in real output. The improved income in agriculture will raise the purchasing power of two-thirds of our population who live in the rural areas and eventually raise the demand for industries and revive industrial activity.\r\nThe latest statistics show that the level of unemployment has leveled off. The first quarter data for 1985 showed an actual decrease in the unemployment rate to 5.8% from 6.3% and the underemployment rate to 24% from 36.5%, over the same period last year. The number of laid-off workers for the first four months of this year also decreased by 43.7% to 23,280 from 41,326 over the same period last year.\r\nAn even closer look at the employment data showed that the number of self-employed increased by 12.8% in the first quarter this year over the same period last year. This offsets a decline in the number of wage and salaried workers, which fell by 1.6% over the same period last year. This reflects the resiliency of our people when they venture into entrepreneurial activities as a matter of economic adjustment and social protection.\r\nTo assist the laid-off workers, an additional P45.6 million was released as unemployment assistance loans during the first semester. Industrial peace was promoted with the increased number of collective bargaining agreements reaching a total of 1,931 as of May covering some 255,000 workers.\r\nSugar workers who were affected by the slump in the world price of sugar were given assistance in the form of an emergency employment program. Under the program, displaced sugar planters and millers were encouraged to plant food and cash crops in sugar lands rendered idle due to drastic production setbacks. In addition, I have recently imposed a sugar production quota of 1.6 million tons to keep this commodity available in the domestic market as well as to fulfill our country\u2019s export quota requirement to the U.S. I have also directed the Philippine Sugar Commission to ensure that the domestic price of sugar be maintained at P300 per picul to enable sugar producers to gain reasonable profits.\r\nI have ordered the release of funds to rehabilitate areas devastated by the recent typhoons. I assure you, there are enough stocks of rice to meet any contingency.\r\nMoreover, P1.4 million was disbursed in the form of long-term soft loans to assist distressed hospitals in upgrading their facilities and services in the first five months of 1985. The primary health care approach has also been instituted in 37,705 barangays as of March 1985. Meanwhile, Pag-IBIG housing loans availed by members reached P4,368.6 million in April 1985, an increase of 12.7% from the December 1984 level.\r\nAll these gains, taken singly or together, are a signpost telling us that the recovery program is working, and that the sacrifices and tasks we have borne with fortitude have not been for naught. When we say that the Cassandras of doom among us and in the foreign media have been wrong in their prognosis on the country, these are the realities on which we base our claim.\r\nBut we have only passed the first stage in the arduous road to recovery. We cannot linger on the road and risk a lapse to complacency.\r\nWhat was true at the onset of the crisis is still true today: Our economy, hence our recovery efforts, are challenged by circumstances beyond our control, by conditions beyond our shores. We are confronted by a slowdown in world trade, by a growth recession in our major trading partner, the U.S., by a fall in export prices, and by a growing wave to protectionism in the developed economies of U.S., Japan, and Europe. These will hamper our prospects for a higher export growth, but this should encourage us to further diversify our exports and search for other nontraditional markets for our products.\r\nWe must recognize that the emergence of a dynamic national economy will not be an accident of development, but the product of a national effort animated by a vision of the future.\r\nAt least six areas of economic management need to be subjected to further action and reform for the rest of 1985 and 1986.\r\nFirst, we shall continue to adhere to a disciplined financial and budgetary program to stabilize our balance of payment position, maintain an enduring reduction in the inflation rate, and exercise greater control on public spending.\r\nWe hope to maintain positive interest rates principally by keeping the inflation rate as low as possible to encourage greater domestic production and investments. We expect the inflation rate to decelerate further to around 10% by the end of this year and further down to a single-digit level by 1988. Money supply expansion will be restricted to around 15% to further bring down the inflation rate.\r\nDomestic borrowings of the public sector will be regulated and the national government budgetary deficit will be further cut down this year.\r\nThe stimulus for growth will definitely come from the invigorated rural and agricultural sectors and an intensified export activity in lieu of a slack on government spending and private real investments.\r\nSecond, we shall strengthen and, where necessary, rehabilitate the financial system to improve its efficiency and to restore public confidence.\r\nIn particular, government financial institutions will be reformed to avoid unnecessary duplication of functions as well as excessive and unessential competition with the private sector. We shall actively assist mergers and consolidations among banks to encourage them to build up their resources and equity bases. We shall pursue the restructuring of the legal and administrative framework for private institutions. Also, the Central Bank\u2019s role as a stabilizer and overseer of banks will be further strengthened.\r\nThird, we shall limit government sector involvement to socially desirable activities and to those wherein the private sector is unable or unwilling to invest in due to unprofitability, high risks, and exorbitant cost involved but which activities are also of high social and economic priority. This would enable the private sector to continue its dynamic role in our economic recovery in the context of a free enterprise economy. Our government can then utilize its limited and critical resources more efficiently, effectively, and economically as possible over the long run through the judicious use and management of government corporations, among others.\r\nToward this end, the coordination, supervision, and regulation of government corporations will be tightened to ensure public accountability. We shall subject government corporations to more rigorous performance criteria, based on their economic and social contribution, actual output and productivity, and cost recovery record. In addition, private firms and assets which have been transferred or acquired by the government due to foreclosure, default, or nonfulfillment of contractual obligations shall be rehabilitated only after they have been proven to be satisfactorily viable. Otherwise, their divestiture to the private sector at the best terms available will be undertaken.\r\nFourth, we shall step up the revenue generating capacity of the public sector through an upgrading of the tax and nontax system and through more efficient resource utilization.\r\nLet me say at once, we do not propose or contemplate any new taxes except where action is required to repeal and change certain tax measures in the interests of improvement and fairness.\r\nTo improve resource mobilization, we will strive for a more efficient tax collection system to achieve a broader tax base. Improvement in the collection and utilization of tax resources shall be the focus of our efforts. Volatile international taxes shall be replaced by more desirable domestic taxes. The tax and gross receipts on foreign exchange transactions and the remaining 5% additional ad valorem import duty shall eventually be phased out in favor of alternative and better tax measures.\r\nTo ensure more efficient resource utilization, public investments will be regularly programmed. Due to our limited public funds, we have to curb any future spending. Priority shall be given to ongoing projects, those with the highest economic and social rates of return, and those which are financed from foreign sources.\r\nFifth, we shall revitalize the agricultural sector, which is envisioned to propel national recovery and sustain economic growth in the coming years.\r\nIn terms of output, agricultural value added is expected to increase owing to the implementation of various policy reforms in the agricultural sector. The reforms shall be built on the principles of liberalization, deregulation, and technological modernization. Policy decisions will be aimed at developing a more buoyant and competitive agricultural sector and at improving the incentives to small farmers.\r\nFinally, we must press on structural reforms to improve the efficiency of resource allocation, to make our industries internationally competitive, and to develop and diversify domestic sources of energy.\r\nFor such changes to be undertaken smoothly, it is imperative that we have industrial peace. It is imperative that there be no disruption in the production process which will hamper our government\u2019s efforts to ensure price stability and a favorable financial environment to encourage more investments, the creation of livelihood opportunities, and a rise in incomes and wages.\r\nToward this end, I have recently created the Presidential Council for Economic Recovery. I have directed this body to address issues of importance to economic recovery and to study ways and means to promote a harmonious relationship among the tripartite sectors\u2014government, workers, and employers.\r\nWhen we appeal for industrial peace, we do not propose to make labor a scapegoat for the crisis that befell us or a sacrificial lamb on the altar of economic recovery. We are merely appealing for reason and sobriety in the approach to disputes and differences in our industries. And we make the same strong appeal to management never to make the climate of hard times a convenient club with which to frustrate the demands of labor.\r\nIn sum, we need the energetic cooperation of all in diffusing the climate of confrontation on labor management issues with voluntary steps on both sides to amicably discuss and settle issues. Let us take every effort to avoid factory shutdowns as our ready recourse to attain social justice.\r\nFor the productivity we seek simply will not be achieved if our factories and plants do not operate. All of us in this country will sink or swim together, and we shall swim above the water only if we will it.\r\nWe have always stressed the important role of our most valued resource, the Filipino people, in the successful implementation of our recovery program. The other side of this is government\u2019s obligation and commitment to the improvement of the quality of people\u2019s lives, especially of those in the disadvantaged groups.\r\nAccordingly, through more efficient and effective resource use, we will expand and improve the delivery of basic social services.\r\nIn health and nutrition, the primary health care approach will continue to ensure the provision of essential health services to the most basic communities. Also, we will further strengthen the herbal medicine program to cut down reliance on imported drugs and introduce acupuncture in various hospitals to reduce the costs of medical care. Likewise, we are committed to further improve and develop the health infrastructure network, particularly hospitals, to meet the needs of the growing population.\r\nIn education, the quality and equity in elementary education will be sustained through the Program for Decentralized Education Development (PRODED). Through this program, the elementary curriculum is gradually being revised to emphasize the 3Rs and the inculcation of humanism and Filipinism. Improvements initiated by PRODED at the elementary level will be continued onto the secondary education program.\r\nThe study-now-pay-later plan will be further expanded to extend educational loans to poor but deserving tertiary students. Likewise, scholarship programs will be broadened at both undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\nIn housing, we will shift our shelter production program to rural areas and make it more affordable to a greater number of people by offering low-cost housing units. Moreover, no new massive housing units\u2019 construction will take place, except those already approved for production and those which are in the process of construction.\r\nWe have also limited the Pag-IBIG housing to P50,000 to ensure that the program benefits accrue to the low- and middle-income groups. Furthermore, an addition of three new housing loan benefits has been approved aimed at helping Pag-IBIG members for their educational, medical, and other needs; for home improvement; and for organized labor and government employee organizations.\r\nThe Rent Control Law has also been implemented and rents have been programmed for adjustments on a staggered basis to help some 1 million house renters all over the land cope with the current economic crunch and to encourage more social and low-cost housing activities.\r\nWe shall also step up local and overseas job placements to compensate for the decline in employment opportunities due to the general slowdown in industrial activity. Moreover, we will create more jobs through the Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK) and the Kilusang Sariling Sikap (KSS) programs.\r\nThe goals of our recovery program have always converged on the overriding goal of human resource development. Every measure of growth we have in the last analysis comes down to what it means for people.\r\nIn pursuing these initiatives for the economy and society, peace and security are imperative to success. This administration has shown how much can be done to strengthen law and order in our social life, and to secure the Republic from every threat to overthrow it.\r\nAs economic difficulties have beset us during the last three years, however, those seeking the overthrow of government by force found the time opportune to expand and intensify their activities. And today the peace and security situation is of priority concern.\r\nAlthough stability has been attained with respect to the secessionist movement in the south, other elements now pose grave threats to our communities, the most critical of these being the Communist New People\u2019s Army.\r\nThere has been a tendency, particularly on the part of foreign media and foreign observers, to exaggerate the extent of the Communist threat, so much so that we are now the subject of all kinds of scenarios on when and how the Communists will take over. This kind of \u201coveracting\u201d on the part of those who do not know the situation first hand merely serves to confuse the issues and do not help us any in dealing with the realities of the problem.\r\nWhile the CPP-NPA has managed, since 1969, to increase its strength, improve its firepower, and expand its political influence, it is still far from being an immediate threat to government and overall national stability. But it does pose a serious threat to peace and order in some of our communities, and to life and welfare for several thousands of our people. Intelligence estimates today place NPA membership at between 10,000 to 12,000 men, and this armed force is potent enough to affect peace and order conditions in 4% of our 41,615 barangays where it has political and military organizations and in the additional 9% which it occasionally visits.\r\nLikewise, it is significant that 70% of violent incidents perpetrated in the countryside and in some urban areas in recent years have been initiated by the NPA. Political bias should never cloud our perceptions of these acts of violence and terrorism. From January 1985 to June this year, the NPA mounted attacks on 27 municipal buildings and 29 integrated national INP stations, causing an estimated damage of P92 million. In the period from 1981 to 1984, damage caused by NPA attacks amounted to P330 million. In terms of lives lost, NPA violence and terrorism have taken the lives of 600 civilians, including 46 government officials. .\r\nOur response to the insurgency has been a dual strategy. In the short term, this strategy consists of the uncompromising utilization of military power and the application of national security laws against insurgents. For the long term, however, our strategy seeks to achieve social, economic, and political development as the lasting guarantee for social peace.\r\nIt is worth remembering that the Philippines stand unique in Asia in having successfully beaten a communist insurgency twice, and without any help from foreign troops. The record of our current campaign assures us that we will do so again.\r\nFor we have not been standing still, resting on past victories, in confronting the present insurgency challenge. As the enemy has changed in tactics and weaponry in recent years, so have we on our part sought to make major adjustments in our counterinsurgency program, not least in terms of reforms within our armed forces.\r\nDuring the past year, the AFP undertook major reforms in its command structure, personnel training and retraining, unit logistics, and tactics. We have placed the highest priority on both troop discipline and morale.\r\nAt the same time, we have launched a P1 billion civic action program to be implemented together with the military campaigns in those areas where the NPA operates. Increased civil relations work has enabled our armed forces to mobilize local populations to help government in civic action programs, and in drawing up integrated security plans for the entire communities.\r\nAs this twin-pronged strategy is seeping into rebel-infested areas, we have come to see the softness of NPA support among our people. We see how much of its hold on communities is built on plain intimidation and terror, because government troops can only visit these areas from time to time. And we are more confident than ever that we can establish the kind of social and political infrastructure in these areas that will eliminate this presence in the countryside.\r\nTo succeed at this, however, we need to be concerned about providing support to our armed forces, instead of denying it the wherewithal to fight the insurgency. Let us face the fact squarely that the reduction of the defense budget in 1983 and 1984 has done much to sap the potency of our programs.\r\nLet us remember that the structure of compensation under the military bases agreement was not a capricious decision, but an integral part of our defense program.\r\nWe need likewise to rebuild anew the links between our military and our people, because upon those ties the final solution to communist insurgency can be forced. Let us recognize that while abuses have been committed by our men in uniform, our defense establishment is not passive before its shortcomings. It is striving today to weed out undesirables from its ranks and to institute greater professionalism and discipline in the corps.\r\nIn human history, it has often been the fate of a nation\u2019s soldiery \u201cto be neglected and ignored in times of calm, and to be trustingly looked to in moments of fright.\u201d We must not make the mistake of moving to support our armed forces when the enemy is already at the gates.\r\nAnd let us remember that in the kind of world we live in today, moments of calm and peace are merely the cover under which insurgency and subversion fester. There is no specific time for us to be watchful in our vigil over the security of the nation. Every moment is a test of our watch.\r\nTo say this is to underscore the fact that we must fight vigorously also on another front: the battle of ideas.\r\nIt has often seemed to me that it is on this front where our shortcomings are greatest, because we have been complacent while the other side has been committed, obsessed, fanatical. We have been oblivious to the transparency of radical ideas, while being hesitant in the advocacy of our own ideology. And many of our young have been seduced by the false promises of apocalyptic change.\r\nWe need have no fear as we engaged in this struggle of ideas, in this test between our rival faiths and ideologies. But it is no longer enough to simply trust to the worn saw that our people will never be won over by communism or socialism, because of ideals and beliefs they were born to.\r\nTradition is indeed on the side of democracy. But it is vain and illusory to imagine that this struggle can be won without renewing ourselves many times by an act of faith. It cannot be won without tapping anew the great resources of democratic ideology and tradition. It cannot be won if we do not carry the struggle also to the citadels of the enemy, and underscore the sour fruit of communist and socialist experience.\r\nThis is the reason why I have not stopped insisting that we must develop and nurture our own democratic ideology, one rooted in our experience and needs.\r\nThis is why I believe it is not enough that we parrot the beliefs of others in democratic processes and institutions. We must understand their practical import to society, and why they must be defended.\r\nSo much of political life is dominated by clich\u00e9s and empty slogans. Yet the point of politics and government is exceedingly practical and concrete.\r\nThis is the lesson we have been learning in our long education in the ways of democracy.\r\nThus, we know now that for a democratic political system to be truly effective, a sufficient foundation must be laid in terms of the people\u2019s control over their own affairs. It is not enough that citizens vote periodically in elections. They must participate actively in making decisions that affect their economic and social lives.\r\nThis is the reason why we have sought to introduce barangay into the basic unit of our society and why we now diffuse political power to some 240,000 elective officials, where before our people only had some 15,000 elected.\r\nWe know too that in spite of all the hectoring from others about how democracy should develop in our land, we can only trust and listen to our experiences and our needs. Our institutions must be in the image of our needs, otherwise they will not serve us well.\r\nI believe this is what we have at last found, after many pitfalls and starts, after many trials and errors; a democratic ideology that can serve our aspirations as a people.\r\nThis Parliament no less than the Presidency is a reflection of that faith.\r\nThe stability of government today, the strength of leadership, is a function of our experience of governments paralyzed by check and balance and dominated by faction and division.\r\nClearly there are still many areas in which our political system and processes require improvement and modification, but the basic edifice is already in place and we have all a stake in defending it.\r\nSimilarly, the task of improving political process and institutions in our country must be an abiding concern, and this assembly is the seat for deliberation on such initiatives.\r\nAt this crucial time in national life, we must stress anew the need for further reform in the machinery of government. There are three areas in which we should move for improvement:\r\nIt was once said: \u201cGovernment is personal. It is as compassionate and vibrant\u2014or as ineffectual and spiritless\u2014as the men and women who shape the laws, who make the decisions, and who translate programs into action.\u201d\r\nI believe there is much that we can do to improve the quality of government itself\u2014its machinery, its manpower, and its methods\u2015so that our programs may truly touch the lives of our people and our communities.\r\nIn all these initiatives I have proposed, we need the support and collaboration of this assembly. In some areas, we shall look to you for action that requires the making of specific law and policy.\r\nHigh on your legislative agenda, I urge the honorable members of the Batasan to support the 1986 budget proposal which is the lifeblood of the government\u2019s action program for the nation.\r\nIn line with strengthening the political process, we urge the speedy passage of electoral reforms which are vital for the holding of free elections next year.\r\nIn support of agriculture as the linchpin of the national economy, we shall seek legislation providing for incentives to agricultural development.\r\nTo rationalize the role of private corporations in a free enterprise economy, we shall seek guidance from the Batasan to improve the internal structure and operations of public corporations, and to effectively supervise and regulate corporate activities.\r\nIn support of every initiative, we take in the sphere of social equity, government reform, and peace and security; we shall as ever seek the counsel and assistance of this assembly.\r\nThis is the course we ask the nation to take.\r\nThese are the policies and programs we commend to the support and collaboration of the Batasan.\r\nWe have no illusions that these proposed policies and programs will resolve overnight every problem before us, or fulfill in a fortnight every aspiration we nurture.\r\nWe know rather that each step in this difficult agenda, each initiative we propose, calls for effort, for dedication, and above all, for collaboration among us and with all sectors of society.\r\nThe recovery and growth of the national economy, the well-being and welfare of our 54 million people, the campaign against Communist insurgency and for civility and law in our social life, the revitalization of our armed forces and of the bonds between our soldiery and our people, the strengthening of our democratic institutions and of the apparatus of government\u2014all these tasks are to be hurdled step by step, with patience if necessary but always with the determination to see them through to their fulfillment.\r\nAll these tasks are surely not for this leadership alone, not for our sympathizers alone, to pursue and bring to fruition.\r\nSurely this business of making our nation strong and prosperous is above partisanship.\r\nI cannot believe that any Filipino, any of our leaders regardless of party, would wish us to fail in these labors in the petty hope that on our failure they may then rise to power.\r\nI cannot believe that any countryman of ours\u2015the heir of so many historic struggles by our fathers for national independence\u2015would invite upon this land the renewed intervention of foreigners.\r\nLet us, if we must, contend in the political arena.\r\nBut when the issue is the welfare, the honor, and the future of the nation, let us be one and undivided.\r\nLet us remember the words said so long ago, but which today are still fresh and full of meaning:\u00a0\u201cLet our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but our country.\u201d\r\nLadies and gentlemen of this assembly, when I came here a year ago, it was to forge our partnership at a time of trial for the nation. I return today at a moment of resurgent hope and pride in our land.\r\nI spoke with no little apprehension then. I speak with confidence and optimism now.\r\nFor this turning point in national life is also a moment of opportunity for the nation.\r\nLet us seize the moment together. Let us make common cause, whatever party we may belong to, in strengthening our one and only family\u2014our people and our country.\r\nThank you and good day.", "title": "A Turning Point for the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1982-07-26 18:07:49+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 1982]\r\nThe President; Mr. Speaker; distinguished colleagues in the Batasang Pambansa or the interim National Assembly; guests from foreign lands, especially the members of the diplomatic corps; countrymen; my friends:\r\nToday, we meet perhaps for the last regular session before the elections for the next Batasang Pambansa. We affirm anew the indissoluble bonds which unite the legislative and the executive responsibilities of our government to each other, and unite our labors to the destiny of our people as well as our nation.\r\nAnd perhaps no other occasion concentrates in more vivid focus the efforts of the past as well as the enthusiasm of the present and the plans of tomorrow than this moment of the opening of the regular session of this Batasang Pambansa. For this is the time to review the progress of our labors; and this is also the time to look squarely at the problems we face and chart directions towards our future.\r\nAnd why is this so? Because two months from now, we shall mark the completion of a decade, 10 years in our national life, since that critical moment when the nation embarked on the course of crisis government and national transformation. And there is not one among us today, be he supporter or critic of the administration, who does not feel and recognize that so much of what constitutes our national life today is the offspring of that decade, those 10 years of change.\r\nFive months hence, we shall commence the implementation of our new Five-Year Development Program for the years 1983 to 1987. And no one is in doubt either that in facing up to these problems and challenges of the day, national planning for the future cannot merely rest on the perspective of a single year or two years. And thus, we have both a five-year program and a long-range program that goes all the way to the end of the century.\r\nThe times call for a much more fundamental assessment of the position of the nation today, of the trends in national life, of the character of our institutions\u2014political, economic, social\u2014of the situation of the various sectors of society, of the status of our relations with the world, and of the nature of the problems that we face.\r\nThe perspective of 10 years affords us a view of the evolution of our political life and of our government: from the martial necessity and crisis government, through the period of transition, and finally culminating in the termination or the lifting of martial law, and the adoption of a modified parliamentary system, the proclamation of a New Republic\u2014a new system of government.\r\nAnd this Assembly itself is a manifestation of this decade of change; and so is the office that I represent before this body. For if you will remember, we started the sessions of this Assembly with me as the presiding officer. Then I became Prime Minister. After becoming Prime Minister came the amendments to the Constitution, and I was shuttled back to the position of President.\r\nOur quest for an effective system of government and a dynamic political order has been a long one, indeed, and perhaps in all candors we can say to the history writer that we have tried almost every option and alternative.\r\nIn 1973, we took the first step with the ratification of the new Constitution to replace the 1935 Constitution, which had been born of our colonial experience. Incidentally, going through the records while preparing for my appearance before you, I came across the original decision of the Supreme Court wherein was indicated some skepticism about the ratification of the Constitution by the raising of hands; and the statement of some of our constitutional authorities to the effect that a majority of the members of the Supreme Court had declared the inadequacy of the means by which the Constitution was ratified. But no reference, of course, was made to the fact that after the January 27 ratification by the raising hands, I called another plebiscite on July 8, 1973, and resubmitted this Constitution to a secret ballot plebiscite, the Constitution was overwhelmingly ratified in a secret ballot under the supervision and control of a constitutional body, the Commission of Elections.\r\nIn 1976, in keeping with amendments to the Constitution, we established the Batasang Bayan, the Legislative Advisory Council; the members of whom you will remember were elected by the Sangguniang Pampook who were in turn elected by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan at Panlungsod. They were elected members but with only advisory capability. However, their recommendations were often adopted by the President/Prime Minister. This was a step towards the creation of a legislative assembly.\r\nIn 1978, in accordance with the October 1976 amendments to the Constitution, we held a national election for the interim Batasang Pambansa which I now address. The Assembly forthwith assumed legislative powers with the President/Prime Minister later on, but in practice actually performed the powers of lawmaking.\r\nThrough all this time, our main concern was to perform and to prepare adequately for the transitions from crisis government to representative government or, perhaps, utilizing the terminology of Section 5 of Article XVII of the Constitution, to give priority to the measures for the transition of the government from a presidential to a parliamentary form of government. But even more were we concerned that when martial law would be fully lifted, an effective system of government would take its place and face whatever crisis may confront the nation.\r\nThat historic process of transition began with the lifting of martial law on January 17, 1981 in the Heroes Hall of Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. Three months later, of April 17, 1981, our people voted on critical amendments to the Constitution vital to the establishment of a new structure and system of government in our country. One of the questions asked was: \u201cDo you vote in favor of a modified parliamentary system as provided for in the following provisions?\u201d Note that the question specifically stated a modified parliamentary form of government. At the same time, however, it provided for a president directly elected by the people.\r\nOn June 16, 1981, we held the first presidential elections in our country since 1969. And forthwith, we brought to birth the new Philippine Republic when I took office as President on June 30, 1981.\r\nWhy do I recount this evolution of our government and our political institutions? Because thus have we developed step-by-step the government which now is the agency for political stability and for the confrontation of all the changes and the crises that may confront our country and people.\r\nWe can surely say now that we have not only managed the difficult transition from crisis government to normal democratic government; we have seen for ourselves that without martial law and even with normal representative government, we can effectively administer the affairs of government. Political will has not deserted us. Leadership has gained from the strengthening of the Batasang Pambansa and the reorganization of the various offices in the executive power and, for that matter, the ongoing reorganization of the judiciary.\r\nWhat we have demonstrated in terms or strengthening the very structure of government, as provided for in Section 5 of Article XVII, which mandates that we should give priority to the reorganization of the government, we have matched with a new sense of sovereignty and fulfillment, of achievement, and independence in our relations with the rest of the world.\r\nWe have looked at the various dimensions of this activity and we have come to the conclusion that finally and at last, we have attained authentic sovereignty for our people and our country. [\r\n]\r\nIn addition to foreign policy, which too many observers and writers is the real measure of a nation\u2019s sovereignty and independence, we have written a Constitution not directed and ordered by a foreign congress but by a Filipino congress. The 1967 Congress mandated and ordered by legislation the calling of a constitutional convention, the members of which were elected in 1970. The 1973 Constitution was approved by a Filipino president. [\r\n]\r\nYou will remember that in December of 1972, the then presiding officer of the constitutional convention presented to me the final draft of the Philippine Constitution of 1972 at Maharlika Hall with the suggestion that I now submit this to the people for ratification. That Constitution was then submitted to the Filipino people for ratification. The 1935 Constitution was a constitution which was designed to apply not only to a commonwealth that was a semi-independent form of government, but to the republic that was to be organized after a 10-year period of preparation. But this Constitution of 1973\u2014I say 1973 for it was in that year that if was ratified by our sovereign people\u2014is a constitution that applies to the new Philippine Republic alone. [\r\n]\r\nThe past 10 years will be remembered as a period when the foreign policy of our country came into its own, when we irrevocably broke our long confinement to the vision of the world in terms of the Cold War, when we opened ties with the Communist and Socialist world, when we made common cause with the nations of the Third World, when we forged the breakthrough with our Southeast Asian neighbors towards the building of a regional community, the ASEAN, and when we attained a place of pride and influence in the councils of nations.\r\nAnd thus, we attained what we have referred to as authentic sovereignty. But more than this, there was a question raised by Attorney-General Brownell of the United States as to the sovereignty of the Philippines over the American bases. We immediately wiped out any doubt about this, and we entered into the Ford-Marcos Agreement in order that sovereignty of the Philippines over these bases may be recognized, and that these bases may be known not as American bases but Philippine military bases, with only one flag over them, the Philippine flag, and one commander, a Filipino commander. [\r\n]\r\nAlthough we had participated in the Cold War, I visited the People\u2019s Republic of China and established diplomatic relations in 1975, and the Soviet Union in 1976, and almost established diplomatic relations with all the satellites of the Eastern European countries before or after that.\r\nAfter having sought to establish authentic sovereignty, we then proceeded towards the attainment of individual self-liberation of the Filipino. I shall not go into the details of the economic and social indicators, the highlights of economic and social development during this eventful decade of change which are quite well known to you. If they have distributed the printed copy of my speech, they probably are in that printed copy. They probably have not because you would be following me if they distributed it while I was delivering it; but you will get it. These are all discussed in previous speeches that I have delivered.\r\nSuffice it to say that, in the income of the farmer, for instance, we saw it not only doubled but triplicates because of the agrarian reform, the Masagana 99, the package of reforms that we have adopted, and because of the fact that the entire program of government was aimed at not just growth per se\u2014growth meaning the increase statistically of the gross national income\u2014but rather development, which means the distribution of growth among all citizens of the Republic.\r\nEnumerated in the printed version of my report to the Batasan, which you will get are the details of such a report.\r\nIn this spirit, we shall face the new agenda of government.\r\nThe world today is reeling from the onslaught of economic crisis and uncertainty. And this is what I would like to talk about for what is true with the world is also true with our country. But as we have done in the past, we will not allow the present crisis to paralyze and immobilize us.\r\nUnemployment today is a major concern; although the national unemployment rate remains a manageable 5% according to the Ministry of Labor\u2014and I have no reason to doubt these data and statistics\u2014the unemployment rate in Metropolitan Manila, however, has gone up to 12%.\r\nThe reasons for this are plain. Many industries are closed or closing down. Some of the copper and gold mining industries have closed or were closing. And they were going to cause the unemployment of an additional 40,000 workers who were threatened to be laid off. Atlas and Marcopper\u2014two big mining companies\u2014were losing money. I understand Marcopper was losing $120 million a year, and they could not continue until the government started to assume some of their losses.\r\nIn other industries the picture is the same. Recessive trends are a fact. Yet, there are those in our labor ranks who are restive and are pressing for a major hike in minimum wages and wag increases at a time when businesses are retrenching and struggling to stay afloat. While in other countries, unions are voluntarily abandoning their wage demands and are now beginning to play their role in the effort at economic recovery, there are those among us who press for wage increases now. And they do not care what the consequences may be.\r\nAnd so I say with caution to them: No one has been as sensitive to your demands and has extended the strong arm of support of the presidency than the incumbent President of the Republic of the Philippines. But today, I say to you, your demands are unrealistic. Our priority at this point must center on employment of those without jobs. The welfare of labor, may I say again, is my abiding obsession. But our attention at this point must be riveted on the saving of jobs, in creating job opportunities, and in keeping incomes of workers in pace with the cost of living.\r\nI am inclined to believe that perhaps the charges of some of the labor leaders to the effect that their ranks are being infiltrated by subversives need to be studied well and intensively. I hereby direct, therefore, the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of National Defense to participate in an effort to determine how true these charges are\u2014of subversives infiltrating the legitimate ranks of labor.\r\nI ask and appeal to all my friends in the labor sector to understand that while we could have utilized the heavy hand of the law against those who have indiscriminately, sometimes libelously, spoken against both government as well as the private sector, knowing fully well the truth about the situation, we have not done so. This has been so because I believe that you and I can sit down in accordance with the tradition of democratic dialogue and prove to the world that if the American labor unionist and the Japanese labor unionist can give up his increases in wages or even reduce his wages in order to keep industry moving and alive, the Filipino cannot be any less patriotic.\r\nI appeal to each and everyone; I appeal to management to continue the operation of business in order that we may not add to the unemployment figures of our country. Government shall participate in this effort. It shall pick up the bill or the tab to the extent that it is capable of doing so. But at the same time, I reiterate, let us sit down and work out a solution to this almost intractable problem.\r\nAnd so we have thought of a centerpiece that would create more jobs for everyone and increase their income\u2014the Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran\u2014to provide for the gainful employment of our labor force which grows by 643,000 every year. This national livelihood program envisions the creation of more jobs so that people may partake of their rightful share of the fruits of development with pride and with dignity because they share in the burdens of development.\r\nLet me congratulate all the agencies that have anything to do with the KKK, including the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and, of course, to a certain extent, I think, the Ministry of Human Settlements which is the KKK Secretariat\r\n[\r\n]\r\nEqually significant is the fact that KKK projects are spread all over the countryside. Three-fourths or a total of 2,914 of these new projects have been established in our rural communities.\r\nThe reaction of our people to the KKK has been nothing less than remarkable. There is virtually a hysterical demand today for the program to be spread to every nook and corner of the land.\r\nSection 5 of Article XVII further speaks of reorganizing the government. So, another major concern of both the Batasan and the political leadership must now be the full implementation of the reorganization measures especially the Judicial Reorganization Act which the Batasang Pambansa passed during the last regular session.\r\nThere has been no reorganization of the judiciary since the year 1901. Did I impress you with the fact that since 81 years ago our judiciary has not been reorganized? This, in itself, underlines the magnitude of the reforms that are needed.\r\nWe need, first, institutional reforms, meaning the restructuring of our courts. Secondly, we need a sweeping revamp of the personnel in the judiciary, principally aimed at restoring the competence and integrity of the bench. We need more judges and prosecutors, but just as badly, we need better men of the law to serve the cause of justice. And, finally, we need to revise the Rules of Court.\r\nNow, with respect to this, I shall be less than candid if I did not acknowledge that our full obligation to the Filipino people under the mandate of the Constitution under Sections 5 and 6 of the Transitory Provisions has yet to be fulfilled. The executive and legislative branches are responsible, as a single force for national development, for the formulation of a sustained legislative program to complete as soon as possible our remaining tasks. Now, the power of amending the Rules of Court of our judiciary is initially in the hands of the Supreme Court. In 1975, they all started to create a committee to amend the Rules of Court. This is the year 1982. May I appeal to the members of the Supreme Court who are here present to now help us cut down on the backlog of more than 450,000 cases still pending decision in the courts? They have been pending decision for years and years, and our people have almost lost hope that those cases would ever reach the day when they will be decided upon by the judiciary. [\r\n]\r\nIt is not my intention to impose upon the Supreme Tribunal, which has always performed its task with outstanding brilliance and efficiency. I am aware that they are overworked like us also, like the members of the Batasang Pambansa. [\r\n] I am aware that there is a difference of opinion on many matters pertaining to the Rules of Court. Accordingly, therefore, I have asked the help of retired chief justices and former justices of the Supreme Court. May I ask that I now be permitted to call an informal meeting in order that we can determine what we should do, whether the Supreme Court should allow the Batasang Pambansa to exercise its reserve power to amend the Rules of Court and wipe out the 450,000 cases pending before the courts. [\r\n]\r\nIt is may hope that the Batasang Pambansa members will help me in this very difficult situation.\r\nGoing back to the constitutional mandate under which we are being guided right now and from which we started way back in 1978, let us see what those mandate are:\u00a0First, we should give priority to the measures for the reorganization of the government; second, the standardization of the compensation of government employees; third, eradication of graft and corruption; fourth, effective maintenance of peace and order; fifth, full implementation of the agrarian reform that we have instituted; and finally, more measures to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.\r\nAnd, of course, in Section 6, we are supposed to reapportion the membership of the National Assembly in accordance with the last census. The last census was finished in 1980. The appointment bills have been pending before the Batasang Pambansa since 1980. But, of course, I know that you are very busy. I merely wish to remind you that you will have to make this apportionment because you are facing reelection in 1984. [\r\n] And that election happens to occur in May of 1984. So may I call attention to the fact that you have barely 12 months to finish this long list of tasks that are provided for and mandated in the Constitution.\r\nNow, among the specific measures we must pass into law are proposed amendments to the Election Code. Do we or do we not allow transfer to parties? And if we do, under what conditions? You will remember that we have amended this in the Constitution. Under the old Constitution, it was absolutely prohibited for any member of any party to transfer from his party to any other party. And we amended it by saying, \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law\u2026\u201d So you are now under the gun, and the question that is asked of you is, \u201cWill you provide by law for the transfer of politicians from one party to another?\u201d\r\nThen, there are the amendments to the Anti-Graft Law. According to the Sandiganbayan, it is necessary that we amend the law creating the Sandiganbayan so that the law on parole and indeterminate sentence will not apply to those who are convicted in the Sandiganbayan.\r\nThe Education Code, too. I notice that some of the teachers are complaining about the Education Code. I am surprised that at this late hour when the code is pending on Third Reading they come out with new claims.\r\nNow, with regard to the reorganization of the judiciary, the Batasang Pambansa must, I repeat, look into participating not only in the reformation of the Rules of Court, but in the matter of the choice of the personnel of various courts. I have already spoken of the Rules of Court and I shall not continue to speak of these further.\r\nThe Agrarian Reform laws are five in number. They were all referred to the Minister of Agrarian Reform and I presume that they are pending with the Committee on Agrarian Reform here in the Batasang Pambansa. The Minister of Agrarian Reform will take note of the fact that he does not have very much time if he intends to conduct public hearings on these five particular subjects.\r\nOn the matter of peace and order, it is my intention to call a meeting of the military and the civil government as soon as possible. I direct the military under the Minister of National Defense to undertake or be prepared to submit a presentation as soon as possible in order that I can bring about coordination in accordance with this mandate of the Constitution.\r\nAnd finally and at last, the reallocation of the seats in the Batasang Pambansa. The matter of the reappointment of seats in this Assembly in accordance with the Constitution, of course, has long been pending. But I remember that when I was a member of the Congress, we attempted to reapportion the seats in that Congress during that entire period which was quite a long while\u2014I was a member of Congress for about 15 years\u2014and we did not succeed in approving a reapportionment law. Remember that\u2014for 15 years\u2014and when we did, it was knocked down by the Supreme Court because of the Cavite gerrymandering which I propose you avoid in this particular study. I urge action on this issue now in order to make our Parliament truly representative of our people.\r\nNow, let me conclude with a short statement. It has been our experience, arising from the workings of our parliamentary system of government or modified parliamentary system of government, that the executive and the legislative will of our government is not divided but united; that consensus and understanding favorable to speedy progress in legislation is possible. And we do not neglect the salutary role that an alternative voice in this Assembly performs in the evaluation of policies and programs that we propose.\r\nIn this spirit, permit me to respond to a recent call to a moral revolution that has emanated from the ranks of the opposition. Of course, this not the first time that I heard it. I welcome this suggestion. Now, in talking about moral revolution, I may say that perhaps they are a few years late, for this is the thing that I articulated the moment that we proclaimed the New Society. And, again, almost every year during the last 10 years. For I have always said that any revolution, even a violent revolution, is not an authentic revolution if it does not include the dimensions of a moral revolution. The beginning of the program of national transformation 10 years ago and the shaping of the very ideology and philosophy of government that we espoused was based on moral change. In the pages of my book,\r\n, I presented the following view, and may I quote:\r\nA revolution may survive any political or economic error but not a moral one. A revolution without a humanist dimension is merely a struggle for material things. We are struggling for more than the rice in our bellies and the clothes on our backs. We are fighting for our pride as a nation and as individual human beings.\r\nOur conception of the \u201cmoral revolution\u201d proceeds from a rigorous recognition of inequalities that exist in society, inequities that we must first extirpate, and of the need to strike them down so there can be no debate whatsoever. We see it as a dimension that must attend the very struggle for development: Wealth must be democratized and benefits must be shared.\r\nWe can agree that there is need to restudy today the dimensions of moral revolution. Now more than ever\u2014and this is why I welcome this discussion\u2014there is need to uphold and defend the trust of public oath, to reinforce the place of ethics in the private sector, to uphold ourselves to the egalitarian goals of our society, and to read once again even the Constitution which speaks of public accounting.\r\nIt is, however, one of the grave distortions of the times we live in that occasionally we ourselves commit this error that we speak of moral order and yet at the same time justify with the same breath the morality of violence of both words and deeds.\r\nThere are many instances of leaders, perhaps not just of the opposition but leaders of all cloth, engaging or encouraging terrorism and revolutionary activities. I make this appeal to them now. I appeal to the members of the opposition, especially those against whom the military and the Ministry of National Defense has evidence, to restore the democratic dialogue in our country and to eschew the use of violence in any or by any means whatsoever.\r\nWe welcome the invitation to restudy the moral dimensions of a revolution. But kidnapping and assassination often do not arise out of a misunderstanding of morality and moral standards. They are often the products of the use of terrorism and violence by political opponents.\r\nWe fully believe that the vitality of our national life derives in part from creative and reasoned debate, and from the participation of all in the reconstruction of our society. We believe, however, that there are times when men from both sides of the camp\u2014both the opposition and the majority\u2014forget that they speak for higher clientele and constituency than just those who voted for them; and that is, the universal concepts of ethics, honesty, and accepted principles of morality, and that, therefore, when we speak of moral dimension of a revolution, we speak of a common loyalty. But this must be the work of both legitimate opposition as well as of the majority party.\r\nWe ask the opposition, therefore, to remember that the party in power will try as best as it can to accommodate them in public and open debate, for this is a government modified by parliamentary means and not by the mindless recourse to violence.\r\nWe know we can never think alike amid the dilemmas and problems of our changing world, nor should we welcome the robotlike acceptance of the thoughts coming from a single leader; that would be catastrophic and tragic. \u201cOpinion striking against opinion,\u201d it is said, \u201cignites the spark that kindles the lamp of truth.\u201d If we honor this process of reasoned debate and contention, our differences will never destroy our underlying unity as a nation, and our disputes will not leave us embittered or unkind.\r\nThere is no single forum in the whole of our government and our country which more fully exemplifies this process of a dialogue in our country than this, the Batasang Pambansa, the interim National Assembly. And it is here where we shape the course of our country and our nation, the course of the ship of state.\r\nWe are not rivals but partners in a common enterprise, and we are called upon by duty as representatives of the sovereign will of our people to lead in the fulfillment of national hopes and aspirations.\r\nAs we open this Fifth Regular Session of the Batasang Pambansa, we are fully aware that the times will test to the full the probity of our insights into the state of national life today and the validity of our answers to the problems we face.\r\nBut we also share, I believe, this common faith that we have weathered the storms before, and so will we again. And when I say \u201cwe,\u201d I mean all of us, whether we belong to the majority or the opposition.\r\nThank you and good day\r\n[\r\n]", "title": "State-of-the-Nation Address"},
{"delivered": "1980-07-28 17:57:59+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 28, 1980]\r\n\r\nIt is the custom at the opening of the annual session of our young parliament for the President and Prime Minister to address himself here to a review of the year just concluded and to set before this Assembly the government\u2019s program of legislation for the year now beginning.\r\nWith your permission, I shall depart from the stricture of custom, and shall instead endeavor to look at the state of the nation from the larger per\u00adspective of the decades of those that are now past, and the one that now confronts us\u2014the decades of the 60s and the 70s and the 80s up to the 90s and the end of our century.\r\nFor this is what the times impel us to review and ponder here today. At no other time than now has it ever been more necessary for our people to understand the course of the nation\u2014from where we have come and where we are going.\r\nThere is today a disturbing mood of disquiet and I confusion that neither reflects the real challenges nor befits the peoples of the world who have surmounted many dangers in the years just past.\r\nOvernight, the world has become suddenly do\u00adminated by rumors and wracked by self-doubt. Overnight, there appears to have occurred an erosion of self-confidence, which was once the fount of dynamism, in spite of the many crises that have beset the whole world.\r\nIn all my 15 years as President of our Republic, I have never delivered a message to the legislature under such a fever of speculation and conjecture as that which shadows my appearance here today, except perhaps in the year 1970 about which I am reminded as I take this rostrum.\r\nBy this I do not mean the healthy examination and debate that should and must go on in the confrontation of those issues vital to national life in all democratic states. Nor do I make light of the fact that we live in times of profound challenge and uncertainty. Rather I am speaking of the sickly anxiety that seems to have overtaken most nations, as they view the course of developments abroad and reflect on their impact at home. I am speaking of the creeping defeatism that has perceptibly reared its head again among peoples of the world. And in the Philippines I am speaking of the pre\u00addictable efforts of those who all these years have never shared the burden of effort with our people and have instead shirked their citizens\u2019 duties and devoted their time wholly to the sowing of confusion and the undermining of the efforts of government.\r\nThe world has heard these voices before, of course, and history has found and proven them false.\r\nLet us get our perspectives right and straight. Demagoguery has never solved problems. Inaction, immobility, and fearful cowering in hesitancy or procrastination have always ended in tragedy, individual as well as national.\r\nIn what we truly confront today, we do not face anything new or alien to our experience as a people.\r\nThere are for us only two ways of viewing the government\u2019s duty in matters affecting our econo\u00admic and social life today.\r\nThe first counsels us towards halting the pro\u00adgrams, inaction, postponing decisions, and adopting half measures that are mere palliatives reminiscent of our past responses to problems, which falsely place at centerstage painkillers in lieu of real me\u00addicines for the disease in the hope that problems will wear themselves out and that the situation will return to normal. These measures make the claim of shielding the people from the onslaughts of cri\u00adsis, but in fact succeed only in prolonging and deepening the nation\u2019s state of embattlement. This course of action belongs to the past and to the party of reaction and opposition, which historically has never provided the nation with any sense of leadership, especially in a time of crisis.\r\nOur philosophy of government, a radical departure from the old notions of powers and authority, has been most evident in our single-minded obsession with development planning.\r\nBasically, we have addressed ourselves to ful\u00adfilling three overriding objectives:\r\nBecause we live today seven years removed from the conditions of national life at the beginning of the seventies, many of us tend to falsely assume that the many things that now dominate the na\u00adtional landscape and characterize the state of the nation have always been with us. Yet the plain truth is that we have written during the last seven years perhaps the greatest success story in our en\u00adtire national history.\r\nLet me then review in outline form this story of our socioeconomic and political development. If I tend to stick to figures, perhaps it is because I am excited by figures, all kinds of figures. There is nothing, however, more fascinating than that par\u00adticular figure, the figure of economic development. This fascinates, this turns me on.\r\nLet us go back to 1965. In 1965 what was the gross national product in real terms? It was P39.5 billion. In 1979 the country\u2019s GNP stood at a re\u00admarkable P86.7 billion, also in real terms. It re\u00adpresents a healthy growth rate of 6.6% a year. Our critics keep claiming that our growth rate has been kept from 2% to 5%. In 1980 the esti\u00admates placed GNP at P220 billion at current rates, four times the 1972 GNP level.\r\nBut how is this reflected in the individual citi\u00adzen\u2019s income? How does it affect his personal in\u00adcome? In general terms, we can say that in 1965 the per capita income stood at P736, and this reach\u00aded P1,133 in 1970 and P1,428 in 1972; but as of the end of 1979 real per capita income, measured at constant 1972 prices, amounted to P1,862; at cur\u00adrent figures, P4,630. This year the per capita in\u00adcome is expected to increase further to P5,874 or $780\u2015a fivefold increase! This merely means that measured as of 1970 prices, the average income of every individual in the Philippines is not merely doubled and trebled, but quintupled.\r\nYet we kept hearing the repeated canard that the New Society has merely tended to the rich and not to the poor. A review of the sectoral averages in income shows a more dramatic picture.\r\nWe have converted a grain-deficit country to a rice-surplus-and-exporting country. What does this mean to the individual Filipino? To the indivi\u00addual farmer, it means an increase in the average rice yield per hectare of from 30 cavans to 60 cavans in the first five years and from 60 to 90 in the latter years. The income of the farmer not only increased twice or three times; in some, instances, it has qua\u00addrupled.\r\nWe do not need to speak of \u201cMasagana 99\u201d nor the political will that went into the program for rice sufficiency, nor the participation of each and every citizen in every socioeconomic and political program of our country. However, let me say that in 1965 our farmers harvested only 4.3 million tons of rice and that in 1972 production had risen slight\u00adly to 5.1 million metric tons. But last year\u2019s pro\u00adduction was 7.25 million metric tons. And this was the achievement of a people barehanded and with limited resources.\r\nIn other food crops such as fish, corn, coffee, they contributed their share in the increase of our total crop production from 12.2 million metric tons in 1965 to last year\u2019s production of 24.4 million metric tons\u2014an exact doubling of productivity dur\u00ading the entire period under review.\r\nNeither should it be necessary to speak of the increasing investments. From 1972 to 1979, in\u00advestments rose at a healthy rate of 27.5%, from P11.6 billion in 1972 to P63.4 billion in 1979. Of this, foreign investments represented a vital percentage. To show the dramatic change in the busi\u00adness climate, in 1965, investments amounted to only P4.9 billion in its entirety. Let us take one sector alone. In 1979, applications solely for completely new industrial projects totaled more than one-half of the entire investments in 1965 and 1972. In 1970 local participation in investments was limited to about 50% of the entire investment. Today local participation, meaning Filipino participation, in investments, especially in industrial investments, has increased to 75%. This merely means that the individual Filipino has claimed successfully his rightful share of the industrial development of this country.\r\nIt is also said that the multinationals gobble up all economic opportunities, and this, they claimed, means that the multinationals have been permitted and licensed to rob the Filipino people of their right\u00adful share of income and profit. Is this true? This is not supported by the data and statistics. When I took over as President, the only exports of the Philippines were the four traditional products that you and I know about at that time: sugar, coconut products, mineral ores, and forest products. They constituted about 85% of the entire export products of the country. There were no manufac\u00adtures or semimanufactures, to speak of, exports coming from the Philippines. Or if there were, they contributed a meager, according to the data, 6.7% in 1972 to such exports. But by 1979 they were contributing 34%.\r\nWe have changed the complexion, therefore, of our exports; diversified our markets; and now we have such items sold to other countries like elec\u00adtronic and transport components, chemicals, wood\u00adcrafts, garments, and handicrafts.\r\nBut if we are to limit our study to industrial growth, we see a more outstanding performance instead of the 6.4% growth recorded from 1967 to 1972. I refer to the record of industrial growth in the latter part of the 70s, when it ave\u00adraged an annual growth rate of 8.3%. And this will no doubt increase even more dramatically with the acceleration of the momentum of industrialization which we have set as a program, espe\u00adcially with the 11 chosen basic factories and industries we are developing.\r\nSuffice it to say that there is also another aspect which we find dramatic, and that is tourism. It is a sector well known to you. We have inched for\u00adward close to the 1 million tourists mark, bringing in earnings close to $250 million annually from this nontrade dollar-earner.\r\nAnd the infrastructure, which is the basis of our economic planning, shows a quantum leap. In 1965 the existing road network totalled 55,544 kilo\u00admeters. By 1972, we had increased it to 77,278 kilometers. Today a system of 129,186 kilometers of highways and access roads joins our remotest barrios to the centers of commerce and population. The entire system can now be said to be linked from the north to the south, island to island.\r\nTo further ease the movement of people and commodities, we have increased our airports from 140 to 199; seaports from 622 to 849, with 60 sea\u00adports being expanded and improved to receive for\u00adeign shipping.\r\nOne of the sectors that needs further improve\u00adment is communication facilities and network. But certainly there has been a great increase. During the seven-year period under review, there have been installed 33 rural telephone exchanges, 32 telegraph telex stations, 795 telegraph stations, and 424 ra\u00addio stations; there have been organized 29 regional postal centers and 336 new post offices.\r\nOver the brief span of seven years we managed to build as many irrigation systems or, rather, irrigation systems that water as much an area as is equal or more than that covered by all the irrigation systems that were constructed since the beginning of the Spanish regime in 1521; so that today our irrigated areas total 1.3 million hectares, a little bit more. Some of the data speak of 104 million hectares\u2014compared to the original 616,000 hectares in 1970 and 300,000 in 1965.\r\nThere are some outstanding engineering con\u00adstructions which we can refer to like Pantabangan, which irrigates 78,000 hectares and generates 100 megawatts of power as well as mitigate floods in the lower reaches of the Pampanga River.\r\nThe Magat River Multi-Purpose Project in Isa\u00adbela, the biggest of its kind in the Philippines and perhaps in Southeast Asia, will irrigate 113,000 hectares in Cagayan Valley and, more importantly, generates 540 megawatts of power to augment the capacity of the Luzon grid, thereby reducing our dependence on oil, especially on foreign oil.\r\nIn the 60s, construction of schoolrooms was at the rate of only 1,000 rooms a year. In 1972 we immediately boosted construction of schoolrooms to a high rate of 6,000 a year. By 1979 we increased this to 13,000 a year.\r\nOne accomplishment which signals the new de\u00adcade of the 70s is the rural electrification program. Before there was barely any electrification in the rural areas, but at the end of 1979 there were elec\u00adtrical connections to a million-and-a-half houses, servicing more than 8 million of our people, all of them in the rural areas. A total of 113 co\u00adoperatives were organized in the Visayas and Min\u00addanao and the program is so successful that the United States and some developing countries have honored us by pointing to the Philippines as a model for rural electrification in developing countries. [\r\n]\r\nThe question is often asked: How does the com\u00admon man share in the fruits of economic develop\u00adment? Has development contributed to the social well-being of our people?\r\nThe answer to these questions is an unqualified \u201cyes.\u201d The income of the lowest 21% of our country\u2019s population has more than doubled from 2.5% of the total in 1965 to 5.5% in 1975 and certainly in 1979 this has further accelerated.\r\nHow about employment? At what rate have we increased the employment of our people? I speak of the rate of employment. The period from 1965 to 1972 was marked by an employment rate of 2.3%. The period under review, 1972 to 1979, shows that the employment rate increased to 4.2%.\r\nOn the other hand, unemployment and under\u00ademployment went down to 5.1% and 10.9% during the last seven years, as compared to the high rates of 17% and 23% over the 1965-1972 period. Within the 80s we expect to bring down the unemployment rate further to 4%. Perhaps we should call attention to the fact that even in the United States unemployment some\u00adtimes reaches as high as 8%.\r\nIt will be noted parenthetically here that our population program has succeeded in reducing the high growth rate from 3.01% as of the close of the 60s to 2.38% as of the end of 1979.\r\nOften repeated is the claim that the value of the peso has been so eroded that the minimum wage is minimal. Is this correct? Let me clarify the figures. In 1970, the minimum wage was P8.00. Assuming that there has been a reduction by as much as 60 or 70% in the purchasing cap\u00adability or value of our currency, therefore, there \u00adshould be doubling or a trebling of the minimum wage in order to catch up with the value of the peso in 1972 or 1970. It has not only trebled; it has reached P26.38 as of this year. If counted on the basis of the value of the peso, the P8.00 of 1972 would be equivalent to about P19 today. It is ob\u00advious, therefore, that the present minimum wage of P26.38 exceeds the value of the take-home pay of wage-earners in 1970 by P7.00.\r\nTo fight unemployment, we have encouraged the development of skilled and semiskilled labor, and have allowed these workers to work overseas. Those abroad, 500,000 of them, earned for their families and the country a total of more than $1 billion every year.\r\nIn social services, particularly in health and nutrition, we have made significant headway. The life span of Filipinos has increased from 58 years in 1970 to 62 years in 1980, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 66 per thousand from 80 per thousand.\r\nCalorie intake has increased from 83.6 to 88.6% in 1978. Greater protein intake has also been noted from 94.5% to 102%.\r\nThe nutrition program of the Philippines, in\u00adcidentally, has been adopted as a model by the United Nations for all Third World countries, and the Phil\u00adippines has become a part of the United Nations University. [\r\n]\r\nEvery year there is an increase in the number of pupils who are accommodated in our school sys\u00adtem. In 1979-1980, enrollment was about 9 million. This year, 1980, there are 12.2 million pupils en\u00adrolled. The literacy rate has been increased to 88.9% this year from 83.4% 10 years ago. In Manila, the literacy rate is almost 100%.\r\nI point out these facts because it is not well known how much we subsidize education in our country. Not only do we give free elementary and secondary education; we grant educational benefits to state institutions. For the University of the Philippines alone, let it be noted that we have pro\u00advided yearly a subsidy of P5,000 for every student except for the College of Medicine where we provide P18,000 per student annually.\r\nI need not perhaps refer to the Human Settlements and the BLISS project have been looked upon by most of our people as their last hope to own a home. They find a blossoming of that hope for a home, and not just for a home but for a source of livelihood for it is the goal of the Human Settlements Ministry that it does not merely offer an empty dwelling but also provide a decent means of livelihood for idle people.\r\nI have not spoken to you of the other important programs, the projects of national development which, however, are founded on peace and order. All I can say is, that not only have the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the defense establish\u00adment established the atmosphere which allows the continued implementation of all these ambitious programs but, at the same time, we must also com\u00admend our citizenry all over the country for they have taken it upon themselves to cooperate and extend support to the Armed Forces. Indeed, never in the history of this country have the soldiers of this nation been truly the armed forces of the citizens of the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nThere are 100,000 men in uniform, more, but they are not mentioned in exact number. Add to this are about 70,000 policemen and about an equal number of local militia, the home defense units.\r\nThere are bound to be scoundrels in any group of men, especially in such a number of men who are taught the art of killing. In such a large group of men, of course, there is need to clean the ranks and we are happy to note that the citizenry, for once, are participating in the efforts to clean the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and have given their cooperation, understanding, and sym\u00adpathy, which has allowed the Armed Forces to work out its program not only as guardians of our security but also as participants in the economic develop\u00adment program.\r\nAs I review the achievements of the Armed Forces, the police as well as the others, I see many weaknesses, many failures, yes, but I shudder to think what would have happened to the Republic of the Philippines and to its citizenry had we not taken the steps necessary to utilize the Armed Forces, not to take over the civil government but to strengthen the civil government of the Republic of the Philip\u00adpines in 1972. We established a crisis government, for if we had taken the counsel of fear and delayed action, it would have been too late to save the Republic. Let us look around us and we see the lessons taught by such countries, like Kampuchea, with its people of about 4 million reduced to 2 million by war, disease, internal fighting through the wrong decisions of their leaders and their people. We see the same lesson in Africa, South America.\r\nI observe that today it is becoming fashionable once again to talk disparagingly of the man in uniform.\r\nWe hesitate to speak in defense of our Armed Forces and our police even if they are in the right. We hesitate to speak for our security; we hesitate to speak for the men who place at the disposal of the Republic their lives and their properties and their honor. And we expect from them the utmost vigilance, dedication, patriotism, and heroism. The economic development program of our Republic in Mindanao is possible only because of the heroic ef\u00adforts of that armed force and of the civilians who have fought for the peace and order of that por\u00adtion of our country. For we must bring back to the mainstream of our political and economic life the members of our Muslim community.\r\nWe hesitate to adopt the social services program and the health program which are both for the good of the ordinary Filipino. We hesitate to provide funds for the necessary projects found in the budget. What was the level of our funding in the budget?\r\nLet me give you some facts. From a level of P2.7 billion in 1965 and P6.3 billion in 1972, the national budget grew to P42.2 billion in 1979. Com\u00adparing the seven-year period, there was an annual growth rate of 12.9% over the 1965-1972 period and a 31.2% increase over the 1972-\u00ad1979 period.\r\nSo, how did we spend these budgetary alloca\u00adtions? In 1965, 85% of the budget was spent for what is known as operating or current ex\u00adpenditures. This actually means the salaries and services of employees, and only 15% of the entire budget was spent for capital outlays like roads, bridges, irrigation systems, and schoolhouses.\r\nWe have now reversed these. In 1979 operating expenditures were drastically reduced from 85% to 63.5% and the greater amount or, rather, what was not spent for the services and salaries is now being spent for investment and capital outlays, capital outlays which, of course, were critical to the national development effort. This is a shift which all must understand, a shift towards more development budgeting, which is the reason for the growth in the economic capacity of the common man during the seven-year period, 1972 to 1979.\r\nWith a longer-term perspective of what the rest of the 1980s has to offer and with confidence in the program of our government, we should seize the moment to act while we have the time and while we have the capability.\r\nThis is the course that I now commend to the support of the Batasan.\r\nWe shall be submitting forthwith for the imme\u00addiate deliberation of this body our proposed budget program for calendar year 1981.\r\nIn the proposed National Budget, we seek the wherewithal to carry through with this strategy of accelerated development in this time of challenge to the nation.\r\nWe have strived to embody in the General Ap\u00adpropriations Bill a program of expenditures to match the program of development and to meet the urgent problems of the day.\r\nWith one eye turned to the difficulties of the times and the other to the need to build bridges to a better future, we have sought to make the budget flexible and resilient, so that we can respond to the new and the unknown that will face us in the coming year and so that we can fund activities that will steadily strengthen national stability and enhance national productivity.\r\nTotal outlays are proposed at P54.8 billion for 1981, representing an increase of P13 billion over the budget for the year 1980. Current and capital expenditures will constitute P53.1 billion, while debt repayments are projected at P1.7 billion. Receipts are anticipated to grow and reach a total of P45.3 billion. Some 15% of expenditures, or about P8 billion, represent the budgetary deficit that must be supported by net borrowings.\r\nIt will be seen upon examination of the budget program and from the totality of our program of government for the decade of the 80s that it is our conscious policy to steer away from facile and illu\u00adsory solutions and to embrace instead the strategies and programs that will confront the basic problems.\r\nWe ambitiously invest in an accelerated energy development program because we are confident of its success. I have ordered that we now spend every year, for the next five years, a total of P5 billion, a doubling of the original program, for we must accelerate our development of the renew\u00adable indigenous sources of energy. And because this promises our true deliverance from the energy crises, we are committed to it. We espouse in\u00adcreased production and improved productivity, both in agriculture and industry, because these are the true and lasting solutions to inflation and the trade imbalance.\r\nWe continue to stress infrastructure develop\u00adment, knowing from experience their vital import\u00adance to the acceleration of the economic effort.\r\nFinally, we propose special attention to the quality and scope of social services to the 11 basic needs of man to ensure that our develop\u00adment will meet the test of social justice and democ\u00adratization.\r\nIt is therefore my privilege to now ask of the Batasan its support for this budget program and for its continued commitment to our entire program of the decade of the 80s. [\r\n]\r\nOccasionally, we forget our objectives and tar\u00adgets. Let us devote our talents and time to the decisive issues of our day. Let us not be diverted from them by marginal, even if apparently popular, issues.\r\nIt is time to make some changes in both the Cabinet and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It is my intention to consult the members of the Batasang Pambansa before I make such changes.\r\nWe must simplify and rationalize further the tax system of the Philippines. For the present, there should be no additional tax on oil products. [\r\n]\r\nFor the present, we must depend upon greater efficiency in the tax collecting arms of the government and, in addition, simplify and strengthen these organizations.\r\nThe trisectoral conference on income and wages must meet as soon as the oil prices are decided upon. We must reduce some of the taxes. We can start right now with an announcement that the highest rate of personal income tax is 70%. It is my intention to see to it that this is reduced to 60%. [\r\n] But more than this, it is now necessary to review the entire tax system, to see to it that the middle-income group and lower ranks of our people do not pay the same high rates, whether in income taxes or in indirect taxes, as do the owners of such big corporations like Ayala and San Miguel.\r\nWe must seriously consider a gross personal income tax. [\r\n] We must consider as part of our program a study of a simplified cap\u00adital gains tax privilege especially for stock market operations.\r\nBut we must give additional incentives to the officers and employees of the Bureaus of Internal Revenue and of Customs so that they may remain faithful to their trust.\r\nIn fairness to the BIR, may I say that in the year 1979 and 1980, so the record shows, there was an increase of P10 billion in collections. Of this, P1 billion was due to the increase in the rates of taxes but P9 billion was due to increased efficiency in tax collection. [\r\n]\r\nThe Ministry of Finance perhaps is due for congratulations for this, and so with the new leadership in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\r\nThere has also been an increase in the collections by the Bureau of Customs notwithstanding the fact that there has been a reduction in the volume of our exports\u2014in volume and value. Congratula\u00adtions are also due to the Bureau of Customs. [\r\n]\r\nSo, the Batasan must continue to give vitality to the basic political unit, the barangay. Through the barangays we have been able to harness the smallest citizen for both political and socioeconomic action. It has become the operational level of all our programs whatever such programs may be, be they security or economic.\r\nI take occasion, therefore, to congratulate the barangays, their leaders, and workers who have been instrumental in the success of our development program. Without them, all these achieve\u00adments that I speak of would not be there. The momentum must be maintained; the momentum of achievement must be kept. We cannot lose our orientation nor our inertia of achievement and progress.\r\nIt is inevitable that we choose the road of de\u00advelopment in meeting the challenges and uncer\u00adtainties of the times. For it will not do merely to state that the present crisis is rooted in circumstances beyond our control. It will not do to say that all nations are similarly beleaguered and embattled. Neither resolves the predicament in which we find ourselves.\r\nWe have made a tremendous start towards national development. To draw back now simply because certain factors seem inhospitable to efforts, or because greater demands will be made of all of us is to nurse the illusion that the future will be more propitious.\r\nBut this, at best, is an illusory hope. In the meantime, should we opt to wait, the costs of programs will irrevocably spiral and then again we shall be admonished to wait for a better time.\r\nI say \u201cno.\u201d This cannot be the course of the nation.\r\nThe burden of national leadership in a time such as this is to provide vision in the midst of uncertainty; to hold out hope and confidence when threats and difficulties appear to mount, when danger confronts us in the face, and to clear a path through which the people may find refuge and security.\r\nOut of this profound challenge to national life today, we ought to emerge as we did in the crises of the past, stronger in our resolve, surer of ourselves, and clearer in our purposes.\r\nThis is the historic charge of the party in which has been vested the mandate of the people: to provide direction, to give leadership, and to rally the nation to action. [\r\n]\r\nBut always we must be one in the advocacy of this program, this bold program of action. This is the legacy of this Batasan, whatever be the party to which we belong.\r\nAnd let it be the charge of the party in opposition to bring to the Batasan the light of its criticisms, so that we may then debate and discuss the policies, the programs, and the actions we propose to the nation. That, too, is their legacy.\r\nIn this spirit, I now commend the Batasan to its historic work.\r\nThank you and good day.", "title": "A Time of Challenge to the Nation"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Philippine International Convention Center, Manila, on September 21, 1976]\r\nIn accordance with the traditions of all legislative bodies, the Head of State or Head of Government submits a report to the nation at the opening session of its legislative body.\r\nTayo ay nagtagumpay upang mabuhay at makapanatili sa kabila ng sunud-sunod na krisis. Ang ating lipunan na noong araw ay pasama nang pasama, at tinangkang wasakin ng himagsikan o rebelyon may apat na taon lamang ang nakakaraan; ang balak na ihiwalay sa Republika ang Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu, at Tawi-tawi, gayundin ang kriminalidad at kaguluhang nakapamayani sa buong kapuluan, ay nasugpo sa pamamagitan ng pagsusumikap ng pamahalaan at ng lahat ng mamamayan. Ang bansa ay nakatatayo ngayon nang matatag at ang Bagong Lipunan ay may lakas upang humarap sa anumang kagipitan at ano mang pagbabago. Tayo\u2019y nagtagumpay, hindi sapagka\u2019t nalutas nating lahat ang ating mga suliranin o kundi sapagka\u2019t nabigyan natin ang ating buhay ng tiyak na hugis at direksiyon.\r\nGaya ng sinabi ko sa aking bagong aklat na tumatalakay sa Bagong Lipunan at ipamamahagi sa araw na ito:\r\nAng ating Bagong Lipunan na itinatag, una\u2019y para sa mga napabayaang mahihirap sa bayan-bayan, ay nabigyan ng pagkakataon sa mga magsasaka na kumita ng doble at triple. Nabawasan ang mga walang hanap-buhay. Noong 1972, 7% sa bansa ay walang hanapbuhay, ngunit ngayon ay mag-aapat na porsiento na lamang. Masasabi natin ngayon na ang ating mamamayan ay may sapat na pagkain at mga pangunahing pangangailangan, at ang kita naman ng pamahalaan ay tumaas mula sa P5 bilyon noong 1972 hanggang P23 bilyon sa taong ito. Ang ating gross national product o kabuuan ng produkto ng bansa sa taong ito ay inaasahang aabot sa pagitan ng 6 at 7%, at ang pinakamababa ay P45.792 bilyon at ang pinakamataas ay aabot sa P46.244 bilyon. Ang kabuuang kita naman ng bawa\u2019t tao ay lumaki rin. Naragdagan ang kumakalat na pera ng may 4.1% ngunit ang inflation o ang pagtaas ng mga halaga ng bilihin ay napigil sa 5.1%, makatapos ang pagtaas sa 40% noong 1974.\r\nToday, we stand proud as a nation. Today, we turn a page in history. We celebrate the fourth year of martial law with the first session of the Batasang Bayan. We have succeeded to survive and prevail over crisis after crisis. The deterioration of our society threatened by the rebellion four years ago, the secessionism in the south as well as the criminality and anarchy over the land were aborted through the exercise of political will.\r\nThe nation stands and the New Society exists, able to cope with adversity and vicissitudes. It has been a triumph not in the sense that we have solved all our problems, but that we have managed to give our national life a determined shape and direction. Our New Society, addressing itself to the neglected rural and urban poor, has enabled the farmers in some areas to double and in some areas to treble their income. Unemployment has considerably decreased\u2014from 7% in 1972 to 3.9% in the present year. Our people in general have become self-sufficient in staples, while government income has increased from P5.75 billion in 1972 to P22.4 billion this year. Our gross national product this year will grow between 6 to 7% between a low of P45.792 billion and a high of P46.244 billion. Per capital income has correspondingly increased. Money supply has grown to 4.1%, while inflation was held to an average 5.3% after the inflation rate reached 40% in 1974 and 1975. Progress has been brought about in a broad range of activities touching upon all facets of life of the Filipinos.\r\nWe have reorganized government not only to streamline its institutions, but to eliminate the inefficient and corrupt, the burdens of our bureaucracy, and the entire people.\r\nWe will continue this task unrelentingly. We have safeguarded the national fabric not only by dismantling the apparatus of rebellion and of the Rightist-Leftist conspiracy and by reducing the secessionist movement in the south and by eliminating the private armies and taking over illicitly owned or possessed firearms, but also by standing watch over still continuing efforts of subversion.\r\nWe have implemented the program of agrarian reform, now showing concrete reforms in countryside development. We have pursued our food production program and have achieved self-sufficiency in staple food products.\r\nThe strategy in the matter of insurgency and secession was and remain political in the sense that it follows the politics of integration rather than of conflict. We have attempted to show, and I believe succeeded in showing, that social, economic, political, and even cultural grievances can be redressed in a society based on the rebellion of the poor. As the insurgent and secessionist rebels are Filipinos, they can be rewon by a resurgent sense of nationality and renewed sense of society.\r\nThus, we have met the threats of sedition and secession, giving us time and opportunity for reconstruction. There is, moreover, added cost for national pride in our new standing in the world arising out of our economic management and our conduct of international relations. Our dollar reserves increased from $25 million in 1972 to $1.2 billion in 1976. On the other hand, investments have poured in from other countries.\r\nWe have moved forward, making considerable gains in areas where many other nations are meeting difficulty. We have arrested the drift and the internal collapse of our society and have recovered a new sense of direction and purpose, with the visible support of the majority. Where the claims of contending interests and ideologies previously threatened to rend apart our society, today we stand strong at the center, able to rationally reconcile differences, rationalize our decisions, and take determined, concerted actions. This we demonstrated in the recent tragedy that struck the coastal areas and cities of Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. With an important portion of our population suffering extensive destruction and the death of thousands of our population\u2014in the last report 8,000 were supposed to have perished\u2014we went into the work of relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction using mostly the resources generated within our own country by a people moving in united and concerted action. On different occasions, we have seen the same newly discovered capability at work, in varying scale and degree and according to the demands of the hour. It is very much with us today. For today, as peace, political stability, and economic growth remain elusive to most of the world at large, we create the beginning of a new department in our government, the Batasang Bayan. That new department, we hope, will be a legislate department. For it is my purpose that although the Batasang Bayan is considered as an advisory council, it shall act on almost all the important pieces of legislation required by our country. I shall exercise the power of legislation as mandated by the Constitution and the Supreme Court only when and if the Batasang Bayan cannot meet any given contingency.\r\nFrom September 1972 to the end of 1975, we achieved much more than in the previous 30 years.\r\nThis was the time when we began the social democratization of wealth.\r\nThis was the time when we entered the deeper consciousness of the Family of Nations, particularly our allies in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or the Third World.\r\nThis was the time when our economic performance attracted the attention of international financing institutions and investors, and the country crashed the international market for tourism.\r\nThis was the time when we went back to our historical roots in the development of our own indigenous political institutions.\r\nThis was the time when we committed the largest sums of our available resources to the socioeconomic development of the countryside, and industry, jobs, investments, credit, incomes, and education shifted to the great mass of our population in the rural areas.\r\nThis was the time when because of the adoption by decree of the long-shelved proposal in Congress for service contracts in oil drilling, we discovered oil, uranium, more gold deposits, geothermal power, and mineral deposits throughout the country.\r\nIn enforcing martial law, our most difficult task did not lie in immobilizing the enemies of the state, although that in it constituted a formidable task. Rather, it lay in giving a social dimension to all our efforts, so that the energies otherwise spent to spread anarchy and chaos would be transformed into a peaceful and productive force for the making of meaningful reforms.\r\nTherefore, instead of merely seeking to blunt the onslaught of insurgency and rebellion, to crush its armed organization, as we substantially did in the last several years, we sought to extirpate the conditions that sought to give meaning to the false attractions of such insurgency and rebellion.\r\nBeyond the need to fully restore public order, we sought to increase the level of public welfare.\r\nBeyond conserving resources from the crippling effects of global economic crisis\u2014such as the one in oil\u2014we sought their purposeful utilization in a determined bid to generate employment and incomes for millions of our people under the principle of dynamic flexibility.\r\nAnd beyond the piecemeal efforts toward social change that had marked our history since independence, we undertook bold programs to create and redistribute both wealth and opportunity, to dismantle the system of privilege that favored the rich and powerful, and to encourage the productive participation of millions.\r\nAll these called for resolute action, first, in the consolidation of the long-diffused and compromised authority of government; second, in the restoration of the basic bond between the people and their government, which had been distorted by a corrupt electoral process and a manipulative system of representation; and third in the reform of the entire machinery of government administration.\r\nGiven the authority to act decisively on any problem area with a minimum of red tape and waste of resources, we were able to implement programs whose thrust and magnitude had previously required more than the resources and energies of government. Thus, at the end of a four-year period, we could see the successful implementation of a number of integrated regional area projects, in addition to those that could only be national in scope, as they addressed themselves to broad social and economic problems. What is the record of these programs? Let us look at them.\r\nAllow me to guide you to look them over one by one.\r\nWhen we speak of peace and security, we are reminded of the recent capture by the government of the almost legendary leader of the New People\u2019s Army, the return of 26,500 former Mindanao secessionists, the capture and surrender of 6,500 former members of the leftist group and the Leftist-Rightist conspiracy, the complete elimination of the capability of any group\u2014political, economic, or social\u2014to establish a private army or a nationwide criminal syndicate, the dramatic reduction of crime in Metro Manila, and the reduction of the crime density of 139 per 100,000 population in 1972 down to the level of 51.5 per 100,000 population. All these make us conclude that the grave dangers that have confronted the country four years ago have considerably lessened.\r\nBut as I have said repeatedly, military experience in the past and present demonstrates one outstanding fact of contemporary life\u2014the security nations and states will hinge principally upon the success or failure of subversion, massive infiltration with overt alien support, or indigenous rebellion.\r\nSurvival and security will, therefore, I repeal, hinge on the manner in which we successfully counteract this destabilizing factor which may come from outside our country.\r\nI repeat what I have written before I contended then, as I contend now, that both the insurgents and the secessionist movement were in many respects violent consequences of the rebellion of the poor. As they constitute a socioeconomic problem, the strategy likewise has to be principally socioeconomic. This was true of the Leftist-Rightist rebellion, and this is true the secessionist movement in the south.\r\nToday, the strategy must remain the same. It remains political, as I have already said, in the sense that it follows the politics of integration rather than of conflict. We have attempted to show, as I have already said, that grievances whether economic, social, or political can be redressed by a society with one purpose, and that is to give social dimension to its progress and advancement.\r\nWe have integrated all the police forces of the country, the Integrated National Police Force. And from a national perspective, our national civilian police system has the capability to react with considerable efficiency and sophistication to any reasonable volume of crimes. But, and this we take note of, the reduction of crime is in the final analysis a social question, addressed to the entire society rather than simply to the police enforcers.\r\nThis is the burden than exacts a heavy charge on the economic capability of the nation. And it is useful that in our economy the country has made significant gains.\r\nOur dramatic recovery from shortage to self-sufficiency was recorded in our rice production program\u2014Masagana 99. This was the decisive step for the food production effort because rice has always been the crisis sector in our agricultural area. Nor has this thrust been limited alone to the rice and corn production program. At the close of 1975, the total credit channeled to agriculture had reached P7.7 billion. This was a decisive transfer of resources to the agricultural sector that had never thought of or undertaken in all the years of existence of our country and our Republic.\r\nAll these proved some merit in our bias for a balanced agroindustrial economy.\r\nIn the industrial sector, we instituted a new industrial plan that stressed the rectification of imbalances generated by early policies and the restructuring of industry in a manner conducive to sound and accelerated growth. In the new plan, industrial development was stimulated by the following policies:\r\nThis period saw the establishment and efficient management of the Board of Investments and the creation of the Department of Industry that guided the way towards industrial progress throughout the land.\r\nBecause of the recasting of our incentives program for oil drilling through the Exploration Act of December, 1972, adopting the system of oil sharing on the basis of a service contract under which the oil driller commits himself to drill so many number of holes within a certain period in a given area, oil has been discovered in at least two places in the Philippines. One in Palawan with the Calamian group of islands on March 11, 1976, and the other at the Reed Bank west of Palawan on July 30, 1976. I need not state that the discoveries and possibly the exploitation of these oil deposits may completely alter the economic planning for the development of the entire country.\r\nThe energy program, however, goes beyond the search for oil, into the development of new energy sources, as well as alternative and indigenous resources, such as coal, natural gas and gas liquids, geothermal resources, nuclear fuel reserves, hydro, solar, and other nonconventional sources. As I have said, uranium has been reportedly found in the Bicol area, Samar, Ilocos, and Mindanao. With 74% of our fuel requirements coming from petroleum, 5% from hydroelectric power, and only a small percentage from other fuels, and 86% of such petroleum requirements coming from the Middle East, it is in our national interest to find dependable safeguards against the vagaries of international oil politics, not to speak of cartel taxes, infiniteness of resources, and the conservation programs of exporting countries.\r\nIn the last three-and-a-half years, foreign equity investments approved by the Board of Investments have doubled, if not trebled. Even more impressive has been the growth of gross domestic capital formation.\r\nIn 1973, gross domestic formation totaled P7.8 million representing 20.1% of gross national product and a 14.4% increase over the previous year\u2019s figure. In 1974, this rose further to P9,447,000, represent\u00ading 23.1% of GNP and a 21.1% increase over the 1973 level. At the close of 1975, domestic investment rose even more dramatically to P12,197,000, a phenomenal rise by 29.1% and representing 28.2% of GNP.\r\nMonetary and banking reforms, calculated to play a vital role in domestic capital formation, proved a vigorous instrument for growth. The policy encouraging mergers and consolidation of medium-sized banks not only increased their capitalization, but also defamiliarized many of these Finns, thereby broadening the base of their ownership\u2014in themselves, independent areas of reforms. The redirection of credit to priority areas in agriculture, agrarian reform, exports and small-scale industries created for monetary policy a progressive new role in social and economic reform.\r\nToday, a significant part of growth is steadily being channeled towards further economic activities. Domestic and foreign investors continue to have a strong confidence in the growth prospects of the national economy.\r\nNow let me go to social equity.\r\nIn the fulfillment of our development vision, we make it a precondition that the security and well-being of our people must come first.\r\nThis was the first and overriding task of our national development plan; and in a very real sense, all our programs were parts of this effort to provide for social equity.\r\nThere is not any program of government that is not directed towards granting growing social dimension to the efforts of both the public and the private sectors.\r\nSince 1972, we have instituted various measures, some of them radical, intended to democratize the benefits of development among our people and to provide the social and economic infrastructure that would improve our people\u2019s capacity to contribute to production, and to meaningfully share in the fruits of production.\r\nThe measures taken include not merely those which directly affect the distribution of income and wealth. They also include those which expand the opportunities of the lower classes of our people for employment, advancement, recreation, and education.\r\nIn fulfilling this social vision, we ruled out the expropriation of wealth and its redistribution among our people in the form of welfare wages. We sought more lasting change and improvement of human welfare, centered on the person\u2019s productive capacities and initiative.\r\nFor this purpose, we placed the greatest emphasis on social transformation of the steady growth of opportunities for individual fulfillment.\r\nThe cornerstone of this policy is agrarian reform, which we have expressly addressed to our rural poor who had labored for centuries under a feudalistic land system. Immediately after the martial law proclamation, we declared the entire country a land reform area. Less than a month later, on 21 October 1972, we declared the full emancipation of the tenant from bondage to the land he tilled.\r\nThis was only as it should be. For quite apart from historical reasons a full 27 million\u2014or nearly 65% of our population\u2014are dependent on agriculture.\r\nOur land reform program specifically encompassed rice and corn lands, which historically had been the stronghold of share tenancy, and upon which some 13.5 million depend. Involved in the program were 496,357 tenants.\r\nIn four years, we have transferred all lands covered by the decree to this new system of tenure. Lands expropriated were distributed to the tenants, and as of today, 294,885 titles covering an area of 340,347 hectares have already been transferred to 188,642 tenant recipients. Parallel to this, on lands of 7 hectares or less allowed the landlord, we have fully implemented their conversion to the leasehold system of tenure.\r\nThe other component of agrarian reform covers land consolidation and settlements. Eight priority areas have been proclaimed as new settlements. As of today, 40 agricultural settlements of 701,251 hectares and involving 47,772 families have been established. New settlements have been set up in 118,045 hectares with 3,575 settlers.\r\nIn the case of plantation crop areas, which have been exempted from land reform because of the advantage of large-scale cultivation, we have sought equity for agricultural labor in terms of profit sharing, higher wages, and better working conditions.\r\nSupporting agrarian reform is the cooperatives development program which seeks specifically to ensure the productive fanning of the land by the newly liberated tenants. In declaring a fresh effort towards cooperatives, we have sought to correct the failure of previous programs and to institute a system of implementation based on stages of rural workers\u2019 organization, which progressively intensified farmer participation in cooperation endeavors,\r\nIn 1960, 6.3% of our total labor force was unemployed. In 1968, it rose to an all time high of 7.9%. By February 1975, this has been brought down to 3.6%.\r\nThe key to the reversal of the level of unemployment in our country was the expansion of economic activities in all sectors of the economy but it was expansion that was directed with definitive bias on the side of labor. Our basic development strategy stressed the increasing absorption of labor in gainful economic activities. Development must create more jobs and increase the security of a livelihood for every employable member of society. In our case, we must generate some 400,000 jobs a year, if we are to keep the pace of our development.\r\nAlong with these basic reforms towards social transformation, we have expanded the level of social services in education, health and nutrition, family planning, housing, and environmental planning. All of our programs are in line with the entire development effort.\r\nIn education, we have begun the fundamental realignment of our educational system towards the manpower requirements of development, the upgrading of the quality of education, and the full democratization of educational opportunity.\r\nNo child today is deprived of the opportunity to learn. The yearly expansion of our school enrollment is matched by increases in our school facilities and in our teaching force. And the provision for a free subsidized education has periodically been stretched upward to higher levels of schooling.\r\nTo answer the manpower needs of development, and the employment opportunities of our manpower, we have invested heavily in vocational and technical schools, in schools for adult education, in barrio high schools, and in manpower training centers. We have scholarships both for the cultural minorities and for the majority. We have grantees, state scholars, science scholars, and special scholars numbering by the thousands. As a part of the grantees or scholars from the cultural minorities, there are more than 7,000 government-subsidized scholars as of today. We have programmed the establishment of a science high school in each of the country\u2019s 13 regions to increase the output of graduates, which number 6,000 a year as of now.\r\nAnd in higher education, emphasis has been given on the screening of applicants for college studies and the improvement of the quality of educational deliveries. State facilities have been vastly expanded, and attention has been given to the development of more agricultural universities.\r\nHealth, nutrition, family planning, and environment programs have been integrated into our programs of social services.\r\nOur program to arrest the high birthrate squarely relates to the level of welfare within the access of every citizen and the increments of growth generated by the expansion of economic activities. From the 3.1% population growth rate registered at the start of 1973, our programs for population planning have been able to bring it down to 2.6%.\r\nIn this particular matter a member of the Batasang Bayan and, incidentally, the Governor of Metro Manila, is to be thanked for the family planning program.\r\nMost all observers realize and understand that while we are apparently concentrating on the increase in production as well as in the growth of the gross national product, a corresponding obsession should arise among our population with respect to family planning and the control of the growth of our population.\r\nIn this campaign against malnutrition, we have designed and implemented what no less than the UN University has called \u201cthe most comprehensive program of applied nutrition at the village level yet undertaken by any country.\u201d This report notes that the program has \u201ccontributed in three years to an improvement of nutrition and health in the Philippines.\u201d\r\nI need not go into the increase in per capita calorie consumption. Suffice it to say the education program of the Nutrition Center of the Philippines did well to solve all nutrition problems even without the necessity of increasing special food production.\r\nFinally, we have implemented a comprehensive program for the housing of our population. As a first step, we have consolidated the diverse efforts of many agencies engaged in housing programs under a National Housing Authority. Secondly, we have increased apace our squatters resettlement efforts in order to decongest the urban areas, especially Metropolitan Manila which seems to have a monopoly of the squatters of this country. And thirdly, we have redirected housing policy to the provision of home for low-income groups.\r\nOne of the results of the last science convention on the subject of the survival of humankind: The Philippine experiment was the indication that we may have cheaper material for low-cost housing in the Philippines. And this cheap material may be the sulphur that we see in our volcano\u2014the silver lining in the clouds.\r\nThe World Bank report indicates that the lowest cost of a house is probably P28,000. But if we could use sulphur, probably we could bring down the cost of every dwelling to P5,000 or P10,000.\r\nFinally, we have restructured the basic thrust of our social welfare programs towards curative and restorative projects. These projects have been designed to alleviate the broad base of mass poverty, but they embody schemes for the productive utilization of the energies of the needy even of the handicapped. It is not a scheme of merely granting doles and creating mendicants, but a scheme rather of infusing character into all the members of our nation.\r\nAll these programs of social reforms and social services converge on the total vision of social and economic equality. We have by no means banished poverty from our midst, but we can certainly say that our people have not been denied equity in growth and participation in productive labor, and equal opportunity in education.\r\nNow, let us go to foreign relations.\r\nThe exacting tasks of domestic problems have not turned inward the outlook of this nation. Side by side with our domestic programs for social, economic, and political development, and integral to them, we have moved decisively to develop our relations with the rest of the world.\r\nThroughout the world, change has been the theme of the decade.\r\nThe international economic environment has been visited by crises of a kind and scale unprecedented in history. From the initial shock of the energy crisis, the world has braced itself against the onslaught of global recession, of commodity shortages including food, of international monetary disorder, and of sustained challenge to the world economic order.\r\nOn another front, the system of alliances on which the fragile peace and security of the world was based was disintegrating, and in its place new arrangements based on different perceptions of global realities were emerging.\r\nBut long before the challenge was upon us, we correctly read the inexorable course of global affairs. Before events could make the decisions for us, we undertook the necessary effort of seizing control over our foreign policy and of revising the very framework of our relations with the rest of the world, it was action necessitated and engendered by the thrust of domestic policies toward independence, innovation, and total self-reliance.\r\nIdentifying geopolitical realities and national priorities, we shaped the cornerstones of a new foreign policy. The first and most fundamental of these stressed the supremacy of national interests in the conduct of foreign affairs.\r\nSecondly, we stressed the need for flexibility and pragmatism in our diplomacy, to encompass not merely our hopes for peace and security, but our wry aspirations to development. And thirdly, we stressed the need for contacts with all nations desiring our friendship on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.\r\nIn our relations with the Western countries, particularly the United States with whom our ties are deep and strong, we have sought and found a new relationship compatible with emerging realities in Asia and in our respective circumstances. We have just entered, a crucial stage in the renegotiation of our Mutual Defense Agreement, our bases treaty, our military assistance agree\u00adment, and our economic ties.\r\nWith Southeast Asia, with whom we seek the deepest and closest ties, we have developed and contributed to the building of a strong regional association in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The historic agreements in Bali this year are the culmination of almost a decade of nurturing Southeast Asia\u2019s essential homogeneity, and the commencement of a regional effort that is of far-reaching value to the security and development prospects of all Asian peoples and countries.\r\nWith the Socialist world, we have forged vigorous and harmonious relations with the great majority of Socialist countries, including the People\u2019s Republic of Soviet Socialist Republics which I visited this year, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam whose delegation headed by Vice Minister of Foreign Relations Pham Hien visited with us the other month after which visit normal diplomatic relations between our countries were established. Differences of ideology have in no way constricted the possibilities of com\u00admerce and cultural exchange, and we are finding with every passing year that these countries provide new markets and sources of supply of enormous signif\u00adicance to our development effort.\r\nWith Japan, the European Economic Community, and the industrialized West, we have continued to nurture a strong and close relationship, particularly in trade and investments. From these countries have flowed substantial capital investments in the national economy that make them truly effective partners in our bid for national development.\r\nFinally, we have closely identified ourselves with the cause of the Third World countries in seeking a new international economic order and in improving upon the system of cooperation among countries of similar circumstances and aspirations. With these countries we have found a coalition of interests and aspirations that is perhaps the most important phenomenon in international affairs today. We have sought to forge the same ties with the Islamic countries, with countries in the Middle East, in Africa, and in Latin America.\r\nFor beyond the memories of shared social experiences and of shared des\u00adtitution and misery, we have in association found the levers for creating changes in our conditions and in terms of international economic life.\r\nBarely a year ago we hosted the historic Ministerial Conference of the Group of 77, which prepared the position of the Third World for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Last May, it was our great privilege to present to that conference the Declaration and Programme of Action in the UNCTAD meeting in Nairobi.\r\nThe sum of these initiatives in foreign policy is a diplomacy placed at the service of national development, and imbued with a vision of the interdepend\u00adence of nations. In four years we have constructed methodically a network of relations with many countries that confers benefits upon the national life and that in no way has endangered our sense of well-being and security.\r\nAnd more than this, we have won for ourselves and our nation the respect and the goodwill of the great majority of the human family. And that is not a mean achievement at a time when many speak of competition among the na\u00adtions for the resources of this planet.\r\nWe have made groundbreaking progress in all these spheres of national life because we have a government that truly governs. Behind every stride we have taken in securing the peace, in spurring the economy towards growth, in spreading the benefits of growth among our people, and in promoting our commerce and contact with the rest of the world is the recovery and the strengthening of political will in this country.\r\nFor the conditions that invoked the martial necessity derived from a long period of decay in our political system and political institutions. All the sound and glossy qualities of democratic process that marked our political life for generations were merely the crust of an unequal political order which proved finally unable to respond to national realities and problems. As vested interests manipulated the apparatus of power and the disaffected majority agitated for some measure of political control, our government steadily drifted towards paralysis and in many cases abdication. We have sought to reorganize government as I have stated at the beginning of this speech.\r\nPerhaps the most important aspect of reorganization was the creation of the National Economic Development Authority, which gathered under one roof the planning of national development. From this office have originated the plans and programs of our New Society.\r\nThe merit of this new administrative structure has been fully shown, in the operations of our various programs. Admittedly, there is need for more managerial skills which take time to generate. But the new orientation is there; the capacity to act is there; and the sense of a single organization at work marks the government we have in our country today.\r\nThe harmonious flow of policies to programs, of responsibilities from the Presidency of the smallest government unit, underlies at root, the progress we have made in our national development program.\r\nAllied with the responsibility of government to plan and manage national development is the task to generate and harness resources effectively. And thus we have raised the revenues of government from P1.0 billion in 1965 when I look over the Presidency to P16.5 billion in the just concluded fiscal year.\r\nWithout the efforts to increase the fiscal base of the economy, the accomplishments of government in the field of public investments would have been severely curtailed. The limits of our efforts must necessarily be circumscribed by the extent to which we improve the base of government in\u00adcome.\r\nDuring the last four years, public investments have been poured heavily into public services especially into the infrastructure development program which are designed to expand the productive capacity of the economy. Public investment expenditures have risen to about 38% of the total expenditures of the national government. In the earlier years of my administration, the most that we could reach was close to 20%. In a period of four to five years, we have doubted public investment in infrastructure development.\r\nIn 1976 alone, total national government spending has amounted to P23.2 billion. Of this, public infrastructure programs have received an allocation in excess of P8 billion. Included here are not only the all-important farm to market roads, which became a total link between farmer and consumer, but irrigation, electrification, and water resources projects. By the end of 1977, we expect to have established one electric cooperative in each province. By 1984, we should be able to energize all the barrios; and total electrification should come by 1990. As of now, our electrification program has registered 65 electric cooperatives, serving 386,363 homes in 361 municipalities. In waterworks, 68 projects have so far been identified; 30 of which are programmed for implementation within the next two years. The plan is for investments in these areas to grow over time as the development program accelerates.\r\nBut where have we spent all this money? Significantly, there has also been a clear shift in the regional pattern of public investments. In the fifties and sixties, public investments were concentrated in Region IV, comprising Southern Luzon including Metro Manila, which received on the average almost half of total public investments. From FY 1971 to 1975, the region\u2019s share in public capital expenditure has declined to only about 28% of the total, without any decrease in the actual amount involved. In per capita terms, it ranked only fourth, trailing Regions III (Central Luzon), VIII (Eastern Visayas), and II (Cagayan Valley).\r\nThis is seen in the simultaneous development of regional integrated projects, such as the ones in the Bicol river basin area, Mindoro, Cagayan Valley, Panay Island, Samar and Leyte, Zamboanga, and other parts of\u00a0Mindanao.\r\nThe decline of the importance of Region IV derives from the decline of per capita public investments in the Metro Manila area\u2014notwithstanding the fact that here, in this prime city of the Philippines, we see the most palpable examples and manifestations of government expenditures. In FY 1972, per capita expenditure in the Metropolis was P33.60. In FY 1975, this went down to P23.41. On the other hand, for the rest of the Philippines the public investments rose from P20.21 in FY 1972, to P90.00 in FY 1975. This is by way of a rejoinder to those who think that all the public money having been spent only in Metro Manila.\r\nThe pattern of revenue utilization exemplifies the basic spirit of our national development program\u2014the emphasis on the demoralization of wealth, the regionalization of growth, and the linkage of all sectors of the national eco\u00adnomy. We seek in the plan the regeneration not of just one part, but of the whole society and the whole economy. And no region, no community, no individual has been left out from the compass of the entire development effort.\r\nThis shift of expenditures to the rural areas has brought about a strong government presence in places where there hardly was any perception of it before. The establishment of the regional offices of all the departments of government proved to be farsighted.\r\nWhat are the future perspectives? Let me quote the recent World Bank country report. And I quote: \u201cThere is little question,\u201d says a recent World Bank country report, \u201cthat the Philippines has the physical and human resources required for the sustained economic improvement during the next few decades and its more equitable distribution. Moreover, recent economic and social reforms have contributed to a policy environment more conducive to sustained economic growth.\u201d\r\nBut what we have achieved is simply part of the initial stages of our total national development. We must plan ahead and so what are these plans in the years ahead?\r\nBy 1980, we should expect the basic infrastructure of growth to be completed, linking the farmer, the small industries, and the consumers to the total domestic economy. By the year 2000, we should have attained our objective of integrating our socially fragmented nation, through our socioeconomic and political programs, the development or adoption of institutions and appropriate technologies to ensure standards of harmony and well-being within the national community.\r\nAt the end of the millennium, our population shall have increased to 83.4 million people. Although, as the Family Planning program puts it, we are trying to bring this down to 55 million. This will need an annual GNP growth rate of 7% in real terms to support reasonable living standards. Energy con\u00adsumption alone will rise to five times the level of our consumption in 1975. As fossil fuels from outside sources are depleted, we will need to develop our own resources. We will need an added hydroelectric capacity of at least 5,400 megawatts, nine times our present capacity of 600 MW, or three plants of 300 MW each being put on stream every four years. Of geothermal resources, we will need some 80 plants of 55 MW each to meet our target of 400 MW by year 2000. We have just started to put 255 MW generators in Tiwi and 2 in Bae, Laguna. We will need 14 million metric tons of coal, which means 20 mines regularly producing 2,000 tons per day. Uranium exploration should intensify to support the nuclear power subsystem, where we will need three to four additional units of 1,000 MW each to meet our requirements. Oil drilling must produce at least 250 wells over the next 10 years. This energy development program is expected to cost $24 billion over the next 25 years.\r\nIn agriculture, we must realize at least a 4% growth in food production during the next decade, by expanding arable and harvested areas, and increasing yields. To attain increased productivity we well have to adopt or develop new and appropriate technologies; organize and manage more efficiently our extension services; commit large-scale investments to water re\u00adsources, fertilizer, communication, and transport; and rationalize pricing.\r\nWe must also utilize an increasing part of our resources to farm the seas for the \u201cblue revolution\u201d of the immediate future. There are those who have misgivings about increasing our food production because of the inadequacy of our land area. This year, we are starting the farming of the sea. With relatively productive marine resources in an area of 1,655,300 square kilometers, we should be able to bring about such a revolution, just as in the last 10 years we were able to bring about through our high-yielding varieties, the green revolution.\r\nIn industry, we must support our objective of higher industrial growth with investments in relatively labor-intensive finished consumer goods industries, the second stage of import substitution for selected intermediate and capital goods industries, and the generation of exports. We must create sufficient jobs to absorb the present ranks of the unemployed, and the 400,000 annual addition to the labor force. Public investments must increase to about 5% of the GNP by 1980, particularly in the area of housing. There must continue to be reform in taxation to reduce the heavy dependence on international trade and correspondingly widen the domestic base as well as improve the social equity of the entire tax system.\r\nIn government, reorganization must continue as a constant mechanism for invigorating the bureaucracy. The planning capacity of government, beginning at the center and including its various departments and agencies, should improve, training of middle managers should continue to be upgraded, systems of rewards and punishment and of enlarging accountability instituted. Public corporations should encourage greater public participation, and local participation in the decision-making process should continue to broaden.\r\nTo keep pace with the changing rural to urban profile of our communities, we must exert every effort to liberate these communities from blight, congestion, and hazards; bring about the optimum use of land as a welfare rather than as a commodity for trade; preserve a desirable balance between the natural beauty of our land and waters on the one land and the claims of technology on the other; and bring about the best possible interrelationship among the various communities and the regions.\r\nBy 1980, it is predicted that Manila may have expanded so much that it may include Infanta, Quezon, province. This will be a city, therefore; two sides of which are harbors. One on the Pacific Ocean and one on Manila Bay or the China Sea side.\r\nBy the year 2000, Manila Bay should not be polluted. By the year 1980, we should be halfway with the reclamation of 100,000 hectares in the northern part of Manila Bay, part of which should be utilized for high-quality marine products in sea farming, in the fishponds that shall be allocated thereat. Bataan may have developed into an industrial area; Cavite and Batangas into tourist recreation resorts. A canal may have been dug at Atimonan, a 7-kilometer canal across the isthmus from the Pacific Ocean to Tayabas Bay, thus shortening the way for ocean-going ships traveling from the Pacific to Manila Bay.\r\nEducation must continue as a high priority, not only within the schools, but outside the school system. This calls for a more judicious use of public media and other facilities in the task of adult, or out-of-school education. Through vigorous educational campaigns, we should succeed in orienting our popula\u00adtion to our increasing social development goals. By 1985, we should succeed in reducing the population growth rate to about 2.4%, if not less, and in eliminating wasteful and dangerous consumption habits particularly in food, energy, space, water, and air.\r\nWe should in all aspects of our national life seek to promote more vigorously the ethic of self-reliance, from security to technology, from agri\u00adcultural to industrial production.\r\nAs I see it, this decade and the next will set the stage for expanding our country\u2019s productive infrastructure. We shall witness new gains in agriculture, the development of higher standards in our manpower, the institutionalization of development management in our public and private sectors, a common thrust towards full agro-industrial modernization. We shall see new levels of income, rationalization of our technological problems and capabilities, new standards of living, and a different quality of life, particularly among those who live a marginal social existence as of now.\r\nWe have the natural resources, we have the manpower. We have the programs and above all, we have the political will.\r\nLet us without equivocation unite behind these programs. They deserve the support of all. For whatever we achieve tomorrow can only mean progress if it transforms the life of the poor. Our task is to see within the shortest possible time the final emancipation of the poor of our country.", "title": "We Stand Proud as a Nation Today"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Quirino Grandstand, Manila, on September 19, 1975]\r\nItinakda natin ang araw na ito para sa pagdiriwang, sa halip na Linggo, hindi dahil ibig nating mapaaga ang ikatlong anibersaryo ng proklamasyon ng Bagong Lipunan sa ating bayan, kundi dahil ibig nating maiharap sa ating sambayanan ang mahahalagang suliraning hindi na dapat pang ipaghintay sa ika-21 ng buwang ito.\r\nAnibersaryo man o hindi ang araw na ito, oras na upang lingunin ng sambayanang Pilipino ang mga nakaraang taon, upang suriin at pakialaman ang tunay na katayuan ng ating bansa.\r\nMakaraan pa ang dalawang araw, papasok na tayo sa ika-apat na taon ng Bagong Lipunan. Sa susunod na mga araw at buwan, matatayo tayong muli sa isang lalong maselan na pagsubok, at kakailanganin nating lahat ang sukdulang tibay at tatag ng loob, alang-alang sa ating Bagong Lipunan.\r\nNgunit bago tayo magtangka na akaying muli ang ating sambayanan sa mga susunod na yugto sa ating pakikihamok sa kapalaran, kailangang sagutin ang ilang katanungan.\r\nKung hindi natin masasagot ang mga katanungang ito nang buong katapatan, hindi tayo dapat mangahas na magpatuloy.\r\nWith or without the anniversary that we mark today, the time has come once more for the Filipino people to look across the years and assess the state of the nation.\r\nTwo days from today, we enter the fourth year of the New Society, our program of national transformation. This is bound to be a decisive phase of that program, one that will require the utmost resiliency and fortitude of both our government and our people.\r\nBut before we can even begin to think of leading our people into a new period of that struggle, we must answer some questions.\r\nUnless we can confidently answer these questions, we dare not proceed.\r\nIn less than four months, we shall pass into the second half of this turbulent decade, and already we know that this will be an even more critical period for the world at large.\r\nThis, too, will be crucial for us.\r\nFor, as with the other nations of the world, none of our problems are completely behind us. They have been transmuted, but not definitively solved, and they will continue to be with us, in various forms and degrees.\r\nIn three years, we have demonstrated a capacity for recovery and growth, but as in other countries the gains\u2014however dramatic\u2014have not brought us complete fulfillment.\r\nWe are no longer the paralyzed nation, of course, which we were at the start of our program in September 1972, but still, if we ask ourselves frankly, have we become the nation we wanted to be, after breaking with our past?\r\nWe know that our goals must extend beyond mere recovery, but we also know that crisis awaits each step we take.\r\nThe nature of the problems we face\u2014whether they originate from within our society or from conditions abroad continues to challenge fundamental assumptions in politics, in the economy, and in society itself.\r\nThe world has not known so searching a challenge since the crisis years of the Depression and the Second World War. And no nations are so severely challenged as the nations of the Third World, which like us must take up the burden of modernization under conditions of tension and flux throughout the world.\r\nIn our own country, the accumulated experience of the past three years promises more challenges rather than relief. For once we set our program of reform in motion, there is no alternative but to prosecute it to its legitimate end. It would be dangerous for us to ride the crest of illusion or false hopes.\r\nWe are wont to hear that we, the Philippines, are a nation that has made a dramatic comeback from disaster, and begun a strong surge towards growth. Even the most critical foreign experts say so.\r\nThe national economy, for many years a deficit spender of resources, exhibits both vigor and resiliency in the face of crisis. Economic activity of all kinds is never more pronounced than at any other time in our history. International investors, and no less than the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, continue to manifest their faith in our economy.\r\nThere is order where there used to be none; anarchy is only a memory of the past; and growth and changes seem to be everywhere around us.\r\nAnd when we look at the individual citizen, there is reason to feel that his rights and liberties are on the whole much better secured today than they were before the intervention of constitutional authoritarianism.\r\nLet us look at the farmers: the emancipation of the Filipino farmer from economic and political bondage. This has been the all-consuming obsession of government since that fateful day of September 21, 1972, when it began the arduous task of bringing about lasting reforms in the society.\r\nComprising 70% of the population and more than half of the labor force, Filipino farmers have been, and will continue to be, the main beneficiaries of the major government programs launched over the first 1,000 days of the New Society.\r\nFor centuries, whether under the Spaniards or Americans, or the politicians and feudal tyrants of the old order, the Filipino farmer was a virtual slave, bereft of self-respect and dignity.\r\nHe was bound to the soil, tilling land that belonged to another man, taxed of both goods and money, deprived of an education, refused access to credit and exploited by unscrupulous moneylenders, manipulated by politicians and landlords, isolated from modern technology.\r\nToday, however, the farmer has rediscovered himself and has attained for himself a new identity.\r\nWhere before he was an abject tenant, today he is a proud landowner.\r\nWhere before he had to beg his landlord or a usurer for a loan in order to plant and send his children to school or feed his family, today he has a far-flung system of rural credit eagerly providing his financing needs at low interest rates.\r\nWhere before prices for his produce used to plunge down at harvest time because of the unbridled forces of supply and demand under an unbridled free-enterprise system, today he has a well-funded program of price support that guarantees profitable farm gate prices for his major agricultural crops.\r\nWhere before he was left alone to contend with the high cost of production inputs, today he is insulated from the impact of escalating world prices through government subsidies of key production inputs, such as fertilizer and animal feeds.\r\nWhere before he used to rely solely on antiquated farming methods, today he can count on an army of over 6,000 farm management technicians and rural broadcasters who use every technique known to media for instruction and guidance on modem agricultural technology.\r\nWhere before he used to contend with market forces which sapped the profits from his produce, he can now depend on a nationwide network of \u201csamahang nayon\u201d that gives him greater bargaining power, and assures him of a fair price for his products.\r\nToday, we find unprecedented prosperity in the rural areas, an obvious upsurge in the purchasing power of the Filipino farmer, and a general air of confidence and optimism in the countryside. Paradoxically, martial law, the instrument of the colonizer to preserve the status quo, has brought true freedom to the countryside for the first time in centuries.\r\nIn the first 1,000 days of the New Society, therefore, we have succeeded\u2014through deliberate policy and action\u2014in helping the Filipino farmer rediscover himself, attain a new dignity, and secure true freedom.\r\nWith respect to labor, the pace of employment opportunities has risen, generally speaking, in keeping with the growth in gross national product. Compared to the employment levels before martial law, new jobs have been created at an average of 5% annually.\r\nIn spite of a worldwide recession, we succeeded in cutting down unemployment to only 4.1% this year, the lowest in our postwar history. In other words, out of a labor force of 14 million, only 570,000 workers are now openly unemployed. This is significant since in the United States, 4% unemployment is considered normal.\r\nAt the same time, we have sought to safeguard the security\u2014both internal and external\u2014of our country. Internally, we had the leaders of the Leftist and Rightist rebellion that threatened the stability of our Republic, as well as the secessionist movement and the Moro National Liberation Front. Now, the open-handed and generous policy towards the rebels in Mindanao is beginning to bear fruit. And we see in the immediate future the termination of all hostilities\u2014in Mindanao, in Central Luzon\u2014all over the Philippines.\r\nBut the world continues to be faced with problems of security. After the Vietnam War, the Philippines has had to reassess its security arrangements with the United States. We are in the middle of negotiations, but we have adopted the policy of self-reliance. I have had to visit the People\u2019s Republic of China to show to the whole world that our windows are open to those who would be friends with us and in so doing, we seek to secure our country from any untoward aggression from outside.\r\nAs we strive to bring the government closer to the people, we must take the parallel step of bringing the people closer to the government. The moratorium on elections in our political life\u2014however infrequent a replacement so that the people may intervene successfully in national decision making. The people must never be made to accept that the government, no matter how wise and dedicated, is master of their destiny; rather, they must be continuously reinforced in their faith that they are the master of government.\r\nAt the start of our program of reform, we saw that if our political life was not to arrive at an impasse between an anarchic order and a despotic one, we had to create new mechanisms for the individual to make his voice heard on public issues.\r\nAnd that mechanism must be politics at community level, where citizens can shape their lives and together act to move the town, the city, the province, and the nation to action.\r\nThis is the fundamental rationale and the reason behind the creation of the barangay. This is what will make it a viable and dynamic institution.\r\nAt the same time we have harnessed into this mechanism for political action, the young of the barangay. You saw marching here the Kabataang Barangay, along with the capitanes de barangay who are also here, who now participate actively in everything that has to do with the community action. They provide the means by which our people can directly and truly participate in decision making.\r\nThe reform of our political system is in essence a call to discipline and order. This was the theme with which we began the building of our New Society, and this is the theme that we must continue. Today we know the dangers of relaxing disciplinary controls, before reform has fully seeped into our social life.\r\nThe dangers of decay which we see in government are magnified in various ways in the other sectors of society.\r\nOf course, we see it in the resurgence of petty crimes.\r\nBut it is the subtler assaults on public order and national discipline that must bear the greater weight of our concerns today. For these connote erosion in the program of reform, a softening of the will to change; and where these are seen conspicuously by the public, they contribute to the deterioration of morale and faith in social change.\r\nWith equal severity, people in private life must accept the burdens of the national transformation to which we have pledged ourselves. All must share with those in government and the masses the austerity demanded by the times.\r\nSadly, we note the dramatic gains of the past three years\u2014with their attendant effects on the life in Metropolitan Manila and the bastions of industry in other urban centers. They have ironically intensified natural appetites for finery and show, for lavish parties, flashy cars, mansions, big homes, expensive travel, and other counterproductive activities that dissipate the ethic of work, sacrifice, and discipline that is the meaning of the New Society. Because Manila is the hub of economic and international life in the country, it is not difficult to see the simplest amenities of life among the rich increasingly feeding the bitterness, the frustration, and exploitation of the very poor.\r\nThis implies a special obligation on the rich to find purpose and vision in the use of wealth; on those who hold positions of power and authority to be austere in their lifestyle and to discriminate in the exercise of anything that might be construed as special privilege. Here, there is an hierarchical distribution of responsibility: Those who hold more either of wealth or of authority must bear more responsibility.\r\nIt bears repeating that we do not seek to liberate our society from the old exploiters only to deliver it to new exploiters. We do not seek to make this society strong to secure the posterity of only a small class therein.\r\nCentral to our economic policies is the sharing of the increments of growth. We cannot speak of growth unless we can distribute such growth to the people, and we cannot speak of growth unless we first manage an entire spectrum of issues and problems that bedevil the economies of the industrialized as well as the nonindustrialized world.\r\nThe experience of the past three years provides statistical evidence that our economy has fared creditably well. Whoever takes the measure of the level of economic effort, whether for, or against, or neutral to the New Society or constitutional authoritarianism, cannot fail to admit that government intervention is the most significant factor in the acceleration of economic activity and growth by the injection of rationalization into such economic activity.\r\nJudged by any of the known indicators of economic growth, the conclusion points to a high level of performance of the national economy.\r\nGross national product averages 7%. In 1973, it was 6.3; in 1974, it shot up to 8-10%; in 1975, it registered a growth rate of 6%.\r\nThe figures for the year indicate the recovery phase of the economy from the recessionary pressures that persisted particularly during the first half of this fiscal year.\r\nAs of September this year, our international reserves stood at US$1.70 billion, compared to about $200 million to $300 million at the start of the New Society, manifesting the strength of the national economy in spite of the world\u00adwide economic crisis.\r\nBut the external sector, however, was characterized by a drastic decline in the country\u2019s balance of payments position from the FY 1974 surplus of $437 million to a deficit of $352 million at the end of FY 1975. Contributing mainly to decline was a shift from a merchandise trade surplus of $95 million to a deficit of $801 million in FY 1975.\r\nDespite the drastic decline in the prices of the country\u2019s major exports, receipts from merchandise trade grew by 11%. More significant increases were registered in nonmerchandise trade and transfer receipts of 26% and 12%, respectively. These movements, coupled with larger credit availments, halted the decline of the overall deficit position.\r\nExport shipments amounted to $2,544 million, as against an import bill of $3,345 million that has consisted mostly of crude oil and durable equipment imports.\r\nDespite the dampening of expectations in most sectors of the economy as a consequence of inflation and recession, investments remained on an uptrend in FY 1975.\r\nExpenditures for gross domestic capital formation in real terms recorded a growth of 22.3% in comparison to the 7.9% growth level in FY 1974. In millions of pesos, this is domestic capital formation amounting to P10.336 billion.\r\nPaid-in capital of newly registered corporations and partnerships expanded by about 30% to a level of P1,020 million at the end of the fiscal year, with the construction sector showing the biggest growth of 145%. Likewise, investments in BOI-registered firms grew by 34%, mainly as a result of the 192% increase in investments poured in by local businessmen.\r\nFrom 1972 to the middle of this year, July, the Securities and Exchange Commission registered a total of 13,300 new corporations with a total paid-up capital of P2,014 billion.\r\nBut even foreign investments have grown at dramatic rates during the three-year period of martial law in the New Society. From January 1973 to the end of FY 1975, foreign investment now total P2.25 billion. From the total amount of investment applications for the first semester of 1975, the Board of Investments has approved foreign investments totaling P50 million.\r\nNow, we come to the problem of inflation that confronts the whole world. Inflation, among all the economic indicators, has exerted the most pressure on the level of economic performance in this country and in all other countries of the world. But from the high 26% rise in consumer prices in FY 1974, the rate of inflation has come down possibly to 22%, although in July of this year, in one month alone, the inflation rate was supposedly only 4.2%.\r\nThe income of government has increased four times and our budget accord\u00adingly. Government receipts have expanded more rapidly than government ex\u00adpenditures, resulting in significant accumulations of budgetary surpluses. While other countries have suffered deficits since 1973, our country has always had a budgetary surplus, even as we increased government spending in essential services and economic activity. As of 1974, we had a budgetary surplus of P646 million.\r\nOverall, economic performances during the third year of the program of the New Society has been creditable. However, we must acknowledge serious problems overshadowing our economic life. We cannot escape the feeling here of being perpetually engaged in a race with problems and crises, regardless of our response at any given period.\r\nThe constriction of trade markets is a sobering experience for our export-oriented economy. This is neither the time nor the place to look into the trade policies of the big countries. Adjustments will be needed in the entire economic program, but these will in no way divert the fundamental direction of the prog\u00adram.\r\nWe greet the prognosis of an economic turnaround with hope, but without illusions. Should the industrialized economies successfully weather the recession, our export position will surely improve. But the lasting solution to the worldwide economic crisis remains to be found perhaps in a new pattern of economic relations among the nations, and this is the difficult agenda before the nations today.\r\nNow underneath these surface impressions of vitality and stability, there are profound problems that embattle our New Society. The general signs of national strength and progress somehow do not yet completely translate into realities sufficiently relevant to the ordinary individual. We must translate our growth into a state of high morale among people. Growth is rendered in statistics and changes in the landscape, changes in the cities, in the roads, in the infrastructures. But more than this, we need a new vigorous climate of confidence and hope, a passionate renewal of faith and devotion, which sustains armies and populations even in the midst of siege.\r\nAnd while our policies decree sweeping changes in our institutions and programs, we have lagged behind in the fundamental change on which the New Society is truly to be forged. This is the change within us, in our hearts, in our minds, in our souls\u2014the internal revolution, which our nation from the time of our forebears has passionately craved for.\r\nMany have already strayed away from the struggle, and forgotten the revolution we have mounted, choosing to reap benefits they did not sow, and grow so bold as to assume that others will do their work for them.\r\nMany have forgotten the demands that we placed on ourselves at the start of the program, preferring instead to seek the spoils of reform. And many still have added themselves to the problems, adding burdens to those that we assumed at the beginning of our reform.\r\nBehind the facade of national unity and behind this front of popular enthusiasm for reform, I raise my voice in alarm today, for we are in fact a nation divided against itself\u2014divided between urban and rural, rich and poor, majorities and minorities, privileged and underprivileged. Among some of the poor, there is still the nagging fear that they have, again, been left behind, and that we have liquidated an oligarchy only to set up a new oligarchy. The poor of our people accepted their new burdens without flinching, without crying out in pain, and without protest, but there is the feeling that all the sacrifice is not shared by all, that others are profiling from the situation at the expense of the people.\r\nWe face, therefore, a problem of morale among our people, a problem of faith in the program of social transformation.\r\nOur people speak less of institutions, policies, and programs, for these have not failed them. Our institutions are vigorous, our policies and programs are successful. But the people speak of men in high places, and in power, men of affluence, men in government, men of wealth and position, who have failed popular expectations, who still seem to be fighting for those very same principles and causes which we are fighting against, and who mock the very foundations of our reform movement.\r\nYes, the people speak of men of the law\u2014servants and enforcers of the law\u2014using their respective positions or ranks to inflict upon society the very abuses they have been appointed to fight. They also speak of men who seem particularly privileged to reinterpret the most profound message of government; and rearrange even the priorities of its social commitments and programs, according to their personal convenience and predilections.\r\nAgainst these enemies of the Republic, I now commit myself to do battle. And I ask our people to join me in this new war and this new revolution. Neither friendship nor enmity, fatigue nor pain, danger nor reward should stop us in the fulfillment of this mission.\r\nThe establishment of constitutional authoritarianism, which enabled this government to seize the reins of national directions, has resulted in the growth of bureaucracy as a massive machinery that affects every aspect of our national life. But along with this, there have also risen massive opportunities for graft, corruption, and the misuse of influence\u2014opportunities which are now being exploited within the government service.\r\nWhite the machinery of government has remodeled and redesigned its structure and operations to fit our development goals, the human factor of government has not kept pace with the reforms.\r\nThe massive cleanup of government offices that followed the proclamation of martial law has failed to keep the slate clean. Worse, there are new sores that are clearly emerging, inflicted by those who hold the wrong belief that the leadership is too preoccupied with other problems, that the people can be intimidated, or are too complacent, or that they can lake any liberties they please with our people, our Republic, and our reforms.\r\nClearly, we face here the danger that our New Society is giving birth to a new government elite, who resurrect in our midst the privileges we fought in the past, who employ the powers of high office for their personal enrichment, as well as of their business colleagues, relatives, and friends.\r\nI have, as you all know, ordered a performance audit of all local officials, as a way of compelling the accountability of many insensitive officials in the local level. This audit is not confined to local officials. The national officeholders are not exempt. This has been my painful duty as the head of the government and of the state.\r\n:\r\nFor the last three years I have been watching the conduct of officers and employees in the national as well as the local government. It is my duty as President of the Republic of the Philippines to reward what is proper, dedicated, and devoted service by a public servant, and by the same token, to punish for violation of the sacred trust of a public official.\r\nToday, therefore, I hereby announce the beginning of a sweeping, complete, and exhaustive reorganization of the government. This means the elimination of those who have violated the trust we had reposed in them and the reward of those who have performed their task with exemplary and outstanding distinction, courage, and dedication.\r\nAccordingly, as a first step to be followed later by a broader sweep in the lower ranks of the civil service and in other parts of the government including the military organization, a sweep which as of today includes a listing of 2,000 undesirables in the national government, I have decided to announce today the acceptance of the resignation of the following high-ranking officials in the government who have something to do with the procurement of government supplies and materials and the administration of valuable resources of the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nI hereby accept the retirement of Acting Chairman Ismael Mathay Sr., and his three sons have requested that they resign simultaneously with their father.\r\nThere are numerous, perhaps by the hundreds of auditing personnel whose names I have listed down in the original text of this speech but which I don\u2019t have the time to read before you, but they will be published in due time. They include inspectors of supplies and materials, auditors, regional auditors, super\u00advising auditors, and various officers and employees from the highest to the lowest ranks of the auditing service of the government.\r\nThe conclusion is ineluctable that in a great number of cases, graft and corruption in the government has been possible only with the collusion, participation, if not at the instance of personnel of the Commission on Audit\u2019s personnel. This is one of the offices in the government which have to be completely reorganized. I shall make the appointments in the immediate future.\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Misael Vera, who has from Europe sent me a cable to the effect that his doctors have advised him that he immediately retire from active government service. His replacement is under consideration.\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of the Commissioner of Customs, Rolando Geotina. There are 12 other high-ranking officers in the Bureau of Customs, whose names I need not read but which will be published in due time, whose resignations I have also accepted.\r\nThe resignation of Undersecretary Manuel Salientes of DND is hereby approved.\r\nCharges have been aired against certain officials and men in charge of the procurement of arms and munitions for the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\r\nI consider this, if true, the highest form of treachery to the Republic and to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In view of this, I have directed the Secretary of National Defense to conduct an exhaustive and overall investiga\u00adtion and to punish all parties to the limit.\r\nAt the Secretary\u2019s own request, in view of the conflict of interest which exists between that of his corporations which bear his name and that of the government, I hereby accept the resignation of Secretary of Public Works, Transportation, and Communications David Consunji. I shall announce his re\u00adplacement as soon as possible.\r\nAlso at his own request, I hereby also accept the resignation of Bureau of Public Works Director Desiderio Anolin. I shall announce his replacement immediately.\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of the whole Board of Transportation.\r\nThe Reorganization Commission\u2019s plan to reorganize and rename the Land Transportation Commission to form a part of the Bureau of Land Transporta\u00adtion is hereby approved and implemented.\r\nThe resignation of Land Transportation Commissioner Romeo Edu is there\u00adfore hereby approved.\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of Director PedroVillase\u00f1or and his replace\u00adment by Ceferino Carreon, who is Chairman of the Radio Control Board.\r\nSecretary of Public Highways Baltazar Aquino has submitted his resigna\u00adtion effective upon reaching the age of 65 in a few months. I hereby accept that resignation.\r\nThere are a number of names, including the highest-ranking officers of the DPH. Their resignations have also been accepted. Their names will be properly published.\r\nI have already announced the designation of Secretary Jacobo Clave as acting chairman of the civil service. Today I formally accept the resignation of all the commissioners of the civil service.\r\nThe Secretary of General Services, Constancio Castaneda himself, has suggested the acceptance of the recommendation of the Reorganization Commission reorganizing and renaming the Department of General Services Administration and its being placed directly under the Office of the President. I accept this recommendation and I approve it. Henceforth the positions of secretary, undersecretary, and other positions in that department and all its bureaus are hereby abolished as of today.\r\nIncluded in this is the acceptance of the resignation of the director of the Bureau of Buildings and Real Property Management, Celerino Sapitula, and his Assistant Director, Pastor Mesina. Also accepted are the resignations of the Director of the Bureau of Printing, Manuel L. Agustin, and his Assistant Director, Arsenio C. Maclan.\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of Director Refuerzo, to be replaced by Dr. Manuel Escudero Jr., currently Dean of Veterinary Medicine, University of the Philippines.\r\nI also accept the resignation of the following officials:\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources\r\nBureau of Forest Development\r\nI hereby accept at his own instance the resignation of Acting Director Jose Viado and of Officer in Charge Nestor Capellan of Region I.\r\nBoard of Examiners\r\nIn view of the adverse reports pertaining to the members of the Board of Examiners, it becomes necessary to declare as of today all positions in the Boards of Examiners vacant. I shall make the appointments in due time.\r\nDepartment of Trade\r\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\r\nI hereby accept the resignation of Arcadio E. Yabyabin, the head of the office, SEC.\r\nAlso accepted are the resignations of two other officers: Executive Officer Luis Lara and Senior Executive Assistant Gregorio Catapang.\r\nJudiciary\r\nBefore announcing the acceptance of resignations from members of this branch of government, I want to make an announcement pertaining to a reward to a deserving public servant. Today, I am honored and privileged to announce the elevation of the Solicitor General, Estelito Mendoza, to the rank of Cabinet member in view of his exemplary service to the Republic of the Philippines not only in the conduct of the legal defense of the Republic in our courts but also in legal conferences and forums outside the Philippines.\r\nThere are a number of judges whose resignations I have accepted.\r\nRetirement\r\nI have separated from this listing\u2014lest it be considered that they are included with the opprobrium and the charges that have been filed against those officials who have been voluntarily separated, some at their own instance\u2014a list of those who, because of long service in the government, have persistently and continuously requested that they are permitted to retire.\r\nFirst of all, before I announce these persons, I would like to say that they have continued to serve the government long after they reached the retirement age of 65. They have served with distinction the goals of reform and change of our New Society. The Republic of the Philippines, our people and I, myself, personally congratulate them for their unblemished record and I thank them warmly for their support of my leadership. But because of their insistence, I hereby accept their resignations.\r\nI refer, first of all, to the retirement of the chairman of these ceremonies today, the Secretary of Education and Culture, Juan Manuel, who, as he himself put it, is already 70 years old and entitled to a little rest.\r\nI also announce that under the same circumstances, a man who started out as Municipal Health Officer, many decades back and now attends to the health of our nation, seeks to retire and to allow younger men to take his place. He is no other than me Secretary of the Department of Health, Clemente Gatmaitan.\r\nThe third person to retire upon his insistence is not here for I sent him on a mission abroad, but before he left he agreed and we decided that I would be free to announce his retirement at any opportune time. I find this time opportune and I refer to the Commissioner of the Budget for many, many decades, Commissioner Faustino Sy-Changco.\r\nThis is just the beginning of the sweeping and continuous overhaul of the government machinery. For those against whom there are charges of dishonesty, corruption, and anomaly, let it be known that the acceptance of the resignations of such officers and employees does not exempt them from criminal prosecution, trial, and punishment if the evidence so warrants.\r\nWe are not limiting ourselves in this general cleanup to the ranks of the government. There are lawyers, accountants, doctors, and other professionals who, because of certain claims of blood kinship, affinity, personal closeness, friendship to, or business affiliation with supposedly high-ranking officials of the government, arrogantly utilize or wield influence not only in corrupting public officials or in coercing them but also in securing for themselves or their associates personal advantages denied to others, and in obtaining favors, privileges, and preferential treatment in derogation of fairness and justice.\r\nAll of them shall be purged from the ranks of those who would participate in the fruits of the New Society.\r\nAt the same time, I have ordered the Secretary of National Defense to arrest persons in the list of those against whom there is evidence of commission of crime. He shall be supported, of course, by the military organization.\r\nWhy have we done this at this time? This is a day of celebration. Why this attempt to clean up? Because I have warned, I have scolded, I have cajoled, I have reprimanded. We have given enough time to reform. But the contagion continues.\r\nNow it is time to cut off the infected parts of the society from active public life before they endanger the entire body politic.\r\nSo let this be a new warning to friend and foe alike.\r\nWe will be generous and forgiving with respect to momentary lapses, for we are all human, provided there is a sincere desire to reform and to rectify error.\r\nBut when there is pernicious and malicious persistence in doing wrong, then I will risk the displeasure of friends and the enmity even of relatives and avowed principled men to impose severe and just punishment.\r\nI have said that this new danger that confronts our Republic compels us now to do battle all over again with the same old courage, selflessness, and dedica\u00adtion that we can draw from our minds, our hearts, our souls.\r\nI have asked our people to pledge here and now not to allow the gains of the New Society to be lost because of the weaknesses, the viciousness, and the evil intentions of those on whom we have reposed the public trust. These men who have committed the highest form of treachery against our country and would turn traitors to our principles must be punished and, I swear to you, will be punished.\r\nBut the battle which we now join is a continuing and arduous one. We will be confronted by the grave danger of complacency and reaction, the old habits that refuse to die, the claims of ancient legacy, the exacting demands of daily and routinary living and survival in a world crushed by crisis and emergency. But so long as we are united, we shall overcome all of these.\r\nAnd today I come before you as the head of the political leadership of the Republic and pledge to you unswerving, unremitting, and uncompromising pursuit of our lofty goals. To this, we commit our very lives, our name, our possessions, and most valuable of all, our honor.", "title": "The President\u2019s Report to the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1981-07-27 18:03:22+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1981]\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker; distinguished members of this Assembly; the Batasang Pam\u00adbansa; Chief Justice and members of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals and other members of the judiciary; Your Excellencies, the Diplomatic Corps, and other foreign guests; my friends and countrymen:\r\nIn keeping with our constitutional duties and responsibilities, we convene here today, this fourth Monday of July, Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-One\u2014you to commence the Fourth Regular Session of this Assembly, and I to report on the state of the nation and on the proposed agenda of government.\r\nThe Constitution which vests, and I quote, \u201cthe legislative power in the Batasang Pambansa\u201d and mandates it to open its regular session on the fourth Monday of July, also reposes on the Pres\u00adident as \u201cHead of State and Chief Executive of the Republic of the Philippines\u201d the duty \u201cto ad\u00address the Batasang Pambansa at the opening of its regular session.\u201d\r\nEvery meeting between the executive authority and the legislative power in our government is a moment fraught with meaning and import for the affairs of state. But we meet today at a moment of historic significance and challenge for the work of government and for the cause of peace, unity, and progress for our nation.\r\nAll of us must have the wisdom to grasp the magnitude of this moment, and the resolve to face now and in the days to come the tasks of change in the machinery and the agenda of government.\r\nA major part of this decisive turn in national life has already been written by the historic act of terminating the period of martial law and crisis government in our country, and by the subsequent acts of the nation to amend the Constitution and elect directly a president pursuant to the new amendments.\r\nOn June 30 this year, when I was duly sworn in as the First President of the New Republic, I formally relinquished all powers and functions per\u00adtaining to the office of Prime Minister, which office we now ask the Batasan to fill.\r\nI hereby sign in your presence this executive order establishing the formal separation of the powers of the President and the Prime Minister, the areas of responsibilities as well as the guide\u00adlines for action, and the rules of coordination of the organizations under the Office of the President and that of the Prime Minister. In your pre\u00adsence, I sign this executive order. [\r\n]\r\nAccordingly, I now propose for your approval and election to nominate the Honorable Cesar Virata for the position of Prime Minister. [\r\n]\r\nI also nominate for your election and approval the Honorable Jose Ro\u00f1o as Deputy Prime Minis\u00adter. [\r\n]\r\nWith these changes that we have now concrete\u00adly made, the major direction for reconstruction of government has been laid. But these are only the beginning, and we must now proceed to bring to full fruition the establishment of the new govern\u00adment, and the adoption of a new program for that government.\r\nWe shall maintain and sustain this close col\u00adlaboration and unity of mind and action between the executive and the legislative until our goals shall have been fulfilled, and until the burdens shall have been lifted from us by the sovereign will of our people.\r\nWe begin this task with the nation never more closely united under one faith, with our people never more prepared for the tasks of reconstruc\u00adtion and development, and with the government never more stable and strong for the prosecution of the policies and programs that must be pursued.\r\nThree years ago, when the Batasang Pamban\u00adsa was first convened on June 12, 1978, if you will remember, I said before this august body:\r\nWe must attend to the continuing normalization of our political life, and the methodical construction of a truly demo\u00adcratic political order \u2026 and when at last the time should come when martial law can be lifted in our land, let us install in place of crisis government a fully democratic government that will embody the efficacy of democratic discussion and deliberation as a means for the achievement of nation at pur\u00adposes and aspirations.\r\nThat time has come. We have successfully hurdled the crucial passage from crisis government to a normal democratic government. We do not now note the importance of this passage but history will mark these critical times and this particular turn in our history. And now we pro\u00adclaim the birth of a New Republic in our country, whose shape, whose character, whose workings we are now privileged to build.\r\nWe have lived through a period of crisis and renewal in our land, the likes of which we have not known or attempted before, which we hope we will never see again. Just as it is fact that we have brought to life a new system of government in our country, so it is also fact that the people and the nation which will raise it to maturity are now liberated, as many of us are wont to say, from the shackles of the past and the fetters and struc\u00adtures and trends in our national history.\r\nTo understand what this form of liberation means is to realize what the last eight-and-a-half years have meant to the nation: What they have brought in terms of recovered authority and stability to government, in terms of direction and pro\u00adductivity to the national economy, in terms of equity and participation to the many sectors of society, in terms of vigor, strengthening of our culture and traditions as a people, and in terms or our newfound influence and position in the coun\u00adcils of the world to our foreign relations. [\r\n]\r\nWe look around us and we see that our insti\u00adtutions have grown in capabilities and resources, just as families and individuals have experienced new fulfillment in their quest for identity, dignity, and advancement.\r\nLet us look at the record.\r\nIn the eight-and-a-half years of crisis govern\u00adment, we dramatically defused the dangers of sub\u00adversion, sedition, rebellion, and secession in our land, which in 1972 had brought the Republic so close to ruin and collapse.\r\nWith peace and security, the consolidation of the authority of government has moved decisively into a solid position of leadership in national affairs, something that we had never known through all the years when we thought that to govern least was to govern best.\r\nDespite the adversities of the time, we sus\u00adtained our drive toward economic development at rates and levels even more impressive than those of the decade preceding it, when there was no crisis. Behind this impressive performance was the application of vigorous and responsive inter\u00adnal policies and enlightened economic management, which embraced the full range of economic con\u00adcerns and endeavors.\r\nWhen we say therefore that economic devel\u00adopment has resulted in the improvement of incomes and living conditions for our people, we do not merely cite statistical averages of benefits and in\u00adcomes. We mean that development has touched and even reshaped the lives of the great masses of our people.\r\nWe have already remarked upon the rise in incomes of the lower 50% of our population. We shall merely add here the revealing trend that income growth is seeping into all classes in so\u00adciety, raising the number and percentage of those earning P30,000 and more significantly.\r\nThe social gains and the overall growth of the sense of human dignity among Filipino citizens through health, education, housing, livelihood, and social security measures have been reported time and again, and may be reiterated here briefly.\r\nStatistics, however, will never tell the full story of how our nation and our society have changed. The final measure is how our people perceive the change in their status and well-being; in the sense of security of families and individ\u00aduals; in the rise of the once-bonded tenant farmer to dominion over his land and his toil; in the real share of the worker in the fruits of his labor; and in the development of local communities as authentic havens of communal life.\r\nThis perception of a people rising from stagnation and poverty is matched by a new sense of sovereignty and independence of their nation in its relations with other nations throughout the world.\r\nThis has been made possible by a foreign policy that again during this period irrevocably broke our long confinement to a vision of the world in Cold War terms, and opened us to the exploration and discovery of ties with Socialist countries, to our making\u2019 common cause with the whole of the Third World, and to the forging of community ties with our ASEAN neighbors.\r\nWe have attained a voice and influence in the councils of nations unheard of during the time when we were habitually mistaken for a surrogate of a global power. We have advanced our inter\u00adests, and we believe the interests of peace and pro\u00adgress in the world, by steadfastly looking to the ideals of cooperation among nations and of inter\u00addependence in the cause of meeting problems writ large on the global scene.\r\nThe momentum of reform during this critical decade of the crisis government has thrust our country irreversibly forward in its difficult journey towards national development. But however dedi\u00adcated our strivings, however remarkable the gains, we have only made a beginning.\r\nI put it to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Batasan, that in this time of general pessimism in the global economic environment, the moment is opportune for decisive action on our part; that in the uncertainty of the times, the sure road for us is one of enterprise and daring; and that in this period of beginning for our New Republic, the business of development must be the agenda of our nation now.\r\nThat agenda requires us to address the chal\u00adlenges of reducing further our population growth, of eliminating unemployment and underemployment, of raising productivity both in agriculture and in industry, of rectifying imbalance in regional de\u00advelopment, of relieving our high dependence on imported oil, of raising deficient domestic resource allocations, and of resolving problems both in the public and private sectors of our national life.\r\nUndoubtedly, for the decade of the eighties, energy will continue to be the burden of all coun\u00adtries with or without indigenous oil.\r\nDespite our best efforts in the past, energy con\u00adtinues to be one of the most vulnerable sectors of our economy, vulnerable because it is subject to external forces over which we have no control.\r\nIt will take much political will and resolution to attain our goals on energy. As of 1980 our dependence on foreign oil was reduced from 97% to 83%. The goal for 1985 is to re\u00adduce this to 50%. This does not take into account any possible sudden breakthroughs in non\u00adconventional sources of energy, like direct con\u00adversion of sunlight into electric energy through a cheaper method than now exists, or discovery of large deposits of oil in our country.\r\nThe Batasang Pambansa and the Cabinet must now attend to the nonconventional means of pro\u00adducing energy, like dendrothermal, hydroelectric (including mini-hydro), geothermal, coal, biogas, and so many others. It will be necessary for the members of the Batasang Pambansa to participate in the effort to encourage the development of these nonconventional sources of energy.\r\nAnother salient phase of our development pro\u00adgram is the production of food, sufficient and nutri\u00adtionally appropriate to feed 47.9 million Filipinos.\r\nIt cannot be denied that we have made notable breakthroughs by achieving self-sufficiency in rice and exporting surplus, distributing land transfer certificates (in 1972 we distributed land transfer certificates to only about 50 farmers) to rice and corn farmers, and cultivating cash crops, including coffee, cacao, and rubber.\r\nAt the same time the land reform program must be intensified to strengthen and broaden the mass base of our total national effort. In this direction, the following must be undertaken:\r\nOf course it must be taken into account that we have now reached the point where we must develop both production and marketing cooperatives. We must attend to food production as if we were just starting this program.\r\nIt will be necessary now to move into the period for the consolidation of resources in land reform.\r\nOur infrastructure development program will be made more responsive to efficiency, economy, broader coverage, and livelihood development. To\u00adwards this end, a reorientation of the content of programs, project design, and mode of execution will be undertaken.\r\nThe emphasis of the infrastructure program will continue to be power and electrification, of course, but we must also take into account irriga\u00adtion, transport, and all social infrastructure projects, especially the farm-to-market roads.\r\nIn terms of design, the program will propagate the use of construction materials indigenous to specific regions and locations, thereby encouraging local raw material production. In school buildings, for instance, we will make use of coconut lumber and brick materials wherever they are needed.\r\nA major restructuring program for industry has been started with the implementation of the following interrelated measures:\r\nIn the encouragement of the countryside in\u00addustries, I will have more to say about the Kilusang Kabuhayan.\r\nMeasures have also been undertaken to improve the efficiency of manufacturing industries to accel\u00aderate employment generation and to further stimu\u00adlate the growth of industry outside Metropolitan Manila.\r\nHighlighting the long-term industrialization program is the accelerated implementation of the 11 major industrial projects. These projects are expected to intensify the technological com\u00adponent of the industrial structure and the develop\u00adment of an efficient domestic intermediate goods industry.\r\nThe success of industrialization, however, will rely a great deal on our capacity to export our products.\r\nWe are strengthening the growth prospects of our exports through the establishment of more ex\u00adport processing zones throughout the country. I will have more to say on the matter of the creation of teams that will be sent to other countries to negotiate trade arrangements. We have already established three export zones, namely: Bataan, Baguio, and Mactan. In the future, we will con\u00adtinue to establish such zones in other parts of the country.\r\nThe basic reforms and programs affecting in\u00addustry exports, financial system, and energy are expected to have positive effects on the payment imbalance in the next few years. Our credit lines to the international financial markets remain open and favorable. Just recently, we reviewed with the International Monetary Fund the status of our financial program on which we have made some adjustments to accommodate additional credit needs, and they committed more than $1 billion in support of our projects. In fact, the World Bank has already invested several million dollars in one of the 11 industrial projects.\r\nIn this major thrust towards economic develop\u00adment, we shall seek as ever to enlist the assistance of the international community, wherever neces\u00adsary and appropriate.\r\nIn our bilateral economic relations, our basic thrust will be trade and economic diversification. We witnessed in recent years a gradual diversifica\u00adtion of our markets as we successfully tapped several nontraditional outlets such as the Middle East, the European Economic Community, the So\u00adcialist countries and the ASEAN.\r\nWith regard to our perennial trade deficits with the oil-producing countries of the Middle East, we have been trying to offset this imbalance through the employment of Filipino manpower in various development projects in those countries. At the same time, we have been supporting the efforts of the private sector in obtaining contracts in infra\u00adstructure and services in those countries.\r\nWhile we venture into the accelerated develop\u00adment of industry, agriculture, trade, and the other sectors of the economy, we shall continue to gear a major part of our programs to more equitable access by our people to social opportunities and to fuller development and utilization of our human resources.\r\nIn our family planning program, we shall con\u00adtinue to pursue the choice of conscience method, which grants each individual the choice between artificial birth control and the natural rhythm meth\u00adod of family planning. So far, this has been ac\u00adcepted by our people as successful in bringing our population growth rate down from 3.01% to 2.4%, but we now aim to bring this further down to 2%.\r\nExpanding medical services alone will not satis\u00adfy the growing health needs of our population, es\u00adpecially with the onset of inflation and resulting increases in the cost of food and other basic com\u00admodities. Thus, we have initiated a new approach to health care, the primary health care concept (PHC), which seeks the improvement and maintenance of the health status of the community through the active local participation of both the public and private sectors. The centerpiece of our current efforts is a barangay-based health and nutrition program.\r\nIn nutrition, the integrated food and nutrition plan will see to it that selected nutritious foods are available to our malnourished population, particu\u00adlarly the \u201cat-risk\u201d groups.\r\nWe shall and must continue to democratize ac\u00adcess to education at all levels in both the formal and nonformal education sectors. This is some\u00adthing which is equally addressed to the members of the Batasan as it is addressed to the Cabinet and the new Prime Minister.\r\nWe shall intensify efforts to further improve the quality of education. This we must also attend to. The most comprehensive improvement program of the entire education system is scheduled to begin in 1982.\r\nThe realignment of educational output with the demands of the labor market is now a major focus of our concern. We have stressed the training of middle- and high-level technical manpower. I have ordered the conversion of public high schools into technical, vocational, and technological or agricul\u00adtural high schools. The development of scientific courses is being encouraged to serve our technology requirements.\r\nThe upgrading and renewal of blighted urban communities and the acceleration of construction of new housing units have been, and will continue to be, our major undertakings. I ask the Batasan to support these efforts. We shall encourage low-cost housing designs and the more effective utiliza\u00adtion of local materials for housing construction to reach as many beneficiaries as possible\u2014a project that has been started by the Ministry of Human Settlements. And talking about this ministry, the policy thrust is the total development of communi\u00adties, and such development must move along the central core of livelihood, self-reliance, income generation, or in general, production by every person within the village.\r\nThe orientation of the New Society made it pos\u00adsible for us to evolve wise and appropriate labor and social policies which sought development based on social justice. The New Republic can do no less. We shall begin our efforts in this area with the pas\u00adsage of the long-awaited right-to-strike bill. Our adherence to the full application of labor stand\u00adards will, however, remain, to assure industrial peace which we need urgently and politically during this period.\r\nIn instituting reforms for the benefit of the greater masses of our people, our main concerns have been the visible disparities in our society and the lack of equal opportunities for the dispossessed, the deprived, and the disadvantaged to rise above their marginal existence. We have sought to pro\u00admote social justice through the strengthening of social services for the poor, the disadvantaged, and the needy.\r\nThese are the highlights of our national deve\u00adlopment program in the economic and social spheres, and these we shall now endeavor to fulfill with the complete leadership and dedication of the govern\u00adment and the participation of our people.\r\nOur work in reorganizing the government must begin with the sweeping reform of the very insti\u00adtutions which must lead our struggle for develop\u00adment. We have today the rare opportunity, conse\u00adquent to the establishment of our New Republic, to conduct a thorough reorganization of the govern\u00adment in order to enable it to serve the people more efficiently, more effectively, and more economically.\r\nThe numbers of ministries and similar agencies have been considerably lessened through reclassifi\u00adcation and integration in order that, among others, the extent of control and supervision is made more manageable.\r\nThis does not mean, however, that we shall depart from our goal of regionalization. On the contrary, regionalization may continue on a selec\u00adtive basis.\r\nThe most immediately visible manifestations of the realignment of the government machinery would, of course, be in the national, ministerial level. As already announced, we have reduced the number of cabinet portfolios to 18 through the merger of some and the conversion of others into staff agencies.\r\nI have decided to combine these ministries upon the recommendation of the Reorganization Com\u00admittee for many reasons, among which is efficiency, economy, and effectiveness:\r\nThe Ministry of Public Works with the Ministry of Public Highways; and the Ministry of Industry with the Ministry of Trade. It is to the credit of Minister Alfredo Juinio, Minister of Public Works, that he himself recommended the merger of the ministry that he headed with the Ministry of Public Highways to achieve a higher level of effi\u00adciency and bring down the cost of operation. At the same time, he requested that he be allowed to retire, having spent 42 years in the government.\r\nI propose that we commend Minister Juinio for this self-abnegation. [\r\n]\r\nThe same self-abnegation and concern for the public interest has prompted Minister Luis Villafuerte to urge strongly that the Ministry of Trade be likewise joined again with the Ministry of In\u00addustry, as it used to be some years ago. While accepting his recommendation, I have, however, asked him to manage our continuing and expanding international trade negotiations, of which there are 31 negotiations going on.\r\nI again commend to you the self-sacrifice by one of your members, Assemblyman Luis Villa\u00adfuerte. [\r\n]\r\nIn order that the Cabinet members may be able to take their oath of office, and in accordance with the recommendation of the Reorganization Com\u00admittee, I have the honor to sign before you the Executive Order which merges the ministries that I have already indicated: the Ministry of Public Works with the Ministry of Public Highways, and the Ministry of Industry with the Ministry of Trade.\r\nIn your presence, I sign this executive order; subject of course to detailed amplifying legislation or orders by the Batasang Pambansa under the guidance of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. [\r\n]\r\nUpon the recommendation of the minister in office, Minister Jose Leido, I am also effecting cer\u00adtain organizational changes in the Ministry of Na\u00adtural Resources. Minister Leido has suggested such internal reorganization and has asked that he be permitted to stand full-time with this august body for which he was elected.\r\nI also ask that he be commended for this action. [\r\n]\r\nAlso, on his request, therefore, I have permitted Minister Leido to retire from the ministry so that he could devote more time to his functions as mem\u00adber of this august body, and in his place, another member from Region IV, Assemblyman Teodoro Pe\u00f1a, has been appointed. [\r\n]\r\nAnother member of the Cabinet, Mr. Magno, has also asked that he be allowed to devote his time to full-time research which is his first love. Accordingly, I have appointed the Chancellor of the University of the Philippines in Los Ba\u00f1os, Dr. Emil Javier, as the new Chairman of the National Science Development Board. [\r\n]\r\nWith the savings that will be generated from the government reorganization and cost control estimated at about P1 billion, we shall be able to fund our national development effort.\r\nNow, let me talk about what I consider, and what may become, the most important strand in our strategy for development. This is the third strand and it involves a massive effort to awaken the sense of economic enterprise in our local com\u00admunities. This is the essence of what we announced during the caucus of the ruling political party as the Kilusang Kabuhayan. It was referred to ini\u00adtially as Kilusang Bayanihan but people might think it is all devoted to dancing and culture, so now it is called Kilusang Kabuhayan. This pro\u00adgram seeks to re-create presently depressed and unprogressive communities and villages into vital and active production units.\r\nThe Kilusang Kabuhayan probably should be not just an umbrella program for the livelihood projects but should be a national movement to spearhead the spiritual awakening of the country\u00adside for self-reliance, self-help, and self-determina\u00adtion, as well as the increase in the production of goods and services.\r\nAs the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan is the politi\u00adcal party for the New Republic, the Kilusang Kabuhayan shall be its fundamental concept and platform of national development.\r\nEconomic production is the core of this com\u00admunity enterprise. It is therefore logical to direct and contain the initial implementation of the move\u00adment in key program or project prototypes. These prototypes should be in strategic sectors and should be replicable across municipalities and provinces to establish a mass move for development. These prototypes are as follows:\r\nWhy do I speak of public markets? Because if we are to increase the production of sterile and stagnant villages at present, we will discover that 108 of our municipalities have no public markets. And it will be necessary to develop not only public markets but also warehouses and depositories for our products.\r\nIn short, the National Food Authority, which is now operating on a partial basis, will have to be supported in its effort to move the products from production areas to the market. This is the reason the administrator of the National Food Authority, Mr. Jesus Tanchanco, has been elevated to Cabinet rank. [\r\n]\r\nThe public market construction program should make available P70 million per year to construct 200 markets over a seven-year period in standard prototypes costing between P400,000 and P10 mil\u00adlion.\r\nA program therefore of public market and stor\u00adage construction and upgrading services becomes critical as a major component of the Kilusang Kabuhayan program.\r\nSince the Kilusang Kabuhayan is to be deve\u00adloped as a national movement, the element of train\u00ading, not only for human resource mobilization but for social reorganization, becomes critical. It is proposed that a training network be established at the University of Life to cover local government officials and Kilusang Kabuhayan leaders.\r\nWhile we are in the process of saving large dis\u00adtressed industries, it should be the policy of govern\u00adment to continue to extend total support to the small entrepreneurs.\r\nIn the current and coming year\u2019s appropria\u00adtions acts, we have identified close to a billion pesos in the budgets of various offices. Lump sum sav\u00adings may bring in another billion or two. I intend to propose to you that we utilize the amount to implement the Kilusang Kabuhayan; and thus, it will have an initial appropriation of anywhere from P1 billion to P3 billion. [\r\n]\r\nFinally, our program of government requires the strategic participation and support of this legis\u00adlative assembly, so that enabling legislation can set programs in motion, define guidelines for areas of activity, and gather together the whole of our ef\u00adforts into a coherent code of law and policy.\r\nIt is true that many of the measures pending before this body require further refinement of the provisions to adjust to the new needs and to re\u00adspond to new realities. But action must be taken not later but sooner.\r\nWe must review our basic policies from the viewpoint of the democratic revolution, the quiet revolution, which sought to radically restructure our system, our entire society without bloodshed. We must assess the means that were utilized to attain this objective.\r\nThe economic ideology is private enterprise with an egalitarian base that encourages the private sector to assume the initiative of development with the government setting up the inducements, the rewards, and the general atmosphere of encourage\u00adment. But at the same time, while we encourage private investment, it must now be agreed that we should regulate wealth so that it is not utilized to brutalize or degrade our people. This is a principle of faith with the New Republic. [\r\n]\r\nThe growing participation of labor in the profits of development should be maintained.\r\nThe agrarian reform program must now pro\u00adceed towards its logical next step, which involves, as I said, establishment of production and mar\u00adketing cooperatives as well as the pooling of re\u00adsources and facilities in the consolidation program of small farm units.\r\nThe New Republic draws its vitality from its roots in the villages. Barangay participatory de\u00admocracy must continue.\r\nNow, through the first three years of this As\u00adsembly, it has been its historic role to work in close concert with the President/Prime Minister in laying the course for political normalization.\r\nToday, with the birth of the New Republic, that role has fatefully passed from being a tran\u00adsitional parliament to practically, and de facto, the regular National Assembly. [\r\n]\r\nTo this new charge and this new responsibil\u00adity, the Batasan must now return the readiness, the probity, and the wisdom of an authentic seat of legislative power in our new government. [\r\n]\r\nHaving watched the conduct of the members of the Batasang Pambansa, I personally have no doubt that this Assembly shall live true to the high expectations of our people. [\r\n]\r\nOur faith is firm that this Assembly which was born in the womb of crisis, challenge, and reform will be equal to this charge and challenge, and will rise as a pillar of strength, of newfound strength, in our New Republic.\r\nIn this spirit and in that faith, I now reite\u00adrate and formally submit to you the nominations of those who shall be the leaders of the Batasang Pambansa: the Honorable Cesar E.A. Virata for Prime Minister [\r\n]; and for Deputy Prime Minister, the Honorable Jose A. Rono. [\r\n]\r\nIt is understood that the Prime Minister will concurrently be the Minister of Finance; and the Deputy Prime Minister will concurrently be the Minister of Local Government.\r\nI have already announced the members of the Cabinet which I have reorganized.\r\nWith reference to the Executive Committee, I wish to announce to you the following membership, based on the decision of the majority party: the Honorable Cesar Virata as Chairman [\r\n]; the Honorable Jose Rono as Vice Chairman [\r\n]; and the following as members: Minister Roberto Ongpin of Industry [\r\n]; Minister Juan Ponce Enrile of Defense [\r\n]; Mi\u00adnister Manuel Alba of the Budget [\r\n]; a Representative from the south, especially in Mindanao, the former Vice President and now As\u00adsemblyman, Emmanuel Pelaez [\r\n]; and the representative of the local executives, the Gover\u00adnor of the Province of Cebu, Governor Eduardo Gullas. [\r\n]\r\nWhile we shall maintain for the time being the membership of the Executive Committee at this level of seven members, it is my intention to slowly bring up its membership to 15 as provided for by our fundamental law and upon determination of the mechanics of adding to this body through con\u00adsultation with the majority party and the Cabinet, as well as the members of the Batasan. We shall move in that direction.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Batasang Pamban\u00adsa, it is now my honor to say that on this site now, during your meeting and upon your confirmation of my nominations, we start the new government of our land, and then shall begin the necessary and historic dialogue between the executive and the legislative authorities of government which shall define the modes, the ethics, the code, the policy, the rules of coordination and cooperation between these two bodies which in a parliamentary form of government are one and the same and are not separate.\r\nFinally, I ask for your support for our pro\u00adgram of government, as I freely give mine to the work of this Assembly, and let us now, God will\u00ading, consecrate ourselves to the long life and vitality of our New Republic.\r\nTo all of you, thank you and good day.

{"delivered": "1979-07-23 17:53:10+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 1979]\r\nThere can be no question now about the wisdom of that decision, nor of the orientation of the course that we have taken in the last seven years. The Re\u00adpublic has been saved and continues its vital existence notwithstanding the threat that sought to divide it, destroy it, and fragment it.\r\nOn the other hand, the world has grown more perilous since then. The problems have become more complex and critical; it was just possibly a stroke of good fortune, the generosity of Divine Providence, that we have meanwhile established a government strong enough to apply political reason and political resolution to cope with the crisis that has visited not only our nation but the world.\r\nOur experience, in simple summary, is this: In 1972, we established the crisis government in order to arrest the tide of turmoil, the course of chaos, and the momentum of the seven deadly threats to the Republic: insurgency, con\u00adspiracy, secessionists, criminality, graft and corruption, foreign intervention and manipulation, other forms of dissidence and subversion.\r\nThis extraordinary action, dramatic as it now appears, was taken within the framework of the legal order; in fact, an affirmation of the rule of law. Our initial successes were equally dramatic and extraordinary from all accounts. A new course was set for the nation which not a moment earlier was on the verge of dismemberment and ruin. However, no sooner were the seven deadly threats met when another crisis, this time not directly of our own making, threatened our national stability just as it disturbed the stability of other nations of the world. This was the oil crisis of 1973 to 1974. At the time, if you will recall, the Philippines was already drawing 95% of its commercial energy require\u00adments from petroleum, a trend that was determined in the early 50s all over the world because of the convenience and relatively lower cost of petroleum.\r\nRealizing the strategic sensitivity of ensuring our expedient and economical flow of oil from supply points to end consumers, I promulgated Presidential Decree 354 creating the Philippine National Oil Company, vesting it with corporate powers to engage in crude oil purchasing, marketing, refining, and distribution. Today, PNOC-commissioned tankers move anywhere from 90% to 100% of our imported crude oil.\r\nPNOC has also been instructed to initiate direct government-to-government contracts for the procurement of oil. In 1972, we did not have a single contract on a government-to-government basis. We were completely dependent on private oil marketers and suppliers. We are regarded, in this connection, as the first country to sign a government-to-government contract with Kuwait.\r\nThe economic record, therefore, for the last seven years, will clearly show that for all the political, social, and economic threats to the Republic, both internal and external, our government, our Republic, our people, one and in concert, succeeded in building a new society consonant with our historical aspirations.\r\nWe cannot, by any means, say that we have established an ideal social order, for to live in this world is fundamentally to struggle at every turn, but we have defused the forces of dismemberment, disunity, and destruction.\r\nStating this as early as 1973, when we observed the first year of the New Society, I nonetheless cautioned against complacency and backsliding, for the ills of the old society were not, and up till now have not been, completely up\u00adrooted from our midst. I said then, as I say it now, we should not delude our\u00adselves into complacency and false security. Real security depends on our continuing efforts. Sacrifices do not end, alertness does not lag when old problems are solved, for there are always new problems that confront us. These problems, in a world that has shrunk, come from without and not from within. Developing nations such as ours do not control the drift of international events. Even developed countries themselves are shaken by these events; they have not learned from these events, and when they are thus shaken, the whole world reels to the reverberations. We have one such phenomenon today.\r\nSo it is that we are now again faced with an energy crisis brought about by events beyond our control. But before dwelling at length on these, let me first assure you that despite the energy crisis that we are now experiencing, our gov\u00adernment intends to pursue its development goals, particularly those stated in the Five-Year Development Plan.\r\nOn the whole, policy directions for 1979 will be aimed at moving the economy closer to the target\u2014overall economic growth of 6.5%, as well as keeping the inflation rate within manageable levels. The oil price increases are related developments that have exceeded our original inflation assumption of 7% contained in the original Five-Year Development Plan. Nevertheless, the government will continue to intensify the efforts to contain inflation. Our experts have set a maximum tolerable level of 15%.\r\nThe world oil crisis today has become the single, most important issue to face the peoples of the world. A world leader has advanced the view that the crisis can only be met if the people consider the steps needed to meet the challenge as \u201cthe moral equivalent of war.\u201d\r\nIn this decade of energy scarcity, energy has become a common, although not a unifying, interest among developed as well as developing nations, of producers and consumers, of brilliant and common, ordinary men. To be sure, the oil crisis as we know it today is not mankind\u2019s first recorded encounter with something we can call an energy crisis. And it may well not be its last. Man has experienced the energy crisis in many forms in the past; as a labor scarcity in the age of the primitive hunter; as an animal scarcity in the age of the agricultural tiller; and now as petroleum scarcity in the age of the industrial processor.\r\nA lesson that we can learn from our past experience is simple: the impru\u00addence of being overly dependent on one key product or fuel. The petroleum story of the 70s appears no different from the past, so that it almost seemed natural that the world economy, functioning under the virtual monopoly of petroleum, had to stumble upon the crisis.\r\nWe have learned a lesson well, and our efforts are only limited by time as well as resources. To date, the government supplies 145,000 barrels per day or 64% of the country\u2019s total oil requirements. We are indeed happy to report that because of the energetic activities of the First Lady and Minister of Human Settlements, we have added to our supply 1,200,000 barrels annually from the People\u2019s Republic of China. At the same time, the concern of our friends and neighbors in Asia, most especially President Suharto, head of state of the Republic of Indonesia, has resulted in practically a swap of our surplus rice with their oil and an additional supply of 2 million barrels of oil annually from Indonesia.\r\nThese two sources just about cover whatever possible deficiencies there are going to be in the supply of oil in the Philippines in the immediate future.\r\nBut hand in hand with developing immediate administrative capabilities in the oil industry, which was brought about by the service contract and the discovery of oil in the Palawan area, the government has also taken a direct interest in the development of other indigenous energy resources. Again, with reasonable good foresight, we were able to lay down the institutional frame\u00adwork for geothermal development, as it was with oil exploration years before the 1973 oil embargo was declared. And today, as you know, the payoff is starting to materialize.\r\nThis monumental achievement, which I ascribe once again to the generosity of a Benevolent Providence as well as to the foresight of our people and the national leadership, this monumental achievement was made possible largely through an accelerated growth of oil exploration and development launched in 1972 with the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 87 on December 21, 1972, a few months after the proclamation of martial law.\r\nThe decree introduced the service contract to replace the concession system. A total of 30 service contracts has been granted over the various oil basins of the country. A total of 56 wells have been drilled, and within that time, we have managed six oil discoveries. In addition, seismic activities under other service contracts have opened up new areas for heretofore unexplored areas. It will be appreciated that a total of about $150 million has been sunk by oil prospectors in the continual search for oil.\r\nAs the tempo of oil exploration increase in the succeeding years, it is our hope that we will correspondingly increase our indigenous sources of other forms of energy. The strategy of the government in its dual approach to the energy problem is to accelerate the development of alternative energy resources including coal, geothermal, and nonconventional energy. I need not go into how coal production has jumped by almost 100% over the last year or two. And we are now moving from oil-fired generators to coal-fired generators. We have changed the leases of coal land into service contracts under the same theory that we adopted with respect to the service contracts in oil prospecting.\r\nMeanwhile, the nine-year geothermal effort has generated a total of 415 megawatts in field stream capability. The exploration or development of geo\u00adthermal energy has been advancing since the pioneering work in the geothermal field in Tiwi in 1972. At present, you are well aware that there are three fields being developed: these are Tiwi, Makban or the Makiling-Banahaw complex which is barely 40 km from Manila and therefore may become the principal source of electric energy in the capital area soon, and the Leyte geothermal project. At least, we still have another source of energy in the Batasang Pambansa.\r\nIn the field of nonconventional energy, a large degree of research and development work is now being carried out to adapt promising technologies to Philippine conditions. The national nonconventional energy program was introduced in January 1977 when 1068 was enacted. Since then, some 42 projects in the areas of solar, wind, and biomass energy have been administered. These include the pilot electrification of an entire village or barangay using agricultural waste as fuel, industrial solar water heating, and biogas generation. As of end of the year 1978, 344 biogas plants have been constructed; the majority are privately installed units, less than one-third being government demonstration units. The Central Luzon region accounts for nearly one-fourth of the totally installed units in the country. Overall, nearly 60% of the biogas units are in Luzon. It is now the policy of government to spread out this particular experience not only in Southern Luzon but also in the Visayas and in Mindanao.\r\nIn addition, the nonconventional program will devise technologies which will reduce consumption even of conventional fuel; for instance, one such project is the technological feasibility of utilizing alcogas as motor fuel. I have received reports from Commodore Protacio, head of the Sta. Barbara project under the Office of the President and currently attached as one of the assistants in the Ministry of Energy, to the effect that even low-grade alcohol which had been rejected because of its water content can, with the use of the device known as \u201calco-tipid,\u201d be used as supplementary fuel for motor vehicles. This device separates water from alcohol as it is being used in the engine. And it can be easily made from local materials and does not require any engine alteration for its installation. The new process will be used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines first and then by other vehicles of government and later by private vehicles.\r\nA support institutional program to include nonconventional technologies such as biogas and solar drying in the regular curricula of agricultural colleges and universities and selected trade schools is now under coordination between the various ministries. The Ministry of Human Settlements will spearhead the rural proliferation campaign.\r\nAs a basic policy, the nonconventional energy program aims to shorten research and development work through judicious selection of technologies and by applying relatively available technologies in appropriate utilization modes. Moreover, the nonconventional program is geared to benefit the rural sector, and most of the projects demonstrate nonconventional energy utilization for localized energy systems.\r\nWe are now on a threshold of a new era, a transition from an age of heavy dependence on oil as a principal energy source. It is unfortunate that the world has developed such a strong dependence on oil to the extent that the weaning process is proving to be traumatic for many nations in the world. And the Phil\u00adippines is not an exception.\r\nWe have to realize, however, that the decades of the 80s and perhaps well into the turn of the century do not offer us any relief from the energy crisis as we know it today, unless we carefully plan to live with what is turning out to be the realities of our times. We have to live with the fact that we cannot continue to depend on an unstable and depletable energy source, much less an important one. The level of energy independence that any country enjoys is now directly related to its political and economic independence. Not only must we strive to develop alternative energy resources to oil: We must develop what we now have indigenously for us to feel any significant amount of security or independence. In the face of this crisis, we can at least rest assure that the government will continue to provide the same quality of leadership that has to dale minimized the effects of this worldwide crisis in our country. The same kind of foresight will characterize our planning efforts in the continuing campaign to achieve greater energy independence.\r\nAnother dimension of this issue is that while supply may be more readily available, the price of crude oil in the world markets can only be expected to rise further. Another meeting is scheduled by OPEC before the end of the year, which can only mean additional costs to the oil-importing nations of the world. Right now rationing appears to me a remote possibility, even as we restrict the sales of petroleum products to the 1978 level which is equivalent to 84 million barrels.\r\nAll this will prove crucial because the world this year experienced a se\u00adquence of price increases for crude oil. We started the year with $12.70 per bar\u00adrel, which went up to $14.55 plus a surcharge of $1 per barrel in April. Just last June, however, the price was increased to $18 per barrel for Saudi Arabian crude to a high of $23.50 for other crudes. This represents an overall increase of 27%. As a result, therefore, the oil bill this year is expected to account for at least 26% of the total imports, or more than double the 1973 frac\u00adtion. We will spend about $1.5 billion for oil this year. In 1972, we spent $150 million.\r\nOur lifestyle, as with other countries, will necessarily have to change. Energy conservation is now a value that must be cultivated in our children and among our people almost as intensely as patriotism and dedication to the mother country. For today, many of us must learn to live without some of the con\u00adveniences or luxuries that are now part of the lifestyles of those in the upper socioeconomic level. It is to this level of the society that we direct our appeal for energy conservation, in the same way that we appeal to developed nations to trim their energy appetites.\r\nThe government will continue its efforts to make the country self-reliant in energy through accelerated development of indigenous alternative resources. We will continue to provide the kind of planning to our energy program with the kind of foresight that has thus far minimized the effects of this year\u2019s crisis on the lives of most of our people.\r\nI have often paid tribute to the ability of the Filipino to weather any crisis that threatens to disrupt me tranquility of his daily pattern of living. We have faced many crises in the past and we have always come out a better and stronger breed of people. It is a small comfort, of course, for our people to know that we are experiencing the same difficulties as the rest of humanity. In fact, the im\u00adpact of today\u2019s energy crisis, from alt indications, appears to be the hardest on people living in developed countries of the world because it has abruptly caused a change in their accustomed lifestyle. The reaction, in fact, of many of these people is a feeling that somebody, somewhere has deprived them of their perceived right to use energy as they please. In many cases, the reaction of these people, particularly those in big countries like the U.S., has been violent.\r\nWe in the developing world, particularly the Filipinos, perhaps, are better equipped to weather this crisis, for we have long been used to deprivation and impoverishment. We are not only more patient but, perhaps, more resilient to adapt to the changing environment, more ingenious in providing for our needs by whatever means, and less dependent on the machines that have become so much a part of daily existence in the developed world.\r\nI should like to once again express my confidence in our ability to live with, adjust, and meet the energy crisis. As our people realize the importance of this issue, I am confident that they will positively read in the knowledge that indi\u00advidual response to this crisis is as important as what governments can and are now doing to minimize the effects of this crisis on the people.\r\nI have dwelt at some length on the problem of energy because it is the primary concern of all our people. On the other hand, the energy problem will long remain the controlling factor in our continuing struggle with other deve\u00adloping nations for economic and social emancipation. To many economists and social thinkers, this objective is a dream that seems to be receding, for in their judgment, the human prospect as a rule is horrible. I must say, however, that the times may be bleak, but the worst thing that could happen to mankind is for its leaders to listen to the voice of despair and pessimism. While it is true that the problems of mankind are now gigantic and crucial, it is not the first time that man himself has faced seemingly insurmountable problems. I agree with the wisdom of those who hold, and I quote, \u201cthat the pessimism about man serves to maintain status quo.\u201d\r\nWith this in mind, let us go to the other sectors of the national economy. With respect to prices, the increase in the price of oil will pose, and continue to pose, a major problem and will critically influence the expansion of the econ\u00adomy for the remaining months of 1979.\r\nThe increase from $14.92 per barrel to $18.97 effective July 1, 1976, means an increase of 27%. Translated into domestic prices, this would mean an average increase of 20.4% in the prices of petroleum products. Because of this and related developments, we will exceed our original inflation assump\u00adtion of 7%, as I have already stated. Nonetheless, it is the intention of government to exert, intensify, and increase all existing efforts to hold it down to around 15%.\r\nThe times are difficult and we have to call for sacrifice on the part of every\u00adone. We are doing all we can to cushion the inflationary effects of oil price increases; however, we can succeed only to some extent in protecting ourselves from the full impact of actions taken abroad. Prices of such commodities as oil are beyond the control of small nations like the Philippines. Considering our limited domestic oil resources and the need to keep the oil industry viable, it will be necessary for the government and the private sector, the consumers and the producers, to now move together in unison to attain solutions to each and every aspect and dimension of the problem.\r\nI have spoken of conservation. Now let me move to what I consider also an important aspect of prices: food. For food constitutes about half of the consu\u00admer\u2019s budget. For this reason, government\u2019s anti-inflation policy must continue to place primary stress on expanding food production. In the past, government has launched a successful technology package to further improve agricultural production\u2014Masagana 99, Maisan, and other programs pertaining to agricultural productivity have proven to be successful. So much so, I am told, that we have a surplus of about 500,000 tons of rice available for export. We are beginning to export; in the last meetings with various countries, we have agreed to export part of this rice in view of the fact that the next harvest seems to be good. And our warehouses are bulging with rice.\r\nIf you will remember, in 1972, we imported $600 million worth of rice as we did in 1970 and 1971. Before 1973, we were a deficit country. Every year before that, we imported rice in various quantities and amounts\u2014anywhere from $100 million to $600 million a year, depending on the climate and on the harvest of our farms. After the agricultural development program, specifically the program of irrigation, Masagana 99, transfer of technology, the credit program for the farmers, and the land reform program\u2014although the projec\u00adtions were that for the first four years we would continue to be a deficit country, surprisingly we became self-sufficient in rice and now have a surplus.\r\nWe are moving this experience, successful as it has been, from the produc\u00adtion of grain to the production of all types of protein, vegetable and animal. In order to maintain the expected moderate increments in livestock and poultry, the Agricultural Investment Priorities Plan (AIPP) has already given priority to livestock production, fishery, poultry, agriculture, and dairy.\r\nIn the area of agrarian reform, greater emphasis should be placed on the leasehold, on land transfer activities, as well as on settlement projects. The cooperatives must continue to be encouraged. Agrarian reform, I must empha\u00adsize, is the bedrock of our social transformation, for it relates directly to our revolution of the poor, which is the basis of our New Society.\r\nI need not talk about the fishery sector, for as you know we have started the Biyayang \u201979 Program, a supervised credit scheme for small fishermen. And at the same time, we have released a massive amount of credit for the develop\u00adment of all types of fishery resources, patterned after the Masagana 99.\r\nAlongside this program, government has started to initiate complementary projects such as government procurement schemes and the establishment of cold storage facilities. All these are designed to keep the country from spending precious dollar reserves for the importation of food products.\r\nTogether with increased agriculture and fishery production, the provision of environmental safeguards to maintain the quality of life will be a major con\u00adcern. Toward this end, the proper management of the country\u2019s natural resources should be continuously pursued.\r\nFor the forestry sector, therefore, I reiterate the continuance of the policy that we have initiated\u2014that we must ultimately end up with the total ban and prohibition on the export of unworked logs.\r\nThe industrial sector will continue to set the pace for the economy\u2019s expan\u00adsion, but steps must be taken to alleviate the undesirable effects of inflation, Foreign investment will continue to be tapped and encouraged; the incentives will be maintained, if not increased. The capabilities of Filipino managers and entrepreneurs will not be overlooked, of course, in our reception of foreign in\u00advestment. They are a source of capital and a medium for the transfer of tech\u00adnology.\r\nTalking about the transfer of technology, I have just created a service within the Technology Resource Center that can link source and mobilize technol\u00adogical expertise in both government and private sectors here and abroad for preinvestment and project development requirements of a client technology user.\r\nThe government has invested funds and time as well as talent and organiza\u00adtion in scientific research such as the National Science and Development Board, the Philippine Council for Agricultural Research and Resources, the Plant Breeding Institute, the International Rice Research Institute, the Bureau of Plant Industry researches, the Bureau of Forest Products researches, and many other projects of government that have come up with breakthroughs in many fields and should have been utilized a long time ago in either industry or agriculture and other areas of the economy. But this has not been so. The general assumption has been that once a technology is developed to commercial stage, the market machinery will automatically lead firms to adapt and invest in the technology. But this is not happening.\r\nThe critical gap is in the preinvestment and project development stage ap\u00adplying improved technology. Technology users, particularly firms of small capital base, cannot invest in these high-risk front-end costs. And these are not acceptable financing risks in the banking world. Furthermore, there is no sys\u00adtem linking users to technology information and expertise suitable to both gov\u00adernment and private sectors here and abroad.\r\nThere is a sufficient number of Filipino scientists in the Philippines as well as abroad. Abroad, I count about 6,000, more than 6,000, who are ready to help in this endeavor. But the connecting link between technology users in industry and agriculture and the scientists does not exist. I have therefore created such a link, and this is the service corps as well as its funding. We have to establish a government fund to be known as the Technology Delivery Fund, which can be recovered through the proceeds of viable projects implemented by the Tech\u00adnology Resource Center of the Philippines, and form an intermediary organiza\u00adtion that will mobilize the supply of experts from government and private sec\u00adtors to assist the technology users.\r\nOf course, no one is compelled to utilize the services of this corps, but once they use such services they will have to pay for these on the basis of the viability of the project. I therefore created the Management Advisory Council, com\u00adposed of government people, to be chairmaned by the chairman of the Re\u00adorganization Commission, Dr. Armand Fabella, with the Deputy Minister of Human Settlements as vice chairman, the Presidential Assistant for Economic and Developmental Affairs, Mr. Ruben Ancheta, the Deputy Minister for the Budget, Dr. Manuel Alba, and a representative from the National Science Development Board, the chancellor of U.P. Los Banos, and the chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines, and a representative from the Tech\u00adnology Transfer Board as members. This ties up the general efforts on the part of government to harness all available resources, especially in science and re\u00adsearch, to maintain the momentum of progress that we have initiated in Philip\u00adpine society.\r\nThis does not mean, however, that we are going to waste our funds in re\u00adsearches. These researches have already been made in other countries. This is precisely the role of the Technology Resource Center which will act on the ins\u00adtructions of the technology group transmitted by me through the Minister of Energy. And this particular transfer of energy will probably have special application in the researches on energy.\r\nAt this stage, I wish to call attention to the fact that the comprehensive, mas\u00adsive program of research and development on energy will cost half a billion pesos annually. Because of this, I am constrained to propose the addition of a tax on the energy using sectors that have the highest capacity to pay.\r\nBecause I presume this assembly to be enlightened about the very real threat of the energy problem to our national security, I request all of you to support this proposal to increase the specific tax on gasoline by a modest three centavos per liter\u2014a greatly reduced figure from the five-centavo tax this R&D program will require. I have ordered that the tax figure be reduced because I feel that the people cannot afford the high tax. The reduced tax will involve the least dislocation in the economy. Three centavos per liter cannot be too high a price to pay for stability, security and survival.\r\nIt will be necessary for the Batasang Pambansa and the executive depart\u00adment to now move on to the plan to restructure tariffs as an affirmation of our commitment to fight protectionism and to work for free trade among countries. The country\u2019s export drive must not be compromised by the increased cost of petroleum products. Solid export performance will spur the growth of the Phil\u00adippine economy and alleviate the balance of payments (deficit) posed by the energy crisis.\r\nThe procedural aspects of exportation must be looked into. I ask the Bata\u00adsang Pambansa to help in simplifying such procedures. Our economic develop\u00adment, limited as it is by the energy crisis, must not be further decelerated by bureaucratic delays. Temporary assistance measures in favor of export-oriented industries that are severely affected by the energy crisis must be designed and implemented. Measures must be designed to encourage industries to shift to alternative sources of energy other than petroleum.\r\nI need not go into credit policies. For as you know, largely as a result of speculative importation for inventory buildups in the face of another round of oil price increases, the demand for credits soared. To control liquidity expan\u00adsion and tone down inflation, various contractionary measures were instituted by the Central Bank. We have successfully kept liquidity expansion at 17%, well within the set ceiling of 20%, and this has moderated inflation\u00adary pressures.\r\nBut recently the Central Bank rediscount window has been reopened, strictly on a selective basis, however.\r\nI have directed a restudy and reassessment of the capital program of our government. I ask the Batasang Pambansa to participate in this effort.\r\nIn view of the current energy situation, the 1979 budget is expected to be ad\u00adversely affected due to the following major factors: (1) increased budgetary out\u00adlays to finance the increased cost of priority activities, especially infrastructure; (2) adjustments in current operating expenditures; and (3) additional funding re\u00adquirements of government corporations, especially those with international commitments.\r\nThese pressures are expected to inflate the budgetary deficit from P5.5 to P6.5 billion. However, we have imposed ceilings on the expansion of current government operating expenditures. If you will remember, when I first became President, the current operating expenditure then was as high as 85%. We knocked it down to 70% and then 67%. And now we have set a ceil\u00ading of 65% for the current operating expenditure in order that there may be funds available for capital expenditures especially for infrastructure, power, and food production.\r\nTo minimize the impact of the oil price increases on the country\u2019s capital program, a move has been made to review the capital projects of the Ministry of Public Highways, Ministry of Public Works, and of government corporations attached to these ministries. This is to identify the projects most essential to the attainment of the objectives of the development plan and the present external conditions. Projects thus identified will then be given priority in capital outlays.\r\nI do not know of any men or women more capable and better qualified to de\u00adtermine the priorities of projects in the capital program than the members of the Batasang Pambansa. I therefore request that the members actively participate in the reassessment of the various projects of the capital program of the govern\u00adment.\r\nIt will be necessary to increase the sources of income of government. This will of necessity include taxation. There are no easy and soft choices whenever we are confronted with crisis. It is one of the most difficult obligations of leadership to impose a lax at a time when people are already suffering from high prices. However, there are no alternatives. Our options are closed. It will be necessary, however, for the Batasang Pambansa to help in the study to improve the tax collection machinery of government.\r\nI request that the energy demonstrated by the members of the Batasang Pambansa in what sometimes may be called \u201cperipheral areas of interest\u201d now go into this more solid and substantial requirements of our economy and our survival. It will be necessary of course to go into various specific taxes. We must restructure, for instance, taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. There must be a consolidation and reduction of taxes on hotel room occupancy and the removal of present exemptions therefrom for certain tourist groups, the consolidation and revision of the amount of the documentary and science stamp taxes and the reimposition of the 3% contractor\u2019s tax on agents and the contractors for embroidery apparel for export, and an increase in the fixed taxes on certain businesses.\r\nGovernment will probably have to move into direct taxation more and more. This has been our basic policy from the beginning.\r\nIn consideration of the revenue target for 1980 of around P31.7 billion, the following package of tax measures may have to be considered by the Batasang Pambansa: (1) a uniform franchise tax; (2) an upward division of the percentage tax on dealers and securities and leading investors; (3) separate taxation of capital gains from sale of real property; (4) manpower training tax on Filipino professionals and nonprofessionals leaving the country to compensate for the brain drain; and (5) minimum income tax on all those exempt from filing income tax.\r\nIn addition to this, the government may have to use taxation as a regulatory tool to curb the wasteful consumption of energy. In this connection, we are con\u00adsidering an upward revision of the specific tax rate on certain fuel items and the imposition of an energy tax on electric power consumption in excess of a certain minimum.\r\nExport and premium taxes will be reviewed with the view to supporting our thrusts in export expansion and diversification.\r\nWith respect to international relations, I don\u2019t think that there is any further need for me to clarify what is quite well-known to most of the members of the Batasang Pambansa.\r\nWhile the presentation that I have just made calls for measures which will be necessary for a major readjustment period in the Philippines, I believe that we can manage through the period, although heroic efforts will be needed.\r\nWe find ourselves concerned and involved, of course, in the Indochinese tensions. Events in Indochina and the invasion of Cambodia, the counterinva\u00adsion of Vietnam by China, the confrontation along the Thai-Khmer border raise the specter of vulcanizing or fragmenting the Indochinese region.\r\nThen we have the problem of the boat people. I have this to say, however. Whatever may be the source of the problem, whether it is the Middle East, the Southeast, or anywhere else, let us reiterate our stand. The stand of our people is historical. We do not intend to get enmeshed in the internal problems of other nations, nor do we want any interference in ours. But we pray that the world may solve its problems in the spirit of brotherhood\u2014the spirit to which as a nation we address ourselves. It is later than people realize that the world cannot afford greed and power hunger. These are the twin vices of an abundant world. But the world is no longer as abundant as it used to be. The world\u2019s resources are getting scarcer while the population is getting bigger and bigger. By the year 2000, the world\u2019s total population is conservatively estimated to be 6 billion, four-fifths of which will be in the Third World\u2014Asia, Africa, and Latin Ame\u00adrica. Eighty percent of Asia\u2019s population will be below 40 years of age, the majority of which will be minors or nonadults. The economic, social, and pol\u00aditical implications are appalling.\r\nBut let us not fear the future. No matter how grim it may appear, let us look it straight in the eye. For fear will weaken us. Let us not lose confidence in our\u00adselves. As we said earlier, resiliency is our greatest asset as a people.\r\nOn the plus side, we have reason to be optimistic. We have friendly neigh\u00adbors who have expressed their desire to cooperate with us. There are powerful nations who are concerned about our security and at the same time very res\u00adpectful of our independence and integrity.\r\nThe powerful nations such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and the People\u2019s Republic of China have expressed their desire to maintain peace in the world. Talks regarding arms limitations have gained in the past few years. The powerful nations have also been concerned and have been very helpful in the economic development of the developing countries.\r\nWe may say that the great problems of the world are passing storms. But while fear may be fatal, complacency will certainly be disastrous. Our ability thus far to weather all storms, external and internal, should not delude us into thinking that the quality and nature of present approaches are enough to weather present and coming crises.\r\nThose of us who believe that the time has come to rest, to let go of our com\u00admand of the situation, to relax and simply indulge are being suicidal and live in a fool\u2019s paradise.\r\nIn this age, more than ever, and in the Philippines particularly, as with other developing nations, the absence of a political bond with the future casts doubts on the ability of nation-states or socioeconomic orders to take the measures needed to mitigate the problems of the future. The aggravating factor is that the future problems are intruding into the present. And we cannot close our eyes to them.\r\nEconomists speak of a time discount in which people would prefer present indulgence to future rewards. For the future is so distant. But anyone familiar with future shock will know that the future is not distant at all. The bromide that it is later than you think is truer in the present age than any time in the past.\r\nTime and again we have emphasized the wisdom of political scientists and philosophers. The world, the nations need to exercise their political will for the good of all mankind. One cannot have political power without political obe\u00addience. One cannot have a strong government without a sense of national iden\u00adtity. And one cannot conquer the problems of man without identification with the future.\r\nThe leadership that the human predicament calls for requires the capacity to learn the resiliency to take advantage of the forces of change, the sophistication to innovate, and the wisdom to distinguish between what needs to be done and what needs to be delayed.\r\nLeadership is not just one man but an aggrupation. There is the aggrupation called the \u201cexecutive group.\u201d And there is the aggrupation known as the \u201clegislative group\u201d or in the parliamentary system, the \u201cgovernment.\u201d And there is the aggrupation referred to as the \u201cnation.\u201d And this is the reason why I have called the elections and the organization of the Batasang Pambansa, com\u00ading after the formation of the barangays as a necessary step towards the comple\u00adtion of our political transformation and development. These actions followed the timetable which, I would like to think, took into account the desires and capacities of our people for political transformation. Some say that the timetable has been slow. Others say it has been too fast. But I am optimistic that further developments in the world and in our country will again provide a pro\u00adphetic dimension to this timetable.\r\nWe cannot move too fast. We dare not move too slowly. We must pace our actions according to the heartbeat of our people and the times.\r\nFor these reasons, since world and national conditions require certain qual\u00adities of leadership, today I am announcing the reorganization of the Cabinet.\r\nUnder the continuing reorganization program, which the Batasang Pambansa authorized the President to undertake, there has been created by Exec\u00adutive Order a new ministry, the Ministry of Transportation and Communica\u00adtions. Taken out of the original Ministry of Public Works, Transportation, and Communications, this Ministry of Transportation and Communications shall be the primary policy planning, programming, coordinating, implementing, re\u00adgulating, and administrative-executive arm of the government in the promotion, development, and regulation of a dependable and coordinated network of trans\u00adportation and communications. It shall guide government and provide investments in the development of the country\u2019s entire model transport and communi\u00adcations system in the most practical, expeditious, and orderly fashion for maximum safety, service, and cost-effectiveness. It shall seek to attain technic\u00adal and economic, as well as other conditions, for the continuing viability of transport and communications and reorganize the postal system of the country.\r\nThe Ministry shall be composed of the ministry proper, the Office of the Minister, the administrative service, financial and management service, and a planning service. It shall have four bureaus, namely: the Bureau of Land Trans\u00adportation, the Bureau of Air Transportation, the Bureau of Telecommunica\u00adtions, the Bureau of Posts and the National Communications Commission.\r\nI hereby appoint as acting minister of Transportation and Communica\u00adtions, Mr. Jose Dans, and as consultant, Mr. Cesar Zalamea.\r\nI have also created a new office which shall be the liaison between the national government and the two autonomous governments of Regions IX and XII. This office shall initially be known as the Commission on Islamic Affairs. I have designated, in addition to his other duties, the present commander of the Southern Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Admiral Romulo Espaldon, as the first commissioner of Islamic Affairs.\r\nIt is now necessary to upgrade the efforts of youth and athletic develop\u00adment. Accordingly, I have promoted the incumbent general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, Mr. Nereo Andolong, to the rank of Deputy Minister for Youth and Athletic Development, and have appointed as general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes its present assistant general manager, Mr. Mario Rama.\r\nTwo members of the Cabinet have been asking to be retired for the past several years, but we requested that they continue in office until we could obtain the best possible replacements. I refer to the two venerable gentlemen, the gen\u00adtlemen holding the position of Minister of Education, Mr. Juan Manuel, and the Minister of Health, Clemente Gatmaitan.\r\nI have now accepted their retirement, and I have appointed to the Ministry of Education, the present and incumbent president of the University of the Phil\u00adippines, Dr. O.D. Corpuz.\r\nAfter consultation with the various sectors of the medical profession, including the incumbent, I have appointed as Minister of Health the present director of the Quezon Institute, Dr. Enrique Garcia.\r\nThe Minister on Highways has long requested to be allowed to retire for va\u00adried reasons including that of health. But in view of the investigations that were being conducted which reflected upon his good name, he had requested that the investigations be terminated, at least, with respect to him. Although he is not a party dependent and respondent to any of these charges, I thought it best and proper that he be kept during the conduct of such investigations.\r\nNow that the investigations indicate he has had nothing to do whatsoever with the dishonesty and corruption in that Ministry, I have accepted his request that he retire.\r\nI realize the many sacrifices of many of the members of the Cabinet who have had to give up their positions in the private sector which were more remunerative, many times more remunerative than membership in the Cabinet. Among those who have sacrificed for so long are the Secretary of Finance whom we borrowed for a few years, the Secretary of Economic Planning, and the Minister of Industry, Mr. Vicente Paterno, whom I now ask again to sac\u00adrifice and take over the portfolio of the Ministry of Highways. He also holds the mission to be the troubleshooter for the President for the entire Cabinet.\r\nAt the same time, I am afraid, I have again engaged in drawing from the private sector; on the recommendation of the Honorable Vicente Paterno him\u00adself and other specialists in this area, I have appointed as the Ministry of Indus\u00adtry, Mr. Roberto Ongpin.\r\nThe same situation obtains with respect to the Ministry of Trade; Minister Troadio Quiazon has asked to be moved to more interesting activities, since he is more of a lawyer than a trader. Accordingly, I have accepted his retirement as Minister of Trade, and I have appointed a member of the Batasang Pambansa as Minister of Trade, Delegate Luis Villafuerte.\r\nThe Honorable Acting Minister of Justice, Minister Catalino Macaraig, has been doing a yeoman\u2019s job in the performance of his task. It has become, how\u00adever, necessary to stabilize the operations of the Ministry of Justice. In accord\u00adance with tradition and practice, I appoint a member of the Batasang Pambansa as the Minister of Justice. He is a former Justice of the Court of Appeals, and now chairman of the Commission on Safety of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, Delegate Ricardo Puno.\r\nIt has been the practice agreed upon by the members of the Batasang Pam\u00adbansa and the members of the Cabinet to appoint more ministers of state, especially those representing the regions that are not represented in the Cabinet these days.\r\nAccordingly, I hereby appoint as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, the former Vice President and former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Delegate Emma\u00adnuel Pelaez.\r\nI also appoint as Minister of State for Social Services, the delegate from Marinduque, Delegate Carmencita Reyes.\r\nAnd as Minister of State for Local Governments and Community Develop\u00adment, the delegate from Agusan del Norte, Delegate Antonio Tupaz.\r\nAnd that, my friends of the Batasang Pambansa, finishes my task, the cere\u00admonial task of giving you an insight into what I consider the state of the nation.\r\nNow, may I say, we have no time to lose. We cannot pause. Let us go back to work.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},

Sapagka\u2019t wala pa ang ad interim National Assembly at ang katotohanan ay ang mga barangay ngayon ang sandigan at tunay na pinanggagalingan ng kapangyarihan ng buong pangasiwaan at pamahalaan ng Republika ng Pilipinas.\r\nI have invited the barangay leaders to join in these ceremonies to remember the 21st of September which we have denoted as Thanksgiving Day. I say thanksgiving because, as you know, it was on this day that you and I by compact agreed to create a new nation, strengthen the Republic, and meet the threat that would have destroyed the work of centuries. It is with a sense of fulfillment, a feeling of satisfaction and of achievement that I address you today, but it is not unmixed with a little anxiety.\r\nTwo years ago we sought to transform our nation. We established what we called the New Society. We created hope out of despair.\r\nWe gave every man, woman, and child in this country not only a new hope, not only a new promise, but also a new charge, a new responsibility, a new burden. We gave our people a new vision of what they are, but more than this, what they can be. We sought to teach them the meaning of one nation, claiming the labors of all her children for a common feeling, a common dream, a common destiny. But at the same time, we sought from everybody not only dedication but sacrifice.\r\nI am very happy indeed to listen to Atty. De Guzman make the pledge, in the name of all the barangays to strengthen the Republic and to attain the dreams and vision of the New Society. I am happy to receive the pledge of all the baranggays\u201433,000 in the rural areas, 8,000 in urban areas\u2014to dedicate themselves to one thing\u2014sacrifice, not for self, not for family, but sacrifice for the nation, sacrifice for the country.\r\nI am happy to hear that your faith shall not be shaken by any temporary reversals or setback, however long these might delay the eventual victory. In a sense that victory is already here. But there are faithless men, whose arrogance and indifference to our goals are still a source of anguish on the part of many in our country. It is a faithlessness that goes against the very roots of our reforms and will surely return us to anarchy, the corruption, and the special privilege we have dislodged from our society.\r\nI have spent many long nights on the persistent cancer of our society. I am sure many of you, like me, feel this with deep personal affliction.\r\nYet this is a problem that cannot be wished away. We solved it once, but it recurs and sometimes it comes back bigger and more difficult. And so I have traveled in the past year throughout the land. You have seen me amongst you.\r\nI have met with our people and talked to them of their expectations and dreams, what they want government to do for them, what they expect to get from our New Society. I have heard the same voice, repeating itself over and over, seeking an end to exploitation, injustice, poverty, and the reign of privilege. I have seen the same face, worn-out by betrayed promise and hope, begging for the attention that has been promised the small man for whom the democratic revolution was launched. I have seen the impatience and sometimes the frustration of farmers and workers who look to much more than what they are getting or what they used to get from the very men and women and the institutions which are supposed to serve them.\r\nAnd I have retained in my heart the lament of those who feel that only the President cares, only the President listens, only the President acts. And I have come to speak to you of this today.\r\nFor this is not the transformation that we have sought. This is not the change that we want. The society we seek is not one in which compassion, justice, and duty come alone from one man, the President, but one in which all these may be expected from everyone, bureaucrat and citizen alike.\r\nOur support for the New Society will be known not by what they say of our leaders in government, but by what we do to share their responsibilities. Our people need less of men who will say the New Society is good but more of men who will contribute what they can to give meaning to our efforts and to our words.\r\nThis is why I feel, more than ever, the need for us to close ranks. To unite in the awareness that the gravest threat to our nation today is not the problem of rising costs (although this is a serious one; it may create a crisis), but the more urgent and the more serious threat against our Republic today and against our New Society, is that of our slipping back into the mire of factionalism and selfish individual privilege. There are some who believe that once the efficacious powers of martial law are exercised and applied on the violent threat to the state, then, once again, they are free to make use of the improved situa\u00adtion to pursue the fruits of special privilege that they once knew.\r\nThis, to me, is a grave threat.\r\nWhere before we were a nation divided into disparate and mutually irrecon\u00adcilable groups, today we seem to have divided into three factions, each one distinct from the other.\r\nThe first, which is in the majority, consists of those who feel whole\u00adheartedly involved in the effort to make our New Society a lasting and viable reality. They are those who have placed all their hopes, their dreams, their lives, their property, their honor in the New Society. To this group belongs most of the barangays.\r\nThe second is a combination of elements which question the right of the people to benefit from any kind of change without having paid the price of blood. They are the subversives of the Left, the conspirators of the Right, the parroters of foreign ideologies, the secessionists in our midst. And they have to be contained.\r\nThe third, though small in number like the second, has a role to play in the development effort, but does not have the zeal, the patriotism, and the sincerity to build a strong, prosperous, and disciplined egalitarian republic. While martial law assures the safety of their properties, if not their lives, they see more profit for themselves in the restoration of organized corruption, privilege, and in the social clash of selfishness and of greed. They have not found their place in the democratic revolution, and have chosen to be left out. By dissembling, however, by making it appear that they are in the revolution with us, with the President and with the barangays, they have made our democratic revolution the sanctuary and the refuge for selfish privilege.\r\nThese include, in high or low places as well as in government and private sectors, among the civilians as well as in the military establishment, those who traffic in power and privilege, who pay lip service to our programs yet place themselves and their interests above such reforms, especially where the latter exacts the price of self-abnegation, personal sacrifice, or even inconvenience.\r\nYou and I know who they are. You and I recognize them for what they are. We deal with them, we have seen them. They not only hurt themselves; they hurt us. It pains me to see that there are Filipinos capable of such treason and such treachery, few as they may be.\r\nThey have caused much of the cynicism that has begun to be sown once more in our midst. They are to be feared more than those who seek to bring down the government and replace it with something that would transform our people into ideological robots. I respect an ideological opponent more than the treacherous dissembler who makes it look as if he has joined our ranks and then hits us from behind and in the back. Those who believe in their own ideologies contrary to ours at least enslave in the name of deliverance. But the enemies who lurk behind government desks or move in the corridors of power eat and erode the gains made by the patient toil, the sacrifice, the discipline, and the solemn faith of men and women who have put all their dreams and hopes in our cause.\r\nIf we concede it our duty to attain unity of purpose and of will to succeed, then we must now rid our ranks of these unreformed men. Let all kinship and friendship in the democratic revolution now receive guidance from the philosophy and purpose of our revolution. Those who continue against the moral substance of our reforms must now answer to our people. And thus, I have chosen this forum for you, who represent the people more than any other body. Let them answer to you then, to you the people\u2019s assemblies, the barangays. Let them answer to you, or face the avenging angel of the people\u2019s wrath through their government.\r\nI have come to you today to make this pledge, as the instrument of the people\u2019s will, and as one who governed and exercised the powers of President only by virtue of the decision of the people. And I will exercise those powers only as long as the people so dictate, and no longer. As the instrument of the people\u2019s will, I hereby solemnly pledge that I shall dedicate myself in the next 12 months to the removal from government of men and women who have misused their offices.\r\nLet all men take heed. Friendship, relationship, previous achievement will not constitute any immunity towards the just and proper punishment of those who undermine the democratic revolution.\r\nIn this, I am confident of your support.\r\nOnly by putting this distortion out of the way can our nation proceed to accomplish greater tasks. There will be no witch-hunting. There will be no red-baiting. We will not engage in rumor-mongering. We will be fair. We will be just, and that is why I thought of calling a Pulong ng mga Barangay.\r\nLet us trace our history. We are a country by the will of God and yet we are separated by a small stream of water from the mainland of China, from Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand to the west, Indonesia to the south. It is said that our nation is only 76 years old. That is not correct. Our nation is much older than this. It antedates the Spaniards. It goes beyond the white man\u2019s efforts to explore this part of the world. It antedates even the great Asian migrations to our islands, goes across the centuries into contact with the great civilizations\u2014China, India, and Indonesia.\r\nWe have often looked at these facts and have often thought as if they had come to pass by luck or by chance. But geography tells us otherwise. We are an archipelago on the oceanic margins of Southeast Asia, and this unique position makes us part not only of Asia, but of the great Pacific, which serves as a corridor to the other continents. It is not an accident of history that there should have come upon this archipelago a confluence of cultures, of the Orient and of the Occident, that did not diminish but increased as the world was made smaller by the miracles of travel and of communication.\r\nThere are few islands, tossed as we are in the middle of vast oceans, which are as fortunate as we are. We were to become in time a single political community. We became one nation. God must have meant this to be. Long before some of the peoples of the continental land masses of Asia ever thought of waging sovereignty claims maintaining nationhood, we already bore the flag of nationalism and self-government. Long before some of the peoples of Asia marched to the cry of liberation and independence, we had already made our sacrifice. Revolution broke out in our islands long before it caught the imagination of our Asian brothers.\r\nWe sought to establish a Republic for we had a revolution. But unlike the French and the American Revolution, this did not reach what one historian has described as \u201cits appointed term.\u201d We proclaimed the Philippine Republic only to lose it to a new colonial power.\r\nTime and again, we have asked ourselves, but why, after so much valor and sacrifice, after the death of the flower of our nationhood, why did we fall short of our goal? Why did our revolutions fail? Why? Why, after having charted the course and the framework of a Republic, our fathers should yield yet to another night of colonial rule?\r\nThe answers to these questions seem lost now to the makers of our history. But it behooves us of our generation, yours and mine, and the younger genera\u00adtions that will follow, to find out what happened to our race. Why did we fail in times past? There seems no doubt that between the welding of a nation, the binding together of all the elements constituting the nation, and fighting a superior outside power that opposed that nationhood, the revolution was bound to falter.\r\nBut more than this, we must add a measure of betrayal of the revolution. The revolution of 1896, for instance, was betrayed by our people. This is the instability that seems inbred in the Filipino, the inability of our people to unite at the time of gravest need. In many, the seed of colonialism had been sown, and this seed would never be extirpated from their soul and from their body. Many found in this seed a drive for gain and it mattered little if it was not shared by the homeland. And this is a theme, this theme of discordance, of disunity, of factionalism, of rivalry, of selfish ambition\u2014this is the theme that would haunt us for all time, all these 76 years.\r\nEvery time the nation was confronted by anything less than total extinction by war, the nation was divided. Yes, there was some kind of unity. Hindi ba ninyo naalala noong World War II. Nagkaisa tayong lahat laban sa Hapon. Hinarap natin ang mga pumasok sa ating bansa. But, even in the middle of the fighting, do you remember the experience of the underground? Do you re\u00admember the experience of the guerrilla leaders? How many guerrilla leaders were fighting one another instead of fighting the common enemy, the Japanese? How many? You ask yourselves. You and I were participants in this drama.\r\nDisunity was the theme that kept repeating itself, throughout our history, and it shall continue to be repeated in our history as a nation unless today, you and I, now fully resolve that we shall root out the causes of factionalism and disunity in our country and unite as a people to establish a true and effective Republic.\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1896 we matriculated in the American school of self-government. For 26 years, we bought the idea, borne home to us by the new master, that for our people to rule themselves we must first learn how to govern. Many of us will continue to marvel at the irony, of course, that a people who had brought to world consciousness the historic right of revolution of a colonized people, now presided over the subjugation of another.\r\nThe Philippine Revolution went underground, for that revolution which failed in 1896 lived in some hearts. It lived in the hearts of the people who participated and their children to whom they imparted the knowledge of revolution.\r\nI still remember when I was young, my grandfather used to take me on his knee and tell me of the battles of the Revolution. How Luna was killed in Cabanatuan and how he helped picked him up. And the mountain camps that they established in the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera, where it was best to stay away from the malaria-infested regions. These were traditions that were carried over to my generation. Many of us remember this. The Philippine Revolution, however, went underground. It was left only in me memory of those who were fascinated by the efforts of our people to be free and to establish their own government and their own kind of society.\r\nIn time, the desire for independence would revive but it would revive in more peaceful manifestations, like petitions to the American colonial government; it was never again to issue in a collective and violent struggle. Instead, we negotiated our way to independence.\r\nIn 1935, the terms of transition from colonial status to self-rule were estab\u00adlished. The Commonwealth government under the leadership of Filipinos was inaugurated; we began to tinker with the mechanism of running our own affairs. The air was rife with dreams about to be fulfilled. But even then, if you will remember, even then, there was to be noted the seed of internal struggle in the new nation about to emerge. Colonialism had implanted a system of privilege and power that inevitably divided the people into classes: ruler and ruled, rich and poor, strong and weak. The various administrators, among them President Quezon, seemed to realize this and they sought to implement a program which has been called social justice. But unfortunately, all the efforts fell very much short of the objective.\r\nThe opportunity was there for the country to commence on the road to real democracy. But events and circumstances conspired against it. Hungry for independence and self-rule in whatever form it may have been bequeathed to us, whether negotiated or exacted by heroism in combat, we did not aspire further. We looked only at the face of colonialism and did not bother to inquire about the fundamental issues of social life that would inevitably come with independence.\r\nFor we were in the period when we believed that political emancipation was the answer to all the problems of nationhood. Now, we are aware that political emancipation is merely the beginning of nationhood.\r\nAnd then war broke out in Europe and finally in the Pacific, and it was our fate to be drawn into that war. While in other parts of colonial Southeast Asia, Japanese militarism drove a wedge into the footholds of colonial empire and therefore encouraged nationalist collaboration with it, the Philippine response was fatefully different. With independence arranged for us by 1946, our people fought not the entrenched occupant who had promised independence in 1946 but the new invader, the Japanese.\r\nWhatever her imperialist ambitions in Southeast Asia, however, Japan heralded the liquidation of colonialism in the region. Japan was opposed by us and yet, ironically, Japan caused the liquidation of colonial empires in South\u00adeast Asia. And the world emerged from this war completely different and with a completely different vision of the world to come\u2014new leaderships, new visions, new dreams, new aspirations, new countries, and new people. For us who envisioned independence as an orderly, quiet, and phased deliverance, the war left behind a painful awareness that the business of becoming a strong and progressive nation is affected by the policies and behavior of other nations.\r\nThen, we discovered the lesson that our fathers should have taught us after the revolution of 1896. And this lesson is it is easy to fight a war. It is easy to fight a revolution. It is even easy to win it, but it is hard to run a government. It is harder. It requires more courage to run a government with a determined and resolute objective, to maintain the dignity and independence of individuals and of a nation than to fight a war, to fight in Bataan, in Corregidor, in the battle\u00adfields, in the mountains. These our forebears had learned in 1896. Un\u00adfortunately, there was no one left to articulate to the succeeding generations that this was so. We had to learn it ourselves. We are learning it now.\r\nFor war had left devastation, confusion in our midst. And freedom brought many burdens in its train. It was not the setting that was to prove kind to the experiment with Western democracy in our land, we know that now. Where the framework called for slow and orderly transition from the old to the new, from underdevelopment to development, the postwar problems were of a scale and magnitude that required sweeping, radical measures.\r\nThe history of our country since 1946, therefore, tells us that such an orderly course would never take place. We grew, in the interval, from our innocent belief in the system to the recognition that no form of economic development could take root in our country, unless premised on the broader scale of social transformation. We tried to adopt to the system and launched one development program after another, and the sum of all of these was a legacy of instability, of cares, and escalating problems.\r\nWe refused to accept defeat, for you and I are obstinate people. It took many years for the government to perceive the defeat of the system, and it was under\u00adstandable because there sat in the high and powerful places of government the members of the oligarchy who alone profited from conditions prevailing in the country. Neither the determination of the United States to make democracy succeed in our country, nor the peaceful electoral transfer of power from one national leader to another, availed. Worse, the failure only multiplied the problems, and by 1970, we faced a real crisis of survival. Growth was to be won through an inevitable convulsion of the national soul.\r\nThe convulsion began with the steady decay of social life. I need not go further. Into this situation came the open assaults upon the government. In a strange meeting of minds, the Left and the Right, two otherwise clashing groups joined forces to sow anarchy, eliminate the President, dissolve the Republic of the Philippines, and in its stead sought to establish what they believed was going to be a strong government. They did not perceive the sentiments of our people.\r\nThere was only one choice that remained and that was martial law, unfortunate term that it is, martial law connoting oppression, injustice, dictatorship, and the rule of one man without the authorization of the people. But notwithstanding the fact that even then, before the proclamation of martial law, we know, you and I knew, that the entire culture of the West would rise up in criticism, in denunciation, nay in harassment of our efforts and experiment; knowing full well but bound to the terminology of the Constitution, a Constitu\u00adtion that we did not write, but a Constitution that was borrowed, lifted verbatim from Western minds and Western intellects; knowing this and realizing perhaps the lack of verbal felicity of those who had written the term martial law; knowing that we would be pilloried and crucified for proclaiming martial law; realizing that this was the price that we had to pay in order to save the Republic and save the people, we proclaimed martial law.\r\nNow, let me go into the problems and the strategy for survival. The barangay is the ultimate or the smallest political unit in the country today. There are 33,000 of them in the rural areas, about 8,000 in the urban areas. However, there is confusion. Under the new Constitution, the smallest geographical unit is called the barrio. So, we have the barrio captain, barrio council, barrio assembly. What is the difference between the barrio and the barangay therefore? This confusion has resulted in many requests for clarifica\u00adtion coming to me. And these requests, my friends, have caused us therefore to move into this area which I now call the clarification of the status of the barangay, and today I have decided to issue these decrees.\r\nThe barangay as a political unit is the organ through which the popular will is expressed. In the words of Presidential Decree No. 86-A, issued in January of 1973, it is \u201c[t]he vehicle for expressing the views of the people on important national issues.\u201d The barangays are therefore more representative than a national legislature or the National Assembly, and they are more expressive of the popular will.\r\nHowever, there has been confusion by virtue of the use of the term barrio in the Constitution, resulting in some instances in two sets of local leaders with conflicting jurisdictions. Because of this, therefore, I hereby sign this decree, declaring that all barrios in the Philippines henceforth shall be known as barangays.\r\nAny provision of existing laws to the contrary notwithstanding, all existing barrio or barrios that may hereafter be created are hereby declared as barangays and all references to barrios in any existing laws shall henceforth be understood as references to barangays, without in any manner amending the terminology of the Constitution.\r\nBut in the case of the City of Manila and other chartered cities where there are no barrios, all existing barangays therein, created under Presidential Decree No. 86 as amended, shall continue as such barangays now.\r\nRepublic Act No. 3590 as amended, otherwise known as the Revised Barrio Charter, is hereby adopted as the Barangay Charter. All powers, rights vested in or exercised by the Barrio Assembly, the Barrio Council, and all barrio officials pursuant to Republic Act No. 3590, and such other powers, rights pertaining to or conferred upon them by other laws before or after this decree shall henceforth be exercised by the Barangay Assembly. Barangay Council, and barangay officials. The officials of the barrio as constituted pursuant to Republic Act 3590 shall now be known as barangay captain, barangay council\u00adman, barangay secretary, and barangay treasurer.\r\nNow to resolve the possible conflict of authority between some barangays and some barrios. I hereby also sign a decree that in cases where there are any conflicts arising out of the creation of barangays, or barrios, should there be any conflict in the jurisdiction or the exercise of powers of the barangay captain, council, or assembly, such a conflict shall be decided by the holding of an election to be determined by the secretary of local government upon the approval of the President. This is only when there is a conflict of leadership between the barangay and the barrio.\r\nI therefore sign the conversion of all the barrios into barangays.\r\nBut that is not all. The provinces, the municipalities, and the cities receive a share in the internal revenue collections of the national government. But in the past, the barangays or the barrios never received any definite share. In accordance with the studies made by the experts and without in any manner affecting the share of the province, I have organized a plan for setting aside a definite amount of money for the barangays. I have asked the Department of Finance, therefore, to implement a decree I have prepared to amend Sec. 2 of Presidential Decree No. 144, which provides for the sharing of the internal revenue collection, to read as follows: \u201cThis allotment shall be distributed as follows: 30 per centum to provinces; 45 per centum to municipalities; 25 per centum to cities, and irrespective of the amount of collection, a total for the first two years of 65 million pesos annually shall be distributed and allotted to barangays.\u201d\r\nStarting 1976 to 1977, however, the following allocations shall be made; 25 per centum to provinces, 40 per centum to municipalities, 25 percent to cities, and 10 percent to barangays, definitely.\r\nWe are also going to create a Barangay Development Fund. There is hereby created a Barangay Development Fund to be constituted of the annual con\u00adtributions of not exceeding P500 per barangay from each province, city, and municipality, which funds shall be spent solely for community development projects. These funds shall be maintained in the special books of accounts.\r\nNow, what does this actually mean? This actually means that the barangays now have their own sources of funds, but that is not all. From now on, beginning today, the barangays will also have a definite allocation from the special highway fund. Before today, the barangays or the barrios never had any share, any definite share, in the special highway fund.\r\nTherefore, without in any manner changing the allocations, I hereby sign this decree amending Sec. 3 of Presidential Decree No. 436, providing that before the allocations to provinces, municipalities, and chartered cities is made, one-fourth of the total accruals under this section shall be set aside and apportioned annually by the President among barangays for the construction, improvement, and maintenance of roads and bridges within their respective territorial jurisdiction in accordance with a program to be prepared. As estimated by the Secretary of Public Highways, this one-fourth is about P42.5 million to be distributed to all the barangays in the Philippines for highways and bridges.\r\nUnder these two decrees, therefore, the barangays will receive a total of about P107,000,000 annually. I therefore sign this decree on the allocation of the special highway fund.\r\nAt the same time, however, we have a proposal, the proposed Local Government Code. This code is supposed to be under study in the Office of the President. I am now reviewing the provisions of this code. But because this code affects the local government, through you, I hereby endorse this code for study by all the barangays in the Philippines, all provinces, all cities, and all municipalities. I hereby transfer to this code for the study by the barangays throughout the Philippines.\r\nNow, I have strengthened the position of the barangays. It is necessary, however, that with power and authority, with finances must go responsibility. The barangay not only is the vehicle for expressing the views of the people, it is also the instrument for greater production. Whether we face recession or worse and graver threats arising out of the world situation, food production is still the principal program of government. Whatever may happen, provided we have enough food, the Philippines will not only survive, we will progress. The principal vehicle for production must be the barangays and the Samahang Nayon. And this is where you must come in.\r\nThe record of our importations of food and rice is quite clear. How much did we import in food products from 1967 to the present? Let me read them to you: 1967, $100,206,000; 1968, $132,712,000; 1969, $124,504,000; 1970, $103,539,000; 1971, $145,815,000; 1972, $174,963,000; 1973, $202,073,000; 1974, $175,917,000.\r\nHow about rice? We imported in 1971, P265,726,000 worth of rice; in 1972, P345,852,000; in 1973, P600,716,000, and in 1974, P345,852,000.\r\nWe face therefore this reality: Our efforts have not wiped out the deficits in our food requirements. We have been spending hard-earned dollars for food which can be produced here in our country. There is no reason on earth why, notwithstanding the floods, notwithstanding the typhoons, notwithstanding the natural calamities, the Philippines cannot produce the food that it requires.\r\nWe must now dedicate ourselves to the solemn task. And for this purpose, we need every hand. We need total concentration and immediate action. We need the barangays. And this is the reason for the strengthening of the barangays today. There are, I repeat, 33,956 barangays all over the country which coincide with the legally created barrios under the revised barrio charter. In addition, there are more than 8,000 barangays in districts or wards of chartered cities, the so-called urban barangays. We have not only increased the income of the barangays; we have given the leaders as well as the members thereof a greater leeway of authority.\r\nInasmuch as three-fourths of our people live in the rural areas and draw sustenance from agriculture, we shall now, as a matter of the highest priority, endeavor to realize our full potential in agriculture, principally food produc\u00adtion.\r\nWe shall mobilize by so doing a tremendous force against stagnation and that terrible malaise which descends upon the people endangered by a turbulent economy. Did you know that 62.5 percent of our people are below the age of 25? We are a young country. There is no reason therefore why the great majority of our people cannot be devoted to productive enterprise. And yet, only a part of the entire population is engaged in production. This is one of the basic deficiencies of our country and our economy today. The barangay and the corresponding Samahang Nayon are the answers. Of course, we must adopt a youth development program. And today, I am also going to create a new department in government, the Department of Youth and Sports Development. I am going to sign this in your presence.\r\nAn unfailing indicator, or symptom, of a country\u2019s deterioration is a mass of aimless dazed or dissipated young people. We are aware of our experience in the recent past. Our youth development program, therefore, should instill in our young citizens the values of respect and discipline. And we must engage their minds in work that will produce benefits for themselves.\r\nAnd that is why we have this balanced economic policy. We support industry, but more than this, we must support agriculture. As you know, in industry, we have been advised that most countries are moving timidly in setting up new enterprises and expanding the economy. In our case, we have made a different choice. We are moving boldly. We have anticipated these problems. We borrowed money last January. We borrowed about $700,000,000 and about $400,000,000 of acceptances. We must look towards a bold pursuit of our national development.\r\nI hereby announce today that we will not in any way reduce our efforts at infrastructure development, but we will change the priority. Infrastructure will be devoted principally to production. We must look towards a bold pursuit of our national development program as the permanent solution of our problems. This means a high level of productivity and its equitable sharing among individuals and communities.\r\nSo, we must expand agriculture and industry. Our yearly capital require\u00adments are anywhere from 400 to 500 million dollars. We have four sources of capital: foreign exchange earnings; external sources in the form of foreign loans and foreign investments; domestic investment; and national savings. These components of the capital structure of the economy all registered decisive increases during the last two years. Because of the international pressures on our economy, there is need to restudy all of these. Adjustments must be made in capital development.\r\nFirst, substantial increases in petroleum products and capital equipment have reversed the favorable trade balance and severely strained the foreign exchange earnings of the country. At the end of the year, we will have a deficit in our trade. There will be an estimated $38 million deficit. We are fortunate, however, that the high level of our international reserves\u2014$1.5 billion\u2014cushions the impact of this blow and allows us time to cope with this difficulty. In the coming year, we must enlarge our efforts to increase our export earnings.\r\nSecond, the country\u2019s capacity today to service external debt has reached new limits. Our policy, therefore, is this: We shall avail ourselves of foreign loans only if they are within the capacity of our economy to service them in an orderly and consistent manner. Government borrowings at this time must stand still. Instead, we have augmented guarantee facilities for long-term borrowings or deferred-payment imports of the private sector. This has been done through the establishment of the Philippine Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation, with an initial capital of P1 billion. This corporation will be an effective conduit of foreign capital for national development.\r\nThird, the unprecedented volume of foreign investments that has entered the economy will be further stimulated by new incentives. Policies on sharing, repatriation of capital, and tax exemptions shall be supplemented with vigorous measures on an industry-to-industry basis. We shall expand the areas in which foreign investments can take part to include more export-oriented projects. Portfolio investors will be encouraged through the transformation of more companies into truly public corporations that will ensure easy cash conversion of investments.\r\nFourth, we must intensify the campaign to increase national savings and domestic investments.\r\nOf course, our basic approach has always been the promotion of export-oriented industries. We will continue with this program.\r\nThere are many other policies which I need not go into. I can only add further that there will be acceleration of the growth of our external trade by moving into products that will find a market even in a receding world economy.\r\nThere will be an integrated export promotions program abroad and efficient surveys of foreign markets; the rationalization of transport movements; the utilization of Eastern European ships and nonconference liners in trade transport.\r\nNow, we go back to agriculture. Two-thirds of our exports are agricultural products. We must now continue the development of commercial farm produce to a level even higher than what we attained before.\r\nWe are now going to move into processing these agricultural products: copra, wood, and the like. We have moved on agrarian reform, and I need not go into this I will make a more detailed presentation of agrarian reforms when we inaugurate the proclamation of land reform sometime in the later part of this month.\r\nBut now, I would like to move into what I consider one of the most important pillars of agricultural development, which is the Cooperatives Development Program. Our agrarian reform program, to be faithful to our hopes, and to liberate our farmers from bondage rather than imprison them in failed expectations, must now move swiftly in rural areas. We must now replace the old institutions with new ones. The old system of ties based on paternalism must now slowly give way to broader fraternalism, in keeping with the spirit of our changing rural society. We must now provide new institutional mechanisms to make community action come to life.\r\nI noticed that there was difficulty in the organization of cooperatives, not only because of some misunderstanding, in the national level offices, of the purpose of cooperatives, of their venue, of their jurisdiction and their capabilities, but also because of the timidity of the barrio and barangay leaders.\r\nI have taken this opportunity to tell you that in addition to the authority that I have vested in the barangay today by virtue of the decrees that I have signed, I place on your shoulders, therefore, this responsibility, this burden corresponding with the authority that has just been granted to you. And that is the movement of the Cooperative Development Program forward at an accelerated pace.\r\nAs you very well know, we are trying to broaden the economic base of our country. Before, we had the landlords. We broke the system up. We broke up the vast landed estates. And at the same time, however, those landowners were given the means by which to go into the industry. Now, what will happen? They will use their management talent to move into more profitable enterprises, more profitable than agriculture.\r\nWe might end up with an economy where again the same group of oligarchs controlling the more profitable portion of our economy, which is industries, trade, commerce, banking, and the like.\r\nPapasok ang mga mayayaman sa mga bangko, industriya, pagawaan. Eh diyan ang malaking kita, marahil magiging malaki ang kita niyan, mas malaki pa kaysa sa pagsasaka. Kung ang ating balak ay ang kayamanan ay dapat lumaganap sa karamihan ng ating mga mamamayan, pagkakamali kung hindi natin bibigyan ang ating mga mamamayan ng pagkakataong tulad ng tinatamasa ng mayayaman. To prevent this crisis that may come, it becomes necessary to accelerate the efforts of broadening the base of the wealth and of economic opportunity.\r\nWe have as of today, a total of 10,419 Samahang Nayons, in 15,729 barrios throughout the country. These have a total membership of 559,054 and an accumulated capital of P5.6 million derived mostly from membership fees. The Samahang Nayon is the first phase in the movement towards the building of cooperatives. After this, the Kilusang Bayan comes next. We have now entered this phase. We must now enter this phase, and I am asking you, the barangays and the barangay leaders who I have just vested with authority, with power and with funds to participate in the effort at moving from this phase of Samahang Nayon into the phase of Kilusang Bayan.\r\nThrough the Samahang Nayon, we have broken ground for the emancipa\u00adtion of the rural worker from feudal inequities. As the barangay vests in him political power, the Samahang Nayon now vests in him economic power. Under the roof of the Samahang Nayon, the farmer is able to locate himself permanently in a system that provides organized credit assistance that assures him of seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs, as well as marketing assistance that assures him of better prices for his produce. Through the Samahang Nayon, the individual capabilities of the small farmers and workers are pooled together so that they can provide for the future of their families through cheap insurance, banking, and other schemes that may be capitalized from a share of the fruits of their labors. Through the mechanism of the area marketing cooperatives of the Samahang Nayon which have been organized in at least 10 provinces, we hope to see the farmer get more for his farm produce while at the same time cutting down the cost to the consumer. Did you know that the farm products that come from you in the farms increase in price by 250 percent when they are sold to the consumer? Example, cabbage, when it is sold to the laborer in Tondo, is sold at P1.21 per kilogram. But the farmer gets only P0.44 for it in his farm in Baguio. Ang magsasaka, apatnapu\u2019t apat na pera lamang ang ibinabayad sa kanya nguni\u2019t pagdating sa mga manggagawa at ipinagbibili sa manggagawa, isang piso at dalawampu\u2019t isang pera ang bayad. Eh sino ang kumita? Sino ang mas malaking kita, iyong magsasaka, o iyong tindera, o iyong trader, middleman? Sinong kumita ng malaking pera? Ang middleman, hindi ang magsasaka. We can no longer tolerate this. We can no longer tolerate the middleman getting more money than the one who works to produce the product, the farmer. It is therefore necessary that we now accelerate the implementation of the program and we create the machinery through which the farmer, let\u2019s say, who sells his cabbage will get not 44 but perhaps 60 centavos while the consumer will pay not P1.21 but P0.80. Through this, we hope to effectively cut down the inter\u00advention of middlemen. So, we must move into the next stage and that is the Kilusang Bayan.\r\nThe Samahang Nayon today must now evolve into full corporate entities attaining economies of size with one corporate plan, one management, one source of funding, where the members will not individually have to worry about their fertilizers and seeds and other inputs of production, or the marketing of their individual products, and where all these will naturally flow from tie-ups between producers, cooperatives, and consumer cooperatives and the National Food Terminal Market. And this is your responsibility.\r\nWe will give incentives to the barangays that will help in the organization of the Kilusang Bayan and the Samahang Nayon. Sa ngayon, ano ang nangyayari sa Samahang Nayon? Tinatawag nga nating Samahang Nayon iyan, pero mayroon bang tunay na samahan? Sa Samahang Nayon, dapat ang mga kasapi niyan ay dapat magtulungan at kumilos parang iisang tao. Ano ang nangyayari ngayon? Samahang Nayon ka nga, miyembro ka nga, ikaw rin ang mamimili kung ano ang inyong binhi kung saan ka bibili ng abono o pataba, saan ka bibili ng pesticide, kung kukulangin ka ng tubig, wala naman tutulong sa iyo, sapagka\u2019t hindi pa nahihirati ang ating mga magsasaka sa pagtutulungan ng husto. This is what I am trying to drive at. There is no single management and no corporate spirit in the Samahang Nayon. We must now move into this phase. The phase of the Kilusang Bayan, and I place this responsibility on the barangay leaders of the Philippines.\r\nAlam naman ninyo, rural credit, sinasabi nating parati, rural credit, national government, Philippine National Bank, ACA, at saka rural banks, nagpapautang sa ating mga magsasaka. But if we could create cooperative banking it would be all for the better.\r\nRural credit is for the farmer. If the farmer is willing to finance himself through cooperative banking; therefore, we must allow the farmer to organize cooperative banks for himself. This is a policy.\r\nI hereby announce therefore, and let all the monetary authorities be on notice, that it is the policy of the national government, of our Republic, to encourage the organization of cooperative banks by Samahang Nayon or Kilusang Bayan or the farmers themselves in order that they may finance their own activities in the agricultural areas of our country.\r\nI therefore ask all national offices to do away with red tape and bureau\u00adcratic obstacles in order that we can attain this objective of banding the farmers together into a corporate unity and a corporate personality which the farmer will be able to help himself.\r\nI understand that there are new efforts to organize, for instance, a cooperative bank in Nueva Ecija with a capitalization of P500,000, and that three more are coming up in Pangasinan, Isabela, Bukidnon. I would like to commend these members of the cooperatives in Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Isabela, and Bukidnon. I will expect action on all of these efforts as soon as possible.\r\nNow, my friends, one last point. I missed one decree here. It should have been signed with the rest and I\u2019m asking you to participate in the implementa\u00adtion of this decree, especially most of the barangay leaders here who are from the urban areas. I refer to the new decree on drug addiction.\r\nDrug addiction is no longer just a threat. It has become a morbid and per\u00adplexing reality. There are at least 60,000 drug addicts throughout the Philippines today. In a sense, drugs pose a greater danger than crime itself. Addiction works insidiously to destroy private lives, and ultimately the life of the nation. The youth, many of them in the schools, are particularly vulnerable to it. I have received a file of reports on drug addiction and I am alarmed. Antinarcotics squads have a full-time job tracking down the monster to its many lairs. In the past years they have turned up sizable caches of marijuana, opium, heroin, and other habit-forming drugs. The most alarming fact is that the drug traffic has become an underground or rebel activity, and it has gone deeper since proclama\u00adtion of martial law. I mean gone more secretive because of the increased effi\u00adciency demonstrated by our law enforcement agencies like the NBI, the CANU, the constabulary, and the police.\r\nThe campaign against drug addiction will now be waged more relentlessly. We have already provided for stiffer penalties for violation of our antinarcotic laws. To give the drive central planning and greater coordination, I hereby announce therefore today that the barangay leaders will be asked to participate in the drive against drug addiction. I shall ask you, the barangay leaders, to help ferret out not only the drug pushers but the drug addicts, not for punishment, but for rehabilitation. Today, I shall sign a decree creating the Commission on Narcotics, a commission that shall now utilize or coordinate all the efforts of all the agencies in government including the barangay leaders to fight drug addiction.\r\nThe barangay leaders are authorized to arrest those who are engaged in selling drugs as well as using drugs. You are under mandate to report to the police and to the NBI all those who are engaged in drug addiction because there is no one who is in a better position to know what is happening in the neighbor\u00adhood than the barangay leader. I therefore ask you to join wholeheartedly and sincerely in this effort against drug addiction in our country today.\r\nI want the barangay leaders to hear this from me directly: I will hold you responsible if you don\u2019t help in the campaign against drug addiction. This is too serious. You know, it\u2019s something that I must participate in now. It is necessary that the President himself now intervene in this because we have definite information that the rebels and subversives who are fighting the government are actually utilizing drug addiction for their purposes. Drug addiction has become a matter of state security.\r\nWith your help, we won\u2019t need to worry too much about peace and order. You know what is happening everywhere. We have still the threat in Mindanao and Sulu but we are in control. \u00a0Yes, there are ambuscades, you all know what is happening there, and you have the barangays. We may hear all kinds of rumors to the effect that the secessionists there are in control of everything. You know that is not true. If they were in control, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I would be there, fighting against them. I would be staying in the field. You remember when in 1973, there was a sudden upsurge of fighting in the South; I had to go there to see if the Muslims and Christians were organized to protect themselves. We are going to try and work out some kind of a solution, a peaceful solution to all of this and I think that we are going to succeed. I cannot reveal to you now the de\u00adtails of the efforts but we are moving towards a successful conciliation of all elements and it\u2019s my hope that with the help of the Almighty, we will stop this fighting in the South.\r\nOf course, subversion is like malaria. When your body is weak, it attacks the entire constitution. If we are weakened\u2014economically, politically, socially\u2014subversion will rise. This is the history of subversion in our country. We all realize therefore that since the foundation of our society is a civil order which allows every man to move about peacefully to attain his lawful objectives with\u00adout prejudicing his fellowmen, inasmuch as this is the foundation not only of our society but of our reforms and programs of development we must guard it vigilantly, and in this effort your organization is essential.\r\nI ask you to join in all these efforts because security is related to the efforts against drug addiction and the organization of cooperatives, Samahang Nayon, and Kilusang Bayan.\r\nWhat has the cooperative and the Kilusang Bayan or the Samahang Nayon got to do with security? Security doesn\u2019t merely mean military security. Today military security is interchangeable with economic stability; if there is scarcity in food, if prices go up and get out of control beyond the means of the common man, then you will have military insecurity as well as economic instability. Therefore, they are faces of the same coin. And when I exhort you, therefore, to produce more food, I think not only of economic progress\u2014I think of stability. I think of the security of our state and of our Republic. I think of the protection and the health of our people, of our children, and those who shall follow them.\r\nAnd so, today, as you will note, we have opened a new front, the diplomatic front. We have opened the diplomatic front with respect to the Middle East countries, the source of our oil.\r\nNasabi ko nga kanina, nag-iisa ako rito sa Malaca\u00f1ang sapagkat umalis ang ating Unang Ginang. Gaano man ang pangungulila ko, kailangang umalis siya sapagka\u2019t kinakailangan tanggapin ang anyaya sa kanya ni Premier Chou En-Lai. Sa aking palagay, ang lakad ng ating Unang Ginang na ito ay magbubunga ng kasaganaan ng ating bansa.\r\nI am certain that normalization of relations with all the socialist countries of the world will increase trade and improve our military security. I cannot explain to you the details of all the problems pertaining to this now and especially on the trip of the First Lady. But later, you will learn from me and from all other sources the result of this trip.\r\nIt is also our hope that we shall be able to finalize the negotiations with the United States. We are negotiating a trade agreement to replace the Laurel-Langley Agreement. This matter involves the military bases and involves the policies of our country. But rest assured that when your President negotiates on these treaties, he negotiates with the barangays behind him. He negotiates with your strength. He negotiates with your patriotism. He negotiates with your dignity as individuals and as a nation. He negotiates with your pledge that you offer not only your properties and your life but your sacred honor like the patriots of old in the support and protection of our country. Rest assured, therefore, that as I exhort you to do all these, so too will your President, so too will your political leadership in the country. You and I are bound to this common resolution, that our country will never wane and there will be only one guide and that is the welfare of the Filipino people and the national interest.\r\nI therefore close with this statement. There is no fear of any economic crisis. There is no fear of any recession, provided we are dedicated. There is no fear of any external foe, of any rebel, of any secessionist, provided we are united. Provided we don\u2019t fall into the old error of our race, into factionalism, into personal ambition and personal interest raised above the national interest; provided we do not again repeat the failure and the errors of the past; provided we act as a nation, as a Filipino people, no danger, no threat can weaken the Republic of the Philippines. And I trust that since the barangay has been strengthened as the basis and the foundation of our society, we will stand erect and strong, strong as the molave, upright even against the most severe storm and typhoon that may come from any part of the world.", "title": "The Barangay and the Imperative of National Unity"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on June 12, 1978]\r\n\r\nSa bisa ng aking sinumpaang katungkulan bilang Punong Ministro at gayon din sa panunumpa sa katungkulan ng ating Gabinete, pasisimulan natin ngayon ang pamunuan, paglilingkod at pagtatatag ng isang bagong pamahalaan sa Republika ng Pilipinas.\r\nMakahulugan na isinasagawa natin ang lahat ng mga ito sa dakilang araw ng pagdiriwang natin ng ika-80 kaarawan ng ating kasarinlan.\r\nBatid ng lahat ng ating mga mamamayan kung gaano kahalaga ang araw na ito sa ating pagkalahi at pagkabansa.\r\nWith the oath I have just taken as Prime Minister, and the oath taken by the members of the Cabinet, a new government enters into the service of our Re\u00adpublic.\r\nIt adds to the awesome charge of this assembly that it should open its first session on this 80th year of our independence.\r\nNone of us can fail to appreciate the real significance of this moment.\r\nNone cannot but glory at the significance, political and otherwise, of the events not only today but in the last five-and-a-half years. For the first time the Filipino people are truly sovereign over their land. After almost 500 years, for the first time in our history, no foreign colonizer holds any right of sovereignty over any part of our territory.\r\nBarely a month ago, the American government formally recognized the supremacy of our sovereignty over the military bases.\r\nWe celebrate, therefore, our day of independence with an act of freedom. We have organized the government in accordance with the Constitution, which was formulated and ratified at the instance and with the mandate of our people without the intervention of a foreign power. We adopt a form of government completely derived from all the others that we have known, a mixture of the presidential and parliamentary forms of government.\r\nToday we manifest in formal form our shift from the authoritarian form to liberalism, against the trend of history which claims the irreversibility of the drift towards authoritarianism and centralism.\r\nWe have just overcome, if at a price, foreign-backed secessionist move\u00adment that sought to dismember the territory of the Republic. The problem remains, but the loss of our territory has been denied by our people.\r\nWe have overwhelmed the leftist-rightist rebellion that sought to win political power by force. In the process we have converted the former reactionary and status quo mechanism of martial law into a liberal instrument of reform and laid the foundation for the restructuring of our entire society.\r\nWe have revived our ancient ideals and institutions not merely as inspira\u00adtional reminders of a noble past but as a workable pattern of government and of daily life.\r\nWe have returned pride to the Filipino. We have converted economic and even security crises, chaos, and fratricidal bloodletting into motivating forces for national unity and cohesive community action.\r\nProud of his past, aware of his heritage, the Filipino has turned crisis into opportunity and has willingly rectified past errors to retrieve a lost society from disintegration.\r\nNationalism and self-reliance are once again proudly proclaimed as articles of our faith.\r\nWe have rediscovered and practiced the ancient virtues. As it were, we placated the once angry gods of our fathers without offerings of self-denial.\r\nIn January 1973, a few months after the proclamation of martial law, when our people ratified the new Constitution, the interim National Assembly should have replaced the Congress, which the new Constitution had abolished. But in ratifying the new charter, our people expressly rejected the interim National Assembly, convinced perhaps that it carried the seeds of the old vices.\r\nFor as long as crisis government combined the powers of the executive and the legislature in the Presidency, there were those who felt no pressing need to set up a transitional lawmaking body.\r\nBut it was never the intent of our people, nor my wish, that the consolida\u00adtion of legislative and executive powers in the Presidency should continue indefinitely or result in the disappearance altogether of a legislative assembly. Rather, it was our common faith that as the emergency eased, as the situation of the country stabilized, and as reforms took root in national life, we would set in motion the processes for the orderly transition from presidential law making to legislation by a lawmaking body.\r\nIt was for this reason that in the referendum-plebiscite of October 1976, our people ratified the amendments to the Constitution, establishing the interim Batasang Pambansa in which we now have the honor to participate.\r\nWith that amendment, coupled with the propitious developments that marked the later years of crisis government, we were able in April this year to hold elections for the interim Batasang Pambansa. Thus, you and I are here today.\r\nWhen we reflect upon the difficulties we have had to hurdle to convene this body, we cannot fail to note how grave is our responsibility and how anxious are our people about this transitional parliament.\r\nNot without anxiety did our people choose to have a new legislature in place of the old, whose passing they were not inclined to mourn; and not without anxiety do they now view the work of this assembly as it commences its historic work.\r\nWe have been summoned to great tasks, for which we must now give the very best of ourselves.\r\nThe Constitution (Article XVII, Section 5) directs us \u201cto give priority to measures for the orderly transition from the presidential to the parliamentary system, the reorganization of the government, the eradication of graft and corruption, the effective maintenance of peace and order, the implementation of declared agrarian reforms, the standardization of compensation of govern\u00adment employees, and such other measures as shall bridge the gap between the rich and poor.\u201d\r\nWhile the provision especially conceives of the interim Batasang Pambansa as a bridge from the presidential to the parliamentary system, behind it is the implied meaning that it must also serve as an organ for the institutionalization of reforms, especially agrarian reform, as a vehicle for social, economic, and political change.\r\nFor there can be no separation of the objective to achieve an effective parlia\u00admentary order from that of attaining a truly progressive, dynamic democratic society.\r\nThus, if in the past we have had legislatures that tended to conserve rather than reform, legislatures that preached caution in response to crisis and urgency as well as challenge, legislatures that nursed dependence on others rather than encouraged national self-reliance, and legislatures that competed with the executive branch instead of working as its unfailing partner and ally\u2014and this to the prejudice of the national welfare\u2014this assembly must see itself as a reformist committed to change and the transformation of our society.\r\nThis is an assembly that must embody for us the unity of purpose and effort which enabled us to surmount chaos and crisis in our national life and to mobilize the national will for transformation and development.\r\nAnd this is an assembly, I dare say, which must reflect the nation we are today and light up our path towards the future.\r\nFor this body is itself a child of our New Society, born in the womb of crisis, challenge, and reform which have marked our national life during the last five-and-a-half years.\r\nAnd what we have learned, what we have sown and reaped during this critical and crucial period of ferment constitutes the starting point of the work of this assembly. Indeed, it forms the foundation of this body, without which our lofty goals would be hollow and frail and our efforts mired in the paralysis and chaos that proved the downfall of the old society.\r\nThe crises we have overcome and the struggle we have had to wage are too recent to be forgotten. We cannot and should not forget the dangers that faced the Republic, nor the price we had to pay for our survival and our march to progress. For we were a nation under siege.\r\nIt was under those circumstances that we declared martial law on September 21, 1972, giving rise to what we have since called the crisis government.\r\nUp to now, it is sometimes wondered why our response to crisis had not been limited to a simple struggle against the enemies of the state. The answer is obvious. We knew the crisis to be rooted in social inequities, in conditions of oppression and want, which our democratic processes could only palliate. Behind the arms borne against the state were grievances so deep and glaring that many found common cause with the insurgents and the rebels without under\u00adstanding why. Behind the sudden coalition of antigovernment forces was the loss of will and paralysis on the part of government and government officers, which served to encourage the ambitions of many who coveted power no matter by what means. And beyond the barricades, an entire society asked for not just surcease to the chaos on our streets but earnest effort to rally its flagging energies to the tasks of national transformation and change.\r\nThe cause of national survival itself demanded sweeping social change and reform. And we saw that any measure to quell the insurgency and rebellion would only be a half-measure, a victory half-won, if it did not attack the cause of rebellion itself.\r\nBefore the combined challenge of leftists, rightists, and secessionists, we summoned the full might of the state in a determined effort to stem the tide of national collapse and to stop the wave of violence and terrorism sweeping the countryside. \u00a0It was certainly one of the happier aspects of that unsettled period in our history that when government manifested its resolve to survive, our peo\u00adple stood firmly by its side.\u00a0 And we witnessed none of the distress and chaos which so often marked the proclamation of emergency in other countries.\r\nAnd to the call for change we summoned all that was within the power of the crisis government to muster. In the first month alone of our crisis government, we incorporated into the law of the land vital and radical measures, which since 1946 had wallowed in the agenda of the old Congress.\r\nWe declared the entire country a land reform area and decreed the eman\u00adcipation of the tenant from his bondage to the soil.\r\nSixty-six percent of eligible tenant-farmers have been covered by certifi\u00adcates of land transfer, while land consolidation, compact fanning, cooperative development, and resettlement occupy the first category of priority projects of the government. The program which makes the tenant-farmer not only a free man but a leading participant in the national effort to make the country fully self-reliant remains the cornerstone of the reforms of the New Society and will continue to mobilize the best efforts and substantial resources of the govern\u00adment.\r\nWe decreed the massive reorganization of our government, so sweeping in scope that in barely a month\u2019s time thousands were removed from office and an almost new governmental structure took over the reins of the bureaucracy.\r\nWe formulated a new national development plan and in the process created the National Economic and Development Authority which unified the appara\u00adtus of economic planning under one roof and set the stage for the mobilization of national energies for the tasks of economic development.\r\nIn support of the new plan, we launched a comprehensive food production program and new industrial priorities beamed towards export expansion and regional dispersal of industry. The food production program has since been lauded by other countries.\r\nWe initiated programs for the redistribution and democratization of wealth, beginning with policies designed to extend a new deal to labor and the peasantry and culminating in the passing of a new Labor Code and the implementation of a massive rural development program.\r\nIn the belief that social development and individual welfare cannot be postponed until the time when full economic modernization is attained, we sought the expansion of job opportunities, social amenities, and social services, particularly those covering the basic necessities of food and health.\r\nTo consolidate the gains in peace and order, we effected the full reorganiza\u00adtion of all police agencies under the Integrated National Police.\r\nAnd this was matched by measures to strengthen the administration of justice, including among others the revitalization of the civilian courts. Com\u00adplementing this was a new era of placing such courts directly under the Supreme Court of the Philippines, free finally from politics.\r\nComplementing this was the commencement of a national program for self-reliance in national defense, an objective made imperative by developments in Asia and encouraged by the exemplary performance of our Armed Forces, without which the efforts during the period of emergency might have failed.\r\nIn the field of our relations with other countries, we effected a fundamental recasting of our foreign policy, established relations with all countries regard\u00adless of social system, and for the first time enlisted diplomacy in the service of our development goals.\r\nAnd perhaps most noteworthy of all, \u00a0we committed ourselves to the tasks of returning power to our people, of rebuilding our political life at the grassroots level through the creation of the barangays and the citizen, assemblies or the sanggunian.\r\nIn all of these areas, our actions went beyond the writing of policies to the implementation of programs and the achievement of goals. And the vision of our New Society did not fail to touch the smallest sector of the nation.\r\nTaken together, all these spell a building of national capabilities, a conso\u00adlidation of the national will for our development effort, which in the event injected new dynamism and purpose into our national life.\r\nThere are indelible accomplishments to be seen in the record\u2014the surge of the national economy, the rise in incomes, the perceptible improvement of individual welfare, the new civility in our social life, and the respect we have gained in the family of nations; and over and above all, the feeling of confidence and pride that you now see and feel demonstrated and manifested throughout the land by our people. But what is most compelling about these achievements is the fact that they are gains that have not ceased ad do not cease to grow. They point us irreversibly forward, towards larger goals.\r\nThese gains may be reduced to the following principles:\r\nFirst: The survival of the public order and of the individual rights it secures rests on the ability of the government to maintain its independence from those who would seek to manipulate it, fragment it, or subvert it. Our recent experience has taught us that only when the government was able to liberate itself from the entrenched influence of the oligarchy, the political warlords, and the criminal syndicates could it cope effectively with the open challenge of rebellion and anarchy. A weak government is a menace to public order, to national security and to individual rights.\r\nSecond: Representative government is representative only when the many and the poor are organized to articulate their interests and to participate in government. It has been our experience that political power resides as it did in the political broker of old and not in the people when the farmer is not organized, or the worker is not organized or the barangay is not organized, or major sectors of our society to organize the masses in their communities and in their sectors, we cannot achieve complete participatory democracy.\r\nThird:\u00a0 The struggle for national development, for true and complete free\u00addom and human rights, must be waged and won in the rural areas more than anywhere else. It is in the rural areas where the great majority of our people live and where poverty and under development are most deeply rooted. It is the geography of our central concern and the great redirection of public resources from the urban to the rural area initiated by the crisis government which must be maintained. Unless we do so, the entire nation, including its urban areas, will ultimately be overwhelmed by deprivation.\r\nFourth: The twin problems of poverty and inequality which have long plagued our society have led us finally to concentrate on the basic needs of the poor and on the basic requirements for the expansion of their economic opportunities. From all the years of perilous self-government that we as a nation have experienced, from all the false starts and wrong turns and the distorted decisions and all the misdirected efforts and misspent resources of the past, we have learned painfully and at great cost but we have learned finally and well. I hope to return to the basic tenets and needs and basic concerns of the poor and the underprivileged. And these are the things needed for the body\u2014food, land, job, housing, schools, roads, medical care, electricity, water, and the protec\u00adtion of the law, but over and above all, justice, as well as a belief in one\u2019s history and tradition, the arts, and the protection of our environment and ecology. These are the proud achievements of the crisis government, and I have no doubt these will be the continuing achievements of this assembly, that on every item of this list a major breakthrough has been made and will continue to be made. And it is the great responsibility of this assembly to see to it that these breakthroughs are secured and made the avenues for continued advance.\r\nFifth: The sure sign of our maturity as a nation lies incurability to align the structure of our foreign relations in consonance with our domestic goals and needs. In the readjustment, diversification, and expansion of our foreign relation, in the search for new friends on the basis of new relations, and the establishment of new relations with old friends, we shall find a new source of national security and an added resource for national development.\r\nThese principles of government that I have referred to are not unrelated measures designed to merely conciliate specific grievances in our national life or to serve narrow interests of specific sectors.\u00a0 They form one united whole, a seamless whole, and their application which has permeated the whole of our country and touched every sector of society shall be the role of this assembly\u2014to see to it that all these reforms shall touch the life of every Filipino in our country,\r\nSo it is this coherent, rational program of government that offers the basis for continuity in the process of reform and development during this period of transition towards a mixed presidential-parliamentary form of government.\r\nWe have often wondered how we moved from crisis and adversity to stability and dynamism over the short period of five-and-a-half years, how we met targets well beyond anything we had known in the past.\u00a0 So much so that in the year 1974, at the height of the economic crisis, the rate of growth of our economy reached the unprecedented level of almost 10%. Progress was won through the effective exercise of emergency powers. Yet, from the very beginning, such exercise was conceived to be merely temporary in nature and bounded by periodic consultations with our people.\r\nThe momentum of national recovery and transformation now requires the growing permanency of democratic processes\u2014processes that should fully institutionalize reforms and install them as the governing vision of our society.\r\nConceivably, we can continue on the road of reform and national transformation, trusting solely in the efficacy of crisis leadership, more specifically the leadership of the President, and even perhaps achieve our goals with greater efficiency and speed.\r\nBut let me be the first to remind this assembly and our people that this is a course which, while admitting of less perils, exposes us to the risk of prolonged acculturation and attachment to constitutional authoritarianism.\r\nAnd we must affirm, especially now as we commence the work of this assembly, that here in our country, we are prepared to meet the challenge of making democracy real and that we can demonstrate in practice that represen\u00adtative government can serve as an effective means for making reform and development as effective, as dynamic, as strong as our crisis government and better in the long term because it enshrines what is most fundamental to a free society; the consent and participation of the governed. This, then, is the burden of the Batasang Pambansa: to show to the world that it is as effective if not better than the crisis government.\r\nHow to give permanence and continuity to the reforms initiated and instituted by crisis government is then the task that should occupy our precious talents and energies. For it goes beyond mere polemics and profoundly touches the substance of challenges, problems, cares, and hopes which mark our national life today.\r\nIt now remains for us to fashion policies and programs capable of translating ideas into action, hopes into national realities, and constituting a compre\u00adhensive program of government, perhaps faster than even the crisis govern\u00adment.\r\nAnd therefore, these are marked out in a five-year development program, as well as in the 10-year development program, and the program prepared up to the year 2000.\r\nThe basic rationale behind the simultaneous preparation of these develop\u00adment plans is that we need a broad perspective of the desired path of growth for the national economy over the long run. Within the longer context, develop\u00adment planners have a basis for estimating the amount of time required to attain the planned objectives and for formulating and instituting the appropriate strategies to support the program of government,\r\nIn the implementation of this program of national development, it shall be necessary to seek the participation of the whole government machinery at all levels\u2014national, regional, and local\u2014especially during the stage of prepara\u00adtion.\r\nWhat we have achieved during the previous plan period, although substan\u00adtial and impressive, I must repeat, is comparatively limited compared to what we in the assembly still must achieve. The development strategy having been proved to be sound and effective, the assembly can now follow along the lines already initiated.\r\nIn our two major strategies for development, for instance, the stress is on balanced agro-industrial growth on the one hand and on the other, the develop\u00adment of our human resources. In these two major strategies of the crisis govern\u00adment, we see the levers which we can confidently work toward the development not only of a small part of our country but of the whole country, all sectors and all regions.\r\nWhen we speak of human resources, we do so with the expansion of social services and opportunities as our major tools for change.\r\nProgressively, as greater productivity and economic efficiency will allow, we should direct more and more of our resources to this essential aspect of national development\u2014our human resources.\r\nThese activities in the economic sphere are all reducible to specific target for achievement during the next five years.\r\nAllow me to point out, in terms of the real gross national product, that the economy is envisioned to grow at an average annual GNP growth rate of 7.7% during the next five years; that is, from P83.250 million in 1978 to P112.214 million by 1982.\r\nReal per capita income is envisioned to grow by 4.7% from a level of P1.796 to P2.157 in 1982.\r\nConversely, the growth of population is projected to significantly decline from the present 2.0% growth rate to 2.3% by 1982.\r\nWe fully envision that within the next two years, we shall reach the turning point in the national economy, and this the assembly must watch as a critical point. This point will be wherein the agriculture and industry sectors will exhibit almost equal shares of output to total net domestic product.\r\nThis view of the development challenge underlines in each and every case our basic economy policies, particularly those governing the role of private enterprise in the economy. There have been questions raised as to the role of private enterprise. Let me restate it again: It remains our fundamental policy that private enterprise must serve as our primary agent in the realization of economic achievement, and government must enter only those areas of economic endeavor in which private enterprise is not prepared or able to service needs and meet desired targets.\r\nBut let me remind everyone that while we encourage private enterprise and initiative and recognize it and oppose the abolition of private property, the Constitution requires that the government regulate wealth in the interest of the general welfare. And it must ever be our concern to temper the operations of private enterprise with the claims of social justice.\r\nSecond, we must now devote greater emphasis and resources to the satisfaction of social needs and the promotion of individual welfare. With the new stability and growth of our economy, we can now extend the horizons of our concerns from the provision of the basic necessities of life toward the broadening of social opportunities for every man, woman, and child in this country.\r\nUnder our Five-Year Development Plan, programs for social services such as health, nutrition, and welfare will be expanded on a nationwide scale, with special stress on the provision of relief and assistance to the very poor among our people.\r\nThe expansion of social opportunities in the form of employment and edu\u00adcation, already a major focus of effort during the last five years, will be the principal vehicle for the promotion of social welfare. And when we speak of social welfare, we speak not only of a few areas in the country but of the entire country. This is one of the basic reasons for the organization of the Department of Human Settlements and Environmental Management.\r\nDespite the yearly growth of our labor force, we shall keep the unemploy\u00adment rate at a low level of 4% annually. The expected sectoral shifts in production and other economic activities are envisioned to affect the sectoral composition of employment. The greater part of the new entrants to the labor force will gradually move away from agriculture into the industry and services sector. Incentives to more employment and labor-incentive activities will be based on a sound and favorable policy on wages and incomes.\r\nEqually vital to a sound employment situation is the development of our human resources through education and manpower training. This social pro\u00adgram represents today one of the heaviest commitments of government, and it will continue to be a high priority in the new Five-Year Plan. I commend this priority program to this assembly.\r\nWe reject the claim that education is not getting its proper share of the national budget. Indeed, allocations to education have increased considerably during the last five years, compared to previous years. And we have instituted programs that go well beyond classroom training to provide skills training to out-of-school youth and to adults. Investments in education are after all the real fuel for the engine of development.\r\nAs an added new concern in the social sector, which again comes directly under the Department of Human Settlements, we should now attend to the housing needs of the population, to urban reforms, and to the quality of our human settlements in general. Our new housing program will involve not only the provision of shelter but also the improvement of the entire environment especially in marginal areas. Over the five-year period, we envision the provision of direct housing and the upgrading of sites and services to benefit directly 547,000 households throughout the country.\r\nAnd, of course, we must endeavor to secure public order and civility in our social life and maintain the greatest vigilance and care over the security of the Republic.\r\nDespite the creditable success of our peace and order campaign and counterinsurgency efforts, threats to national stability remain.\r\nWe must not be deluded into thinking that the insurgency has been nipped merely because part of its apparatus and its leadership has been successfully dismantled. They are rebuilding as usual; the same situation is true with respect to crime.\r\nIn southwestern Mindanao and Sulu, we have had to meet the most violent opposition to authority in these past few years from a secessionist movement, which apparently is supported from the outside.\u00a0 Our government has commit\u00adted valuable resources in order to win the peace. We have suffered from deficiency of resources, we have suffered casualties and failure in our efforts\u2014which, however, is a transitory failure in our efforts at maintaining the peace.\r\nBut today, the gains that we have fostered encourage us to believe that the peace can be won honorably and justly to the satisfaction of all parties. Negotia\u00adtions with the rebels have involved as of now not only the regular channels of the foreign office but even the personal diplomacy of the First Lady. These negotiations which we regard as conversations between our government and some Filipino nationals produced a ceasefire agreement which surely saved lives, although it has lately run into some difficulties.\r\nThese conversations we should be prepared to pursue. As a matter of fact, three of our ambassadors have been designated to meet with the leadership of the rebellion in a mutually acceptable venue. The one problem that presents itself, however, is the report confirmed by various sources that there has been a fragmentation in the leadership of the secessionist movement, making it difficult for us to ascertain which faction would be in a position to enforce any agreement that might be arrived at.\r\nIt is important, however, that the Batasan now place itself behind the socioeconomic and political reform program for the affected areas in Mindanao: Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. It would be helpful if we could now work on the formal establishment of what had been promised to be two autonomous regions within the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic, as referred to in the plebiscite of April 1977 under a new local autonomy act. I therefore commend to this assembly the drafting and passage of a local autonomy act.\r\nAs I have said, essential to this vision of domestic tranquility and develop\u00adment is the maintenance of a sound policy in our relations with other nations and the world.\r\nOur foreign relations today are governed by an outlook that looks upon foreign policy as a tool for national development, that looks upon every nation as a friend and ally, and that regards our place in the family of nations as one deserving of respect.\r\nDominating our foreign policy agenda are our trade and security negotia\u00adtions with the United States, our trade treaty negotiations with Japan, and the increasing number of decisions we are called upon every day to make with our partners in ASEAN.\r\nWith the United Stales, what is involved is the review of a historic relation\u00adship that has grown in war and in peace; and the searching question above all is how long and under what terms, shall we allow American forces to make use, if at all, of our military bases in Clark and Subic, among others. In the matter of trade, we are anxious to find out how well disposed the United States is in giving our products equitable treatment, and how willing it is to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.\r\nWith Japan, we are embarked on the renegotiation of a treaty of amity, navigation and commerce, which ought at the very least to correct the onerous provisions of the treaty which ran out in January 1977.\r\nWith ASEAN, we are concerned with making regional industrial com\u00adplementation and detailed cooperation work, so that within the region we can begin to develop our own technologies and be in a better position to meet our own needs, and not always be disadvantaged in dealing with the big trading blocs and the industrial economies.\r\nWith the rest of the world, we have varying degrees of exposure\u2014some sustained initiatives in the European Economic Community, developing contacts with members of Comecon, the Middle East, and the entire membership of the Third World.\r\nAs always, development diplomacy shall continue to serve particularly our actions in the negotiation of treaties and agreements with other nations.\u00a0 It shall guide us in resolving those irritants that remain of a passing era that made us the charge of another country. It shall define our place among the nations of the Third World. It shall enable us to maintain fruitful relations with the Com\u00admunist countries. It shall strengthen our actions and commitments to the build\u00ading of the ASEAN community.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most important because this assembly is itself a manifestation of it, we must attend to the continuing normalization of our political life and the methodical construction of a truly democratic political order.\r\nThis is a road which we must travel with patience and determination, free of the blinders that had once hampered the fruitful workings of democratic processes in our country, and free of these constraints that tend to divide rather than unite us in our political life.\r\nWe need above all to be clearheaded about the kind of political change we want and the kind of system we must erect.\r\nAll too often, some of us mistake political normalization for the mere relaxation of those controls exercised by our crisis government. All too often, some of us imagine that a simple return to the freewheeling tendencies of our past political order will suffice to install political change.\r\nI reject this notion of political change as feeble, sterile, and illusory. For we did not struggle this long, nor did we achieve our gains at such great cost, only to revert to a political order empty of vision and vitality.\r\nNo. Political change should in fact strengthen and enhance the quality of government in our country. Political change should be a means for the greater participation of our people in government, and not merely the servant of the ambitions and hopes of a few.\r\nIn this spirit, therefore, must we construe the mandate of our people that this assembly serve as a signal bridge in the evolution of our political life.\r\nNow, included in the authority and mandate of this assembly is the authority to convert itself into a constituent body for the purpose of amending the Consti\u00adtution. Some have suggested that the Constitution be amended immediately to return our transitional government to any other kind of government. My prompt reply to this is that we owe it to ourselves and our people to treat the Constitution with more respect and reverence. It is neither a transitory nor a permanent solution to our problems, but we should proceed with our political experiment with parliamentarianism or the mixed presidential-parliamentary system and give it a few years before we begin to talk, if at all, of going back to a system we had chosen to abandon. It is my considered view that our own experience as an independent and sovereign nation should ultimately give us the form of government we desire and need.\r\nAs of now our gradual passage into parliamentary government has given us a mixture of the presidential and parliamentary systems, which, however temporary, lends us some powerful insights of the needs of modern-day governmental. We have much to discover and learn where we are and our position should allow us to grow in our concept and practice of government without the limitations of previous experience. We ought to be bold in our imagination, and in the process of experimentation we should not fear to innovate, nor fear to discover a system uniquely our own.\r\nI therefore commend this assembly to its work.\r\nThe Constitution grants to the President and Prime Minister the continuing power to legislate.\r\nI wish to announce now and make clear that I have no wish to deprive the interim Batasang Pambansa the opportunity to discharge its legislative authority on any issue, especially those of great import and urgency to the nation.\u00a0 My greatest accomplishment as a leader will lie not in having been able to save the nation from the incapacity of an inept legislature, but in being able to say at the end of the day that because of an alert and competent legislature I did not have to use any of my standby powers to effect necessary and urgent legis\u00adlation.\r\nThis message is clear: Political will is as necessary today as it was during the last five years to mobilize the energies of our people for development and change.\r\nThe establishment of the interim Batasang Pambansa extends public authority from the solitary seat of the Presidency to a broader spectrum of the national leadership; but it is hardly the intent of our people that the sharing of power should diffuse the national political will to develop and modernize.\u00a0 Neither is it our desire that the political order toward which we are moving should produce a bifurcated vision of the national future.\r\nThe converse is true: We have great faith that a broad representation of the national leadership will result in the convergence of interests and energies so strong and resolute in the pursuit of national ideals that it will in fact be wiser and more effective than even the crisis leadership.\r\nIt is in this light that we must respond to those questions concerning the continuation of martial law, the duration of this assembly\u2019s work, the holding of local elections, and such other political questions as have arisen with the convening of this assembly.\r\nThe questions are not to be answered separately from how this transitory body discharges its mission. They cannot be resolved except in direct and earnest examination of our evolving political life, of how democratic processes actually operate.\r\nIt will be unrealistic to assume that the task of this assembly can be completed in one or two years.\r\nIt would be presumptuous for anyone now to tell any member of this assem\u00adbly to finish the work mandated by the Constitution within a certain period of time. This is a discretion and wisdom that has been allocated lo the members of this assembly, and no one should deprive the members of such an allocated power.\r\nEqually, we can only make an educated guess as to when it would be possible, and propitious, or wise, for us to lift martial law, especially since the discretion of imposing and lifting martial law is in the hands of the President. The fact that the Batasan exists assures us that the proper time, we would lift martial law without being sucked into a legislative vacuum, which would other\u00adwise surely happen if the Batasan did not exist to take over the lawmaking function of the crisis presidency. But the fact that the Batasan is here, ready to discharge its responsibility, unfortunately does not make for an automatic lifting of martial law.\r\nTherefore, neither am I prepared to speculate on the holding of local elec\u00adtions at this time. But I would like to announce now that I have no intention of immediately calling local elections. We have not recovered from the divisiveness brought about by the last one. To speak of local elections now is to invite disaster, for that would guarantee the rechanneling of the energies of the IBP members and of the citizenry towards factionalism and petty party or group conflicts.\r\nI have already received reports to the effect that even without any call to local elections, warring factions are now forming and girding for political combat to the detriment of public welfare. For certainly, the members of the Batasan, being political leaders, would be interested more in working for the victory of their local political organizations than in the task of legislation if local elections were to be called now.\r\nIt is imperative that prior to the calling of local elections, we first take steps to strengthen leadership in our local governments.\u00a0 The elections last April were revealing of the inefficiency of many in our local governments, and of the loss of trust in many of them by their constituencies. The incumbency of incompetents in local governments, in the event of an election prematurely called, locates them in an unwarranted position of advantage that could result in the distortion of the process of strengthening the political leadership.\r\nIt is meet therefore that the President be allowed the time to take the neces\u00adsary step of removing those who are no longer effective in office, and of ensur\u00ading the flow of our programs from national to local level, before the nation holds local elections.\r\nWhat this assembly should now devote itself to is the strengthening of the structure and administration of local governments. For it is when powers and responsibilities are effectively administered by the local governments that a real sharing of the apparatus of government power is effective.\r\nLocal autonomy should rank high in our agenda in this assembly, and if we consider what we have achieved since 1972 in this respect, political change will be considerable.\r\nWe should endeavor to channel more opportunities to local governments for their participation in the implementation of development programs. And beyond enhancing their role, we must take care to look and examine deeply how in fact individual local governments are faring in the total development effort. For it is a fact that the record varies considerably from region to region, prov\u00adince to province, largely because of local leadership differences.\r\nThis is the reason why the Department of Local Governments and Com\u00admunity Development must now work it out with the new Department of Human Settlements and Environmental Management in their respective jurisdictions and functions.\r\nFor this reason, our people will expect this assembly to devote some of its energies to deliberate well on the proposed Local Government Code, which the Cabinet will submit to this assembly soon. This assembly will be called upon to make an assessment of how the regions as administrative units in our national administration have either succeeded or failed, whether they have contributed to the social and political integration of the nation, or whether they have spawned new seeds of divisiveness.\r\nWhat is true concerning the strengthening of local governments must be time of the strengthening of the government bureaucracy.\r\nThe weaknesses of our government bureaucracy were born of a corrupt political system. The enervation of the political system was due to a bureaucracy that could not effectively discharge the tasks of government.\r\nThe principle implied by this sad experience is a very simple but often neglected one; it is a fact that effective government is the single, most important input into the kind of political change and development we covet. Government performance needs what is encouraging and promising in our political life.\u00a0 On the other hand, no amount of elections can install a strong political order where the task of government is poorly administered.\r\nThus, the professionalization of the civil service should rank high in our priorities.\r\nI am happy to announce that I have just signed a new administrative code which embodies all the laws governing the reorganization of the bureaucracy, the conduct of government, and the deportment of those in the government service, which shall henceforth be our principal guide in the continued reform, professionalization, and revitalization of the machinery of government.\r\nBut the morality and competence we aspire to see in the members of the service must also be matched by those of us who hold elective office. And it should not be the least of our concerns here that this assembly does not go the way of its predecessor.\r\nIn this cluster of concerns, there are enormous challenges and problems to engage and test the mettle of this body. There is enough work to do for each and all of us, without our having to be detained by the petty rivalries of politicians, without our having to search for imaginary monsters to destroy and false causes to try our energies.\r\nThe challenge is before us, and the initiative is for us to seize, to ensure that this assembly will fulfill its historic mission.\r\nAs we proceed to integrate the executive and legislative branches of government, we shall then nurture the seeds of renewal in our national life and find a secure and permanent home for our vision of the future.\r\nAnd let it never be forgotten that this is a burden and a challenge that are ours alone to bear. The time when we could look to others for the fulfillment of hopes and aspirations is long past. Only in self-reliance, in the confidence that we are equal to our tasks, shall we reap.\r\nFor this challenge of national self-strengthening, we shall have great need of unity of purpose and effort within this government and this assembly. We shall have great need of unswerving faith in the new institution we are summoned to erect.\r\nAnd we must draw sustenance from the larger sense of community and union among our people.\r\nIt shall be the policy of the government to mold a truly national consensus behind all that we undertake in the name of the people and the country, confident that our course will lead us irretrievably to our destiny.\r\nTowards this end, our government will not take the following initiatives.\r\nYou perhaps have noted that with respect to the opposition, we have taken the initiative to remove the irritants that have strained their participation in our political life. We are prepared to listen to their counsel.\r\nIt shall remain the paramount concern of our government to unite our country behind the cause of justice and dignity, to lift those who live in conditions of poverty, ignorance and lack of opportunity, so that together they may form one united political community. And regardless of differences in our views, we shall strive to be one nation, in which one will be free to disagree with another without undermining national unity. We shall be a nation with one purpose, no matter how differently individuals express themselves.\r\n\u201cIsang bansa, isang diwa\u201d shall henceforth be our national motto and by virtue of a decree I have signed, it will now be incorporated in the great seal of the Republic, and be made known to every Filipino as the slogan of every individual as it is of the nation.\r\nThis is not to say that our nationhood shall live merely in slogans.\r\nWe shall now seek to enlarge the democratic dialogue among all sectors of society and shall exert all efforts to ensure that violence does not subvert or re\u00adplace the free exchange of opinions and ideas, that dialogue should begin in this seat of representative government and must extend to every forum in our country.\r\nFor this, the rule of law must stand supreme in our society, and we must look to the strength and independence of our judiciary to keep the channels of justice inviolate and secure. Much has been achieved in revitalizing the civilian courts, and certainly under the administration of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. We shall continue with measures to strengthen them. To this end, while the Presidency has the power to replace judges by accepting resignations, I now announce that I have no intention of utilizing this power.\r\nNapakalaking karangalan para sa inyong lingkod na mamuno sa makasaysayang yugtong ito ng ating kasaysayan, lalung-lalo na sa walang katulad na panahon ng pagbahago ng mga balakid at hamon. Karaniwang ang isang Punong Ministro ay halal lamang sa isang nakararaming lapian sa isang parliamento o batasan, ngunit naiiba at namumukod sa lahat ang inyong abang lingkod na inihalal ng ating bayan sa pamamagitan ng ating Saligang Batas. Labis akong nagpapasalamat sa bagay na ito at nakatitiyak ang lahat na tutumbasan ko ito ng ubos kaya at walang pasubaling paglilingkod.\r\nIbang-iba ang pangyayari at kalagayan sa panahong ito, subali\u2019t waring inuulit natin sa araw na ito ang ilang mahahalagang yugto sa kasay\u00adsayan ng ating Republika. Binubuksan natin ang kapulungang ito na taglay sa diwa ang kahulugan ng Kongreso sa Malolos ng 1978. Wala na ang agam-agam at pangamba ng kabiguang nakalambong noon sa ating unang Republika. Binubuksan natin ang kapulungang ito na angkin ang tiwala ng Unang Asemblea ng Pilipinas noong 1907. Nasa atin ang kakayahang magsarili at magpalakad sa ating sariling pamahalaan ng taglay ang talinong bunga ng karanasang natipon sa nakalipas na mga taon. Wala na ang agam-agam na kailangan pa nating sundin ang kagustuhan ng alinmang panginoong banyaga. Binubuksan natin ang kupulungang ito na taglay ang pananabik ng Kongreso ng Commonwealth noong 1935.\u00a0 At ang nasa isip ay ang katotohanang tayo lamang ang maaaring humawak ng kapalaran ng ating lahi. Binubuksan natin ang kapuluang ito na taglay ang matayog na pangarap ng unang Kongreso ng Republika ng Pilipinas noong 1946 pagkatapos ng digmaan. Wala nga lamang ang guho at pinsala ng digmaan na naging dahilan ng sapin-saping suliraning pangkabuhayan.\r\nAng kasaysayan ng ating lahi ay isang walang katapusang pagharap sa mga suliranin upang matamo ang katatagan at makatugon sa hamon na lumikha ng isang mabisa at angkop na tagapagbatas. Tuwing tayo ay makakadarama ng ginhawa ng pagkakaisa, katapatan, at katatagan, lagi tayong nahaharap sa pagsubok na makapagtayo ng batasang tunay na makatutugon sa mga hamon ng krisis ng pagsubok na muli nating haharapin ngayon.\r\nNasa harap ng kapulungang ito ngayon ang katipunan ng mga hamon at pagsubok sa nakalipas na mga Kongreso, at ito na sana ang pangwakas na pagsubok kung makakaya natin gamitin ang demokrasya bilang mabisang sangkap ng katatagan at kaunlarang pambansa. Bagaman at kailangan pa ring magpatuloy ang pansamantalang pamahalaan, taglay ng kapulungang ito ang binhi ng matatag at masiglang lehislaturang tutugon sa ating pangangailangan kung ihahandog natin dito ang lahat ng ating talino at kakayahan.\r\nTayo ngayon ay isang bansang pinalakas ng mga pagsubok na ating pinagdaanan, higit na nagkakaisa pagkaraan ng mga sigalutang dinanas, at higit na handa sa anumang uri ng pagsubok at suliranin. Natapos nating lampasan ang mahihigpit na balakid sa nakaraang lima-at-kalahating taon. Sa liwanag ng makabuluhang yugtong ito ng ating buhay bilang bansa at lahi, magagawa natin ang ating tungkuling pagtahak sa landas ng katuparan ng ating matayog na pangarap na pag-unlad, pagkakapantay-pantay, at ng tunay na demokrasya.\r\nSagutin at tungkulin ng kapulungang ito na simulan ang pagtahak sa naiguhit na landas.\r\nThese measures should provide a fertile ground for the orderly and effective operations of this assembly, and I should hope that this body will in time embody and reflect for our nation the efficacy of democratic discussion and deliberation as a means for the achievement of national purposes and aspira\u00adtions.\r\nWe, in this assembly, are the final repository of this trust, which if we discharge with care and dedication, will give permanent meaning to the struggles that we have waged all these many years, and will strengthen our people\u2019s faith in the future of this nation.\r\nNone of us can fail to be exalted by the trust that brought us to this interim Batasang Pambansa\u2014the first legislative body to convene since our proclama\u00adtion of crisis government in 1972.\r\nAnd for me, no honor can be greater than to preside over this historic mission of the government at a time of great opportunity and challenge.\r\nA prime minister usually owes his position to his party; but by their generosity, our people have given me a direct constitutional mandate. For this, I am truly grateful, and I shall try to deserve this mandate by serving the nation to the best of my energies and my gifts.\r\nOur conditions and circumstances today are vastly different, but there is a sense in which this occasion recaptures certain moments in the history of our Republic.\r\nWe open this assembly with the same sense of new beginning as the Malolos Congress of 1898, but without the sense of doom that hovered over its deliberations and shadowed the frail existence of the first Republic.\r\nWe open this assembly, confident like the first Philippine Assembly of 1907 of our capacity for self-government, but a little wiser from the experience gained over the years and without the anxiety or the need to conform to the wishes of a colonial master.\r\nWe open this assembly with the same sense of anticipation as the Common\u00adwealth Congress of 1935, with the added awareness that we and we alone are charting our sovereign passage into parliamentary democracy.\r\nAnd we open this assembly with the same high hopes as the first Congress of the Philippine Republic of 1946, without the destruction and ruins of war that made for untold economic difficulties that often dictated compromise.\r\nThe history of our nation indelibly etches for us the crucial tie between the struggle for national survival and stability and the challenge to create an effective and representative lawmaking body.\r\nAt crucial points in our history, when we had achieved at long last a strong sense of national cohesion and vitality, we have had to face the test of erecting a legislature that would serve the test of crisis and adversity.\r\nTime and time again we faced this test. Today, we face it again. It may be that we face in this assembly the culmination of all the challenges and the frustrations of the past, the trials that had engaged our historic congresses, the fateful test of our national capacity for making constitutional democracy our unfailing instrument of national vitality and purpose. For the circumstances surrounding this historic assembly, while yet admitting the need for the continued enforcement of emergency government, bear the seeds of a strong and dynamic legislature that will surely germinate if we give it the full commit\u00adment of our talents and energies.\r\nWe are today a nation made stronger by the trials that we have weathered, more cohesive for the waves of conflict which we have experienced, and better prepared for challenges by the many crises which we surmounted during the last five-and-a-half years.\r\nIn the wake of this eventful period in our national life, we can and we must chart the course that will fully attain for us our greatest hopes for freedom, for progress, for equality, and for true democracy.\r\nIt is the unique and historic charge of this assembly to set that course. It is, I hope, the charge which we as a country will meet confidently. I have no doubt that the members of this assembly will discharge this mission with dedication, with patriotism, and with success.", "title": "A Bold Experiment"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Malaca\u00f1an Palace on September 21, 1973]\r\nOne year ago today, I signed Proclamation No. 1081 placing the entire country under martial law.\r\nAs President of the Republic, I saw it as my clear and inescapable duty to meet the rebellion against our duly constituted government, the anarchy in our social life, the paralysis of the economy, the disintegration of our bureaucracy.\r\nWith God\u2019s clear light and our people\u2019s vigorous support, we involved the full powers of the Constitution to meet the threats to our Republic and build a new society.\r\nMan in his presumption has always claimed the advances we call civilization as his handiwork.\r\nOften we disregard the unknown intervention of God and the logic and consequence of history and events.\r\nThis was time in the past. It is true now of what we proudly point to as the almost miraculous achievements we ascribe to the New Society.\r\nMany of the advances that we can list down are but the logical consequences of the decisive rupture from an old and stricken society.\r\nAs soon as the moral and political decision was made, the rebirth followed.\r\nWhat we now see are the attributes of that rejection of our degrading past.\r\nThe rectification of our errors and the fruits of our endeavors spring from the first momentous decision of September 21, 1972.\r\nWe worked hard to be where we are today. Each one of us has a personal testimony. But there is a common experience we share as a people and as a nation that survives to record the real change in our country. This experience is our collective effort in laying the foundations of a new society.\r\nThe achievement is yours. The symbols of our national progress are familiar to you. But let me outline them for our record.\r\nA year ago, we faced a crisis of survival. We have surmounted the crisis.\r\nThe man who feared to walk his own street has been freed from his fears; he can now walk his city.\r\nThe farmer who feared for his cattle can now sleep.\r\nThe man whose father tilled another man\u2019s land will no longer sire children who will till the land of the landowner\u2019s sons. Together they will have their own lands to till.\r\nThe man who once surrounded himself with hired guns has been put in jail or reduced to insignificance. Those who used to seek his influence can now go to government offices on their own and be sure they would be served. The small man who did not dare to raise his voice can now speak and be heard. Poverty is no longer the solitude of the poor. It has become the concern of all.\r\nThe armed force of the rebellion has been crushed. The danger still remains, but the rebellion can no longer reestablish itself to its old position, unless we allow it. The urban terrorists have been checked. The Rightist conspirators, too. Over half a million firearms taken from, or surrendered by, the population will never find their way again into private hands. One hundred forty-five so-called private armies that have been disbanded will no longer intimidate innocent men. Thousands of criminals, kidnapping gangs, crime syndicates, and terrorists, now caught and jailed, will no longer pose a menace to our countrymen. The national crime rate has dropped. The once-troubled area of Mindanao will henceforth be a showcase of harmonious work.\r\nIn the economy, we have set new records of growth. As of the beginning of September, the international reserve stood at $739 million, the highest in our history. The balance of payments showed a surplus of $612 million.\r\nIn the first eight months of 1973, our export receipts totaled $1.121 billion, $408 million and 57% higher than the receipts of the comparable period in 1972. This has resulted in a favorable balance of trade amounting to P912.9 million. Our decision to open trade with nontraditional markets such as the Communist countries resulted, over a 12-month period, in export receipts from these sources alone, of $44 million, with 75% coming from the People\u2019s Republic of China. For the first time in our history, we posted a favorable balance of trade of $59 million with Japan. Although our shift from an import-oriented to an export-oriented economy has barely begun, we expect this year\u2019s exports to exceed our $1.4 billion target.\r\nIn the stock market, transactions multiplied 10 times in volume, from last year\u2019s monthly average of P49.7 million, to the present monthly average of P504.3 million.\r\nMining and oil exploration have exploded into profitable activity. Full protection and assistance have been guaranteed to mining claims, thus separating claim jumpers from real claimants.\r\nIn energy exploration, we have made it highly attractive for domestic and foreign investors to join the search for oil and other sources of energy. A Petroleum Board has been created, and the Oil Industry Commission has been attached to the NEDA, signifying the high rating given to oil in our priorities.\r\nAs of today, a total of 18 oil firms from the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Australia, and Bermuda have joined the oil hunt in the Philippines, with six of them signing service contracts. This includes the biggest firms in the world.\r\nIn investment, the record has surpassed all previous records. From September to December last year, 52 firms, including Ford, with a combined investment total of P671.7 million, applied for incentives. As of July this year, 31 multinational firms with an aggregate capitalization of P302 million applied for BOI listing. In that same month, 37 foreign-owned companies were granted permit to operate locally, with a combined capitalization of P20 million. From September to the end of August this year, applications from foreign investors to the BOI totaled P237.9 million, or more than double the figure for the same period immediately preceding the proclamation of martial law. At least seven investment banks with foreign equity have registered with the BOI. In all, some 250 industrial and agricultural projects were registered as of June 30, 1973, with a total investment of P5.7 billion.\r\nThe Progressive Car Manufacturing Program of the Philippines performed according to schedule, with the five participants\u2014Ford Philippines, General Motors Philippines, Delta Motors Corporation, DMG, and Chrysler Philippines\u2014meeting the 10% local content requirement as of June 30. They are expected to fulfill the 15% content requirement for the second semester by December this year. Ford has begun construction of a body stamping plant in the export processing zone of Mariveles at a cost of P257 million. General Motors is constructing a P137 million transmission plant in Muntinlupa. Delta Motors has just completed us engine block plant.\r\nThere was no letup in our effort to support the growth of the economy with infrastructure. We have increased capital expenditures to P5.3 billion\u2014an increase from 15% to 45% of the budget. The integrated development approach allowed us to concentrate on a number of area development programs, including the Manila Bay Project and Mindanao. The Manila Bay Development Project envisions the reclamation of a 1.5-kilometer-wide strip of land with an area of 10,700 hectares from Cavite through Manila to Bataan, on which will be constructed a six-lane highway, sewage, flood control and drainage complex, among others. In Mindanao, P496 million has been appropriated for rehabilitation and development. Five major road-building projects are being undertaken by local and foreign firms on contract with the government. Aside from these, we have the Bicol River Basin Project, Pampanga Delta, Candaba Swamps, the Metropolitan Manila Transport and Land Use. Construction of the Pan Philippine Highway continues and we expect its completion by the end of 1975. Last July we inaugurated one of the longest bridges in the world between Samar and Leyte, the San Juanico Bridge. The Opon-Mandaue Bridge in Cebu and the Lucban Bridge in Cagayan were also inaugurated. Rural electrification has reduced the cost of electricity to the common man, and is lighting up far-flung areas of the country.\r\nMeanwhile, we authorized the Export Processing Zone in Mariveles, upon its incorporation, to incur up to $100 million from abroad, in order to hasten its development. Fully developed, the zone should house P1.8 billion in investments, generating at least 205,941 jobs and producing at least P2.1 billion a year in exports.\r\nAt the same time, the development of small- and medium-scale industries was given a new start this year. Liberalized government policy has facilitated the establishment of small- and medium-scale industries all over the country, as a spur to rural development. The countryside must now share in progress and must catch up with the urban areas. This is both an economic and environmental necessity.\r\nNot only have we sought to open up the rural areas to industrial development. We have also begun to develop as many tourist attractions in these areas, as part of our tourist development program. After September, the Philippines became a favored tourist destination, and for the last 12 months, we posted an increase in tourist traffic of 107%. This tourist influx has not only given us an evolving major dollar earner for the economy but has also given impetus to some of our environmental programs like the cleanliness and beautification drive and major historical reconstruction projects. The Pasig is now being cleaned, Chinatown is being dressed up, Intramuros is being reconstructed, while in the South, Zamboanga and Marawi are being developed.\r\nIn food production, we had to weather one of the worst droughts ever to hit our country, ironically after the disastrous floods that inundated most of Luzon last year. While we turned to outside sources for our immediate needs, we launched Masagana 99. The Green Revolution, of course, continues; but with Masagana 99, we aimed to double the present average per hectare yield of rice. We made available P305 million in loans to 350,000 farmers tilling 500,000 hectares in 53 provinces. At the same time, we launched \u201cPalayang Bayan\u201d with a total coverage of 150,000 hectares of heretofore uncultivated public lands. We also set the price of palay at P35 per cavan to encourage production.\r\nWe had to adopt certain measures to meet the temporary shortage in rice supply. We rationed rice to the hard-hit areas, encouraged the use of substitutes, as well as a mixture with corn. We have now passed the most critical part of the shortage. We can now look to the first Masagana harvest in October.\r\nThis was, for many of us, a most difficult situation. But given the challenge, our people were willing to sacrifice and organize themselves to help find a common remedy to the problem.\r\nOur economic performance stands in marked contrast not only to past years of poor economic activity in our country but also to the difficulties encounters it by the mighty economies all over the world during the year. The entry into our country of capital is a demonstration of faith and confidence both in the economy, and in the future of our nation.\r\nEasily the most meaningful reform in the society is the emancipation of the farmer from his age-old bondage to the soil. This means the liberation of about a million farmers who have tilled without owning the land. As of the middle of this month, 119,655 certificates of land transfer have been issued, involving 148,014,867 hectares and 85,818 tenant-tillers. In 62 provinces, 538,652 tenant-tillers have been identified and interviewed, preparatory to the issuance of the same certificates.\r\nAs for the laborer, we sought reforms that contribute to his dignity as a working man. We have just finished a Comprehensive Survey for Employment by world experts. Through the National Labor Relations Commission, we instituted a system of swift arbitration and conciliation between labor and management. As of the end of August this year, the Commission settled 4.576 out of 5,841 complaints, resulting in the payment of P58.28 million to claimants. Labor disputes that used to take 20 to 25 years are now settled within 37 days.\r\nEmployment reform also continued, and we succeeded in cutting down the unemployment rate to 5%. By requiring certain agencies of the government, and encouraging the private sector to give priority to labor-intensive projects, we were able to generate more jobs for our people. Manpower and youth training continues to occupy a high priority in our human resources program. Some 13 public employment offices have been set up all over the country to gather labor market information, match available skills with available jobs, and work out employment generating schemes in cooperation with local governments, civic groups, and the private sector. Women and minors, and the long-neglected domestic help, all got their due from our labor reforms.\r\nIn housing, we instituted a more reasonable and effective rent control law, increased the housing allotment to P970 million, with 80% to be borne by the private sector. The capitalization of the National Housing Corpo\u00adration was increased to P250 million to make it a more effective agency for low-cost housing. At the same time, some 45,570 squatters were moved to government resettlement projects.\r\nIn education, we began a reform that seeks to improve the relevancy of the curricula to the building of a society of enlightened and productive men. We have started to redirect the school system so that it does not continue to in\u00adculcate in the young prejudices against work, as it did in the past. State support for early education has been broadened by the new Constitution to include high school education in cases where funds are available for the purpose. Various means to reduce the cost of learning tools, including books, have also been adopted.\r\nWe have not overlooked the care of the health of the population. Govern\u00adment health services and Medicare have been broadened and expanded, parti\u00adcularly in the rural areas, where health conditions, in spite of our efforts, often determine life or death. We have more rural health units serving our people, more hospitals in the provinces, more workers in the field; but these increases only open our eyes to the larger possibilities of public health care.\r\nAlongside this program, we began a serious effort to safeguard the environ\u00adment from pollution and the other hazards to life engendered along the way to industrialization. We shall not commit the mistake of other countries of facing this problem when it has already arrived and reached critical proportions. We have created an environmental center to map out our program against this threat to man.\r\nThe result of all these social programs, whether directed towards the achievement of social justice or the broadening of social services to the people, has been to increase the chances of every man, woman, and child of this country for a long and productive life, for a living place in harmony with their hopes, and for an equal share in the benefits of progress.\r\nBut all this we must premise on the radical change in the political order and the political culture.\r\nWe ratified a new Constitution that has given a firm and formal basis to the sweeping reforms that we instituted by decree.\r\nAll the social and economic reforms that had been denied us by the old legislative process are now enduring features of the law of the land.\r\nThe sanctified concept of private property, which permitted the rise of an exploitative oligarchy, has been displaced by a democratized concept of private wealth.\r\nThe new Constitution declares as national policy the need to democratize wealth and spread social justice.\r\nThis has enabled us to move confidently towards the complete extirpation of the monopoly of privileges and power by the old oligarchy in our society.\r\nAnd in place of this monopoly of power by the rich, there has been a resurgence of the power of the people to determine their future. Sovereignty has passed from those who claimed to represent the people to the Filipino people themselves.\r\nToday, what began as a movement to ratify the new Constitution by the direct and open exercise of initiative by the people has become the mainspring of political power and decision making. Through the barangay, the voice of every citizen has found a direct channel to the citadels of government and the heart of the Presidency. Every citizen now has a chance to speak on the issues that affect the national community, to harmonize his interests with those of the community, and to act directly on matters that touch deeply his individual and communal life.\r\nWe saw this emerging political order at work in the recent series of con\u00adsultation with the people on national issues last July.\r\nWe saw the barangay at work in the national effort to meet the recent rice crisis. For the first time in our history, the rice shortage did not drive us into panic, but became instead the occasion for moral resurgence on the part of our people. We looked on it as an economic problem and not as apolitical problem. We matched the crisis with resolution.\r\nAnd, with the barangay serving as the network of rice distribution through\u00adout the country, we weathered the crisis and today face with optimism the coming harvest.\r\nIt has been possible to pursue this broad program of social, political, and economic reforms because we retrieved the government bureaucracy from inutility and made it the servant of our development effort.\r\nWe began the journey of the last 12 months with massive overhaul of the government bureaucracy, as proposed in the Reorganization Plan that I submitted to the Congress as early as March 1972. Every letter and provision of the plan has since been implemented, and in those instances where it did not provide for new necessities, we did not hesitate to establish the machinery to answer them.\r\nAs the first step, we faced the massive problem of graft and corruption in the bureaucracy that had been for so long the nemesis of every development program. After a review of ranks of the service, we dismissed and retired over 6,655 employees from the government service. No agency or department was spared from this overhaul, but the most severely affected offices were predictably enough the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Customs, the now-defunct Rice and Corn Administration, and the judiciary.\r\nFollowing this house cleaning, we implemented changes and modifications designed to make the executive branch more relevant and responsive to national needs and goals, particularly the goal of accelerated national development.\r\nWe merged the various economic planning agencies of government into one central body: the National Economic Development Authority that was charged with the task of formulating and overseeing the national economic development program.\r\nWe created the rational Grains Minority to replace the Rice and Corn Administration and attend to the country\u2019s staple food.\r\nWe launched a major overhaul of the revenue collection agencies of government, and provided for a more efficient lax collection system that offered, in part, an amnesty to individuals and corporations with accountability with the government. The immediate result of this has been a new record in tax collections.\r\nAt the level of every department and agency, we have implemented reorganization plans designed to make them more effective and economical units of the bureaucracy.\r\nFinally, at the level of the local governments, we have created the new Department of Local Governments and Community Development to bring new vitality to all the local governments of the country.\r\nThe net result of this reorganization effort is a government that can provide services in the field where they count most that spends less for political representatives, and more for the benefits of the people, and leads in the realization of national objectives.\r\nAs of the first of September, the cash operations of the national government netted a surplus of P1.202 billion.\r\nThe priority we have given to Mindanao in our integrated development approach was dictated in part by the immense resources of that area that had to be tapped, in part, by an old social question that has nagged me since I first came to the Presidency.\r\nWe have never really bridged the cultural gap between the majority of the Filipinos and our Muslim brothers, and it is for us now to really bridge it. The troubles that broke out last October, fanned by Communist agitation and propaganda, did not precede our plans for the area: They delayed rather than hastened the implementation of our projects.\r\nThe Muslim areas have a lot of catching up to do with the more developed parts of the country, and in this we were committed to give them all possible support.\r\nThat is why new road arteries are being built simultaneously in the area; food production, education, and health services are being given utmost emphasis; and economic activity is being given a big push. P496 million have been appropriated for Mindanao, apart from the funds coming from foreign loans for development. A Muslim information center has been opened in Marawi, the Institution of Islamic Studies in the University of the Philippines, Amanah Bank has been created with a capitalization of P100 million; barter trade has been resumed with Sabah; and a unique type of development loan is being given to those who had fled to the hills but later opted to live a normal life.\r\nOur relations with our neighbors and the outside world have been marked with civility and friendship, with a deepened understanding on the part of our allies of the new decisions we have had to take in pursuance of the society we are trying to build.\r\nOur reforms have won the respect and confidence even of those who were skeptical about the prospects of our success immediately after September last year. We have won new friends without losing any of our old ones. We continue to maintain a strong presence in the ASEAN and other forums of importance.\r\nWe have forged new ties with Eastern Europe, strengthened existing ties with the Islamic nations of Africa and the Middle East, as well as the non-Islamic ones. Only a few weeks ago, we sat down in friendly consultation with dignitaries from Libya, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Somalia on how the Islamic nations can help in our effort to lift up the Muslim areas.\r\nAt the root of all these is a new sense of vitality and discipline, a new sense of pride that has taken hold of our people. Here at last is a people who will obey the law not because they fear punishment but rather because they know that by supporting order and government, they are building with their own hands the future that they want. It makes one proud to be one of them, and to see what they have become.\r\nMany will ask, what do you consider your worthiest accomplishment during the last 12 months? My answer is: the transformation of our people. It is this reaching out to one another, to do something \u201dextra\u201d for the country and for one\u2019s fellowmen. It is here that our democratic revolution inscribes its greatest virtue, its most important gain. For it is that makes an age, a culture, a civilization.\r\nThe sheer momentum of our reforms so far has thrust our country forward on its journey towards full national development. But, compared to the long way we still have to go, we have taken only a few steps.\r\nAnd we cannot afford to linger on the road. If we do, we risk being overtaken by a reassertion of old habits, a relapse into complacency and indolence.\r\nThen also, development generates its own dynamism. Our very gains have created new problems, vastly more complex than the ones we have surmounted.\r\nBasically, what we have done these past 12 months has been to lay the foundations of national civility that have been torn up by decades of bitter political strife and social anarchy. We have redressed the most urgent popular grievances. We have established a pattern of social, political, and economic stability. From this new level of stability, we must now launch our nation towards a new height of development.\r\nSpecifically, we must consolidate the gains we have made in peace and order.\r\nWe must vigorously check any backsliding on the part of the civil service and the national bureaucracy.\r\nWe must complete the land reform program that we have begun.\r\nWe must propel the national economy to new feats of productivity.\r\nWe must democratize wealth, and make labor a full partner in development.\r\nWe must broaden the social services, particularly in housing and education.\r\nWe must broaden our political economic and cultural relationships in the world community.\r\nThe tremendous improvement in peace and security is self-evident to every citizen and every visitor to the Philippines; Manila has at last been able to shed its international notoriety as a city of guns and mindless violence.\r\nThe Filipino is safer now, in his person and property, than he has been in a generation.\r\nYet you and I know that there are gaps, lacks, and remission in this atmosphere of security.\r\nPetty crime appears to be rearing its ugly head once again in Metropolitan Manila, and I am aware that there is a resurgence of petty graft among the lower echelons of local and national governments.\r\nWe cannot\u2014we shall not\u2014condone this kind of backsliding. Neither has insurgency completely subsided. In some parts of the southern islands, in Northern Luzon and Bicolandia, there is still occasional righting between our troops and rebellious bands. Although the government has broadened its effort to develop the Muslim regions through a broad-based, integrated program of economic and social development, and our negotiations with leaders of the disaffected communities have been productive.\r\nThere have been recent ambuscades in Cotabato, Lanao, and Zamboanga; and outlaw bands still roam portions of Basilan Island.\r\nIn Jones, Isabela, the government recently lost some men in encounters with Communist terrorists.\r\nWe expect some more incidents of this kind to occur in the South and in the North. But such incidents are bound to be limited in scale and peripheral in significance.\r\nIt is clear that dissidence has no future in this country, and we shall not let these incidents distract us from our real work.\r\nWe shall continue to meet insurgency and subversion with the full force of state power, as we have done. But we shall also remain eager to negotiate, to conciliate the grievances of those among us who are disaffected, who feel left behind by the level of living that others of us have attained. We shall extend the government\u2019s hand, in friendship and respect, to all those who desire it. And the state shall continue to make its primary concern the task of spreading the benefits of development equitably among all our people. It shall be my policy to unite the nation and bring together all diverse and conflicting elements.\r\nThe cornerstone of this policy is the land reform program. This has touched the lives of many Filipino workers on the land. But the implementation of the program has been hampered by a lack of funds, by resistance from vested interests, and by administrative deficiencies. In some cases landowners, in the ways of the old society, are once again trying to use their \u201cconnections\u201d to preserve their landholdings.\r\nOn the problem of food production, the next harvest should enable us to more than meet our minimum domestic requirements in rice and other food crops. Masagana 99 and Palayan ng Bayan are doing their part\u2014the one to improve agricultural technology, the other to harness all idle government lands to the needs of food production.\r\nBut our efforts here are grievously hampered by a perennial shortage of fertilizer, farm machinery, even of farm animals. We must find a way of overcoming these deficiencies.\r\nIn the last 12 months, we have started to shift the thrust of the economy from imports to exports. In this effort, we have had initial success\u2014which is reflected in the favorable balance of trade, the unprecedented level of our foreign reserves, and in the influx of foreign investment. Our exports increased by 57%, 27% of which are new products. But here too we have a great deal more to do, and many complex problems to face.\r\nOur basic strategy is to balance the optimum growth in national product\u2014utilizing both national and foreign capitals to the fullest extent\u2014with the largest-possible expansion of employment. Towards this end, we are paying particular attention to the encouragement of small- and medium-scale industries, which are characteristically labor-intensive.\r\nWe do not intend to neglect our youth in this generative process. Our out-of-school youth, particularly, must become committed to development: They too must share in the proceeds.\r\nWe must now undertake a survey of youth resources: how many of them are productive, how many unproductive.\r\nPart of this enlistment of our youth in the developmental process is the reform of the educational system that we have initiated, to transform our schools from sterile ivory towers into vital centers of modernization. While doing so, we shall preserve and enhance academic freedom: Our universities will keep their autonomy, and will continue to take care of their own problems of student dissidence.\r\nDespite the lessons of the past, there still is a tendency among some of the affluent and economically powerful in our society to amass wealth indiscriminately and to corner scarce commodities. The government has no desire to create new oligarchies in place of the old: We shall take every opportunity to encourage the rich in the fulfillment of their civil responsibility.\r\nTo whom much is given, much will be expected by the New Society. We shall propose to national business and industry the creation of a social ameliora\u00adtion fund that will encompass housing, education, medical, and pension plans for their workers.\r\nThis acceptance by the rich of their social responsibility must include their willingness to democratize the crucial sectors of the economy. We shall urge corporations engaged in the public utilities and the exploitation of natural resources to broaden their ownership.\r\nIn this way can Philippine capital make Philippine labor a partner, instead of an inanimate tool, in the process of production. We cannot allow progress to be built on the back of the Filipino worker, nor allow the minimum-wage worker to be squeezed between the threat of unemployment and an escalating cost of living. The government shall see to it that the worker is awarded his just share of every increment of rising productivity.\r\nThis government concern for the Filipino worker cannot but extend to the military, whose scale of salaries is very much lower than that of the private sector. I am, under my own personal direction, organizing a fund intended for those who serve in the Armed Forces. This fund must be organized in partner\u00adship with the private sector and must take care of the housing, educational, medical needs, as well as the future of military personnel and their dependents.\r\nAs an earnest of our determination to develop the economy, we have in the past year drawn up a variety of incentives for business and investment. We shall continue this policy. The tax on dividends declared by corporations shall be reduced from the present 35% to 15%.\r\nWe shall continue to protect foreign investors from harassment, confisca\u00adtion, or expropriation. The government regard them as partners in Philippine progress and solemnly guarantees the free repatriation of their investments and their profits at any time.\r\nIn government, we shall continue to give priority to development. Forty-five percent of the national budget, instead of the usual 15, is now devoted to capital spending.\r\nFaced with a worldwide problem of energy, we are determined to reduce our national dependence on oil to 25% of all our fuel needs. As part of this effort, we are initiating the organization of a mass-transit system for the Metro\u00adpolitan Manila area\u2014transport being the biggest consumer of oil. We shall direct the shifting of needs for energy to geothermal, hydroelectric, and atomic sources of power.\r\nAs the emphasis of our economy changes, so must change national patterns of settlement. We must mitigate the inevitable problems of rapid urbanization\u2014slums, traffic congestion, crime, and so forth\u2014as much as possible. Towards this end, I have ordered the creation of a Human Settlements Commission to oversee the establishment of satellite towns and cities distinct from the Metropolitan Manila region, and to study the implications of changing population patterns and new modes of social organization.\r\nThe broadening of social services continues. And here, the main effort must be the generation of employment, the alleviation of mass poverty and the extirpation of social inequality.\r\nIn foreign relations, we need to broaden our contacts in a time of shifting power relationships in the world community. Towards this end, we have offered relations with Eastern Europe. We have also expanded our contacts with the Middle East and Africa. We are sending an ambassador to Saudi Arabia. A special mission will soon leave for the Middle East. And some of our ambassadors are being concurrently designated to the countries in Africa.\r\nConversely, we have been receiving foreign missions in Manila: A Russian trade mission has just arrived in Manila; and recently we sent a Philippine mission to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\r\nWe have recently acceded to GATT, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. We are participating in the World Conference on Sugar in Geneva, where we hope to obtain a larger share of the sugar quota for the world market. We are negotiating with the European Economic Community through our regional organization, the ASEAN.\r\nOur economic performance in the past 12 months has raised our credit rating at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As a result, we have been able to ease our debt-servicing burden and to generate more development capital through foreign loans.\r\nOur diplomacy is turning towards the Asian region, as it should. Our primary area of interest is productive Philippine participation in ASEAN and the creation of an Asian Forum as a meeting place of the diverse ideologies, cultures, religions, political orders, and national interests of the Asian national states, which must share a common interest in peace and prosperity in the region.\r\nThe agenda before us is full. Hard work awaits us. But the future we face is bright, for national development is within our grasp.\r\nIn a memorable metaphor, the historian Toynbee compared human societies to climbers on a cliff. Some have found poor niches in the rock\u2014and are content to rest where they are: static, petrified, unwilling to venture any higher.\r\nBy contrast, the dynamic societies disdain the mean shelter of the rockface: they aspire to the heights, and willingly risk the danger of a fall for the glory of the summit.\r\nIn many ways, this metaphor sums up the state of the Filipino nation today.\r\nWe have dared to make new beginnings\u2014because the old paths have proved to be dead ends. We have exchanged the poor certainty of the status quo for the dynamism of a new society.\r\nNow we must move from where we are\u2014to new heights.", "title": "Report to the Nation after One Year of Martial Law"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 25, 1971]\r\nOnce again I come to this Congress to report on the state of the nation.\r\nI have come to you through the streets of Manila where a great number of our people are lined up, not in destructive violence, not in arrogance nor in boorishness, but in quiet appeal to the leaders of the nation. Thousands are outside this hall. They are our people. They demand to be heard\u2014indecorum and in sobriety. They cry for change\u2014peacefully. They mount a revolution, but not with arms. They demand a revolution in the tradition of our democracy. They fight a democratic revolution.\r\nThey have asked me to come to speak to you today, now, before it is too late, about their dreams and aspirations.\r\nSo I come to speak of a society that is sick, so sick that it must either be cured and cured now or buried in a deluge of reforms.\r\nWe, who lead this nation, must now recognize the roots of our disappointments. We are a developing nation in a world divided between rich and poor. And all our dreams and sacrifices have been mocked by a system which permits the few to exercise irresponsible power over the many.\r\nIf this observation of our society be true\u2014and I believe it is true\u2014we can no longer achieve so much merely to survive. This brutal pattern in which time and circumstance make a mockery of our heroic efforts must now be broken. For survival is no longer enough for our people. They want\u2014and they deserve\u2014more.\r\nWe live, work, and die in a democratic political system corrupted by a social and economic order that is best described as oligarchic. When economic power, driven only by the pursuit of gain, encroaches on political power\u2014the power of the people because it is accountable to the people\u2014then we have a system that permits the rule by the few for the few.\r\nFor too long has political power virtually been the handmaiden of economic power.\r\nWe talked with the people gathered outside this hall. They demand the eradication of the iniquities of our society. They seek the restructuring of the social order and they will not accept posturings or pious protestations.\r\nYes, in the past we encouraged investment, and in the future we shall continue to do likewise. We shall give incentives to the exploitation of natural resources. We must develop both agriculture and industry. This we have done in accordance with the program of social and economic development.\r\nWhen the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d prove to be insatiable, when they use the combination of media and economic power to coerce and intimidate the duly elected leaders of the people and to advance their privileges and financial gains, there is no course left but to eradicate them.\r\nIt may be the duty of a democratic President to reconcile the few who are rich with the many who are poor. But if the oligarchs would be adamant and block the progress of the many, I shall gladly break with the few, no matter how powerful and wealthy they might be, to fight for the many.\r\nIf all our leaders, past and present, must stand accused before the people, let it be so. But we in the present leadership cannot shirk our responsibility. The time has come to redress the balance on the side of the people. We lead in a time of peril\u2014but of rare opportunity.\r\nWe must act\r\nwe must change\u2014now.\r\nI submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of this Congress, this new orientation of leadership. In exposing to you the oligarchic element in our free society, I ask for no punitive measures, but a rectification of a social and economic order that has prejudiced popular hopes and expectations. Punitive measures will only hurt the few without helping the many. We shall move, ladies and gentlemen, to harmonize\u2014and not to alienate\u2014the classes of our society; but this can only be achieved by ending privilege and the exercise of irresponsible power.\r\nThe illness of our society is aggravated by agitators who would make us so enamored of equality that we would prefer to be equal in slavery rather than unequal in freedom. But despite the demagogues and charlatans, the social unrest is so immensely real that nothing less than the restructuring of the social order is imperative beginning this year.\r\nFor the oligarchy is not impressed by social unrest; it uses it instead to manipulate power and influence. While this government has the means to check the oligarchs, only new laws can guarantee that they will never again impose their will on a free people.\r\nThis leadership is not under any illusion that such an objective is easily achieved. It may take generations to do so. But we must start now. Frictions will arise. But I am determined that these frictions will not divide the nation into hostile camps.\r\nIt is imperative, therefore, that we unite in a common endeavor. Neither shouting in the streets nor inflammatory rhetoric can solve our problems. Let us speak softly, if insistently, so that we may hear and speak to one another. Those who will destroy us will keep on shouting; they will intensify the agitation; but we who have a stake in freedom\u2014in our democratic system\u2014have an obligation to reason together, to work together, in the spirit of unity.\r\nThe year 1970 was marked by three developments or series of events. The first were the steps taken to maintain monetary stability, which culminated with the discarding of the old legal foreign rates of exchange and the adoption of a floating rate. The second was the new militancy of almost all elements of our society in registering their protest against existing evils of the social order and demanding reforms. The third was a series of natural calamities which resulted in damage of about P614 million, without taking into consideration the expected income out of the capital investments that were destroyed.\r\nThis series of events limited and guided governmental policy, as well as its implementation in the year 1970, and will continue to do so not only in 1971 but also in the years to come.\r\nTowards a democratic revolution, which alone can forge a strong and enduring unity of our nation, I propose that we think and act boldly but with maturity in 1971.\r\nFor the year 1971 is the year of reorientation to a true democratic revolution.\r\nIt is the year for the reorientation of our foreign policy.\r\nAnd it is the year for the reorientation of domestic policy to restructure the social order.\r\nWe must reorient foreign policy to gain new friends while we strengthen the ties with our old ones.\r\nWe must reorient domestic policy so we may return dignity and power to the people\u2014the peasant, the laborer, the employee, and worker\u2014without wrecking the gains of investment. This needs more statesmanship than the first.\r\nFor too long have we used Western methods for our Asian problems. Now we must adopt a Filipino or Asian approach to them.\r\nWhen we speak of employment, we speak in alien terms of the huge factories and manufacturing centers. Now let us talk of the Asian way of small family-level manufacturers or producers with a central management, financing, marketing, and direction.\r\nWe must now change gears in the economic vehicle. The year 1970 was a year of consolidation and stabilization. Although we continue to pursue these efforts, we must now not only consolidate or stabilize but pick up speed and move forward. Undoubtedly, 1970 was a difficult year both for capital and labor. But we moved forward.\r\nNow let us push this momentum of progress further.\r\nIn further extending additional credit while attending to more consolidation and stabilization effort, we must continue to move towards the dream of a balanced agro-industrial economy.\r\nIn short, we can look forward to some relaxation of credit. Both the public and private sectors will have more money to spend this year.\r\nHowever, the primary policy change will be a redirection towards more productive undertaking. Historians will probably give this redirection more importance than other policies of government.\r\nIn some industries like cement, on which the total exposure of government is about P900 million, there has been delinquency in the payments of amortization and indebtedness to some government institutions like the Development Bank of the Philippines, notwithstanding the existence of huge inventories of stockpiled production which cannot be sold in the open market. In order to give a push to economic activity in this area, we have instituted a linkage arrangement under which these debtor corporations can offset their indebtedness to DBP by delivering goods for public projects. Under this system, the debtor corporations pay the Development Bank of the Philippines in goods which they cannot sell. These goods, for example, cement, are then utilized by government for projects that have been stalled by the lack of supplies and funds.\r\nThe experiment seems to have succeeded, and it is my intention that we pursue this ingenious method of breaking the vicious cycle of overproduction, huge inventories, and scarcity of funds of debtor corporations.\r\nAs a result of the 20 typhoons that visited our country in 1970, especially Typhoon Yuling\u2019 and Typhoon Sening,\u2019 there has been a marked increase of prices, even of domestic commodities like eggs, vegetables, and poultry. I have ordered immediate implementation of the Agricultural Recovery Program and released P35 million for it.\r\nAs part of the crusade against oppressive monopolies and combinations, it is my hope to stabilize rates and prices in public utilities.\r\nThe typhoons, especially Typhoon Yuling and Typhoon Sening, have wiped out 10% of our coconut plantations. We will lose a corresponding amount in our coconut export and dollar earnings. We must now recover this through the other industries, such as mining, etc. Accordingly, we will encourage and support the development of the mining industry, including oil exploration.\r\nPart of the cause of the tensions that grip our country is the fear of unemployment. As I have said before on the use of Asian methods to solve Asian problems, we will now mobilize on a nationwide basis, both in the rural and the urban areas, the Filipino method of dispersed family producers with a central management, financing, and marketing direction.\r\nThis should be so massive that it will reach every home wherein there are idle hands.\r\nThe NACIDA and private sector operators will be the principal instrument of this massive, self-employment scheme.\r\nOne of the principal problems of production is the inadequacy of power. Only 6% of our people in the provinces have electricity; 14 out of 15 families live in darkness. We have initiated a cheap rural electrification program that must ultimately reach every comer of the country. For this program we will spend P600 million. The sources of funds for this program are reparations from Japan, U.S. Public Law 480, under USAID, and other sources of foreign financing. It is our hope that such machinery and equipment as can be produced locally can now be manufactured by Filipinos.\r\nStarting this year, we shall fully mobilize the potential of cottage industries for employment generation. To make these humble industries more economic and efficient, they should increasingly utilize centralized management, assembly, financing, and marketing. The NACIDA and the National Manpower and Youth Council shall collaborate in this field.\r\nI urge the immediate establishment of a State Trading Corporation to stabilize the prices of prime commodities within the reach of the masses by eliminating the middlemen.\r\nI propose the establishment of a National Economic Development Authority to provide effective overall direction to the economy.\r\nOne of the principal reasons for the dramatic progress achieved by other countries, such as Japan and Germany, is the availability of highly skilled and educated manpower. The educational system in our country shall therefore now be reoriented to turn out graduates on the secondary and collegiate levels who are capable of meeting our requirements in industrialization and economic progress.\r\nAs I promised representatives of organized labor recently, I have set in motion decisive steps to regulate monopolies and curb monopoly practices. I therefore recommend the approval of antitrust legislation. I have also ordered a review of franchises and titles now being used to justify monopolistic practices which lead to heavier price burdens upon the poor. Moreover, I propose to make compliance with labor laws a precondition to the grant of loans by the government\u2019s financial institutions.\r\nI propose a land policy which will compel all landowners to develop their lands or forfeit all or portions of their lands for distribution to actual occupants. To this end, I also propose the revocation or cancellation of all titles and awards over big idle lands\u2014if necessary, through an amendment to the Constitution.\r\nI urge the establishment of a nationwide system of cooperative fanning under which lands acquired under the Land Reform Program shall be organized into large-scale farms owned communally or jointly by actual farmer-occupants.\r\nI propose to launch a massive land distribution drive aimed at satisfying the hunger for land of our small settlers and members of the cultural minorities.\r\nIn the distribution or redistribution of public land in the future, we should give priority to the underprivileged workers, including migrant laborers\u2014the \u201csacadas.\u201d We should resist and stop the tendency to reproduce in public land areas the regressive and wasteful land tenure of traditional society. Our public land policy must be pegged to the goal of a broadly based, democratic land ownership.\r\nI call for the imposition of a tax on affluent consumption. This shall include a progressive tax on luxury houses, cars, and other symbols of conspicuous consumption.\r\nI propose a radical increase in inheritance tax to stop the perpetuation of unearned wealth in the hands of a few.\r\nI propose a ban on the importation of luxury goods in order to conserve foreign exchange for development purposes.\r\nI urge the creation of a national commission which shall supervise and regulate the importation of crude oil and the production and marketing of gasoline and other oil products in the national interest.\r\nI call for a redirection of our public housing policy so that it will serve, above all, the working people. I urge the establishment of a national housing authority which shall undertake massive low-cost housing projects, resettle and rehabilitate squatter families, and assist in urban planning. The P150 million spent for housing loans by the SSS and an almost equal amount by the GSIS should now be spent for this purpose. I now propose that these amounts be rediverted to truly low-cost housing for laborers and employees. This will further give an impetus to economic activity.\r\nI propose the creation of a fund for the Population Commission established in 1969 under an executive order to cope with the problems of population explosion.\r\nIn foreign affairs, the opening of trade and diplomatic relations with the USSR and with other Soviet bloc countries is only a matter of time. On the other hand, we are now engaged in a review of our relations with the United States of America to make them serve more fully the mutual interests of the two countries. This does not mean, however, that we have abandoned our fight against subversive communism inside our country. It is the principal enemy that slowly saps the vitality of our nation.\r\nI propose the adoption of the recommendations of the Commission on Government Reorganization designed to restructure the administrative machinery of government and relate it to the urgent goals of development.\r\nI propose to make permanent certain electoral reforms which were successfully tried in the last election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention.\r\nI reiterate our policy of disbanding unlawful private armies which constitute a menace to the freedom and peace of mind of the citizenry.\r\nWe started 1970 by adopting the free exchange rate.\r\nThis was dictated by the fact that we had begun to overtax our resources. As a people, we wanted to have the best of both worlds. We wanted to have development and to consume immediately its fruits. We imported too heavily, and the rich among us spent profligately out of the total foreign exchange capabilities of the country. The limit was reached in 1970. In February, a drastic decision had to be made to stabilize our economic position before it was further imperiled.\r\nIt was inevitable that the free exchange rate would be followed by an increase in prices. But this is a small, and temporary, sacrifice compared to the benefits that the economy has gained in just a year.\r\nIn spite of the economic difficulties faced by the economy in 1970, the country\u2019s physical output of goods and services measured by the gross national product (GNP) valued in constant 1955 price continued to expand, although at a slower rate of 4.4% compared to the annual report.\r\nViewed against the Four-Year Development Plan target for Fiscal Year 1970, GNP at constant FY 1967 prices when converted to comparable fiscal year basis showed a growth rate of 5.2% as against the 5.0% called for in the plan. The GNP at constant FY 1967 prices actually reached level of P29,232 million in FY 1970, P60 million more than the target level of P29,172 million.\r\nWe reduced imports by 6% and expanded exports by 21%; we cut our deficit on foreign trade payments from $263.8 million in 1969 to minimal $24.7 million in 1970. On the total foreign exchange payments, we were able to move from a net deficit of $67.7 million in 1969 to a surplus position of $110.7 million.\r\nThe net deficits of these magnitudes, of course, are a considerable increase of our total foreign exchange reserve position. Exclusive of Central Bank net borrowings of $83.5 million, the surplus for the year reached $27.2 million. The large government deficit for 1969, which had been necessitated by the requirements of our capital program, was turned into a cash surplus of P56 million for 1970. This was made possible by drastic expenditure cutbacks and new taxes.\r\nOur tax performance for the year is a record that must be stressed, principally because of the passage of the export tax on principal traditional exports. In previous years, the average tax effort measured as a percent of our gross national product (GNP) has been in the order of 10 to 11% of the GNP. Anticipating the collections from the export tax by the end of the current fiscal year, we will raise the tax effort to 15% of the GNP, an impressive rate when compared to other countries. This, I must say, is an accomplishment that is to be shared with Congress.\r\nYet, in view of the disappearance of the export tax by 1974, this tax effort ratio will return to normal levels, thus necessitating a forward look into tax reform. For how else can we expect to finance the bulk of our development efforts with price stability if we do not raise the total tax effort permanently?\r\nThe year 1970 was therefore a year of consolidation. What have we to show for it?\r\nWe have climbed back from an extremely low point in the foreign exchange situation to a new plateau. At the end of 1970, our foreign exchange reserve reached $236.6 million compared to $125.9 million at the end of 1969, an increase of $110.7 million. This upward trend will continue. Our fiscal position, internally, is robust and strong as a result of living resolutely within our means, combining fiscal restraint with clear priorities, frugality, with efficiency.\r\nThe unprecedented damage caused by a series of natural disasters made the policy of consolidation even more necessary and urgent. Last year, 20 tropical cyclones visited the Philippines. The damage they wrought on public and private facilities, on farms, and on factories was estimated at P614.5 million. It is difficult at this point to predict accurately the effect of these calamities on our future economic performance. The damage to agriculture was estimated at P306.6 million and on manufacturing at P145.1 million. These disasters are therefore long shadows that dim the horizon of our economic future.\r\nNevertheless, the momentum of our advance, especially in agriculture, was so great that not even the series of typhoons and floods could set back our self-sufficiency in rice. You will doubtless recall that, following smaller calamities, other administrations would utilize large amounts of our foreign exchange earnings to finance the importation of rice. There would be long queues of people before rice stalls throughout the country. Fortunately, our agricultural policy was built so soundly, and the results were so successful that today, in the face of unforeseen disasters, we are not importing, and shall not import, rice at all. The rice revolution has been permanently won.\r\n1970 is therefore also memorable as the year when the nation refused to knuckle down even under the weight of disasters whose total destructive power has no equal in our history.\r\nIn 1970, moreover, activism gathered unprecedented force among our people, notably among the youth. The disorder and violence that characterized not a few of the demonstrations which marked the growth of this activism have naturally compounded the problems and anxieties of the past year. Even so, my administration viewed the new militancy of our people not as an obstacle but as a catalyst of progress, and I have consequently encouraged peaceful demonstrations and similar expressions of honest dissent.\r\nThe year 1970 tested the competence of government to withstand crisis. I think we passed the test with honor and courage.\r\nAs I have said, we began the past year under heavy constraints obtaining from the balance of payments problem. The administration found it imperative, as the only means of solving this problem, to break away from the old export-import pattern. Accordingly, we sought early in the year to reorient the economy to exports and thereby bring an end to the vicious cycle of increasing imports and decreasing exports. This we did by allowing the peso to seek its own level in relation to the dollar.\r\nThe introduction of the \u201cfloating rate\u201d in February 1970 definitely favored the growth of exports in the succeeding months. Total exports increased by 11.1% from $839 million in FY 1969 to $932 million in FY 1970. But to indicate the fuller effects of this exchange rate reform, our exports for the year 1970 over 1969 expanded by 21% to a record level of $1,015 million.\r\nImports, on the other hand, fell from $1,169 million to $1,104 in FY 1970, or a decrease of 5.5%. Relative to plan estimates, exports for 1970 were lower by only 0.3% while imports were higher by 0.8%. At the end of 1970, imports were $1,039.5 million, some $65 million less than the 1969 level.\r\nAs originally designed, the floating exchange rate system effected significant adjustments in the levels of production and investment than otherwise could have been possible under full-blown import and exchange controls. In the long run, the adjustments brought about by the exchange rate reform constitute a necessary step in realizing all the major incentive forces that propel our economy.\r\nThe Central Bank foreign currency deposit plan, inaugurated on August 1, 1970, under Circular No. 304, elicited $34 million in deposits by year-end.\r\nOverall repayments on principal on Philippine external debt totaled $514 million; Central Bank, plus drawing from IMF\u2014$124 million; private sector\u2014$274 million; and government\u2014$116 million\u2014equivalent to 28% of our total foreign exchange receipts. Indeed this level of debt servicing would not have been possible had it not been for the accelerated recovery experienced by the economy in the external payments position.\r\nHowever, the country, despite massive repayments on public and private external debt, operated within its own resources for the first time in four years.\r\nDuring the last year of the first Four-Year Development Program, notwithstanding the fact that we exceeded its most important targets, it became clear that massive foreign support was necessary if the momentum we had gained was to continue.\r\nConsequently, we turned to our traditional partners for this support, but we were told that we had been too ambitious.\r\nAs part of the consolidation effort that I have just spoken of, we sought, through preliminary talks in Paris in October last year, foreign assistance in underwriting part of the cost of the current development program. Out of these talks, we hope to obtain trade credits under the auspices of the World Bank equivalent to $350 million, on a long-term basis. Under our proposed arrangement with a consultative group of countries, we hope to obtain equipment and supplies for our development program under trade credits; $200 million of the loan will be utilized for the public sector, and $150 million for the private sector.\r\nAs we anticipated, the manufacturing sector slowed down in 1970. From an average of 4.7% annual growth rate during the past three years, the growth was 2%. The decrease in the growth of manufacturing is temporary as it is the net effect of the shifting composition of industrial output brought about by the exchange rate reform.\r\nThis is a direct but temporary result of the decision to float the peso and the attempt to restructure the economy. The floating rate discouraged importation of production materials. The shift in investment from consumer goods to capital goods also contributed to this slump.\r\nThe mining sector, on the other hand, being an export-oriented industry, benefited from these measures. It achieved a record production value of more than P1,800 billion during the year, representing a considerable growth rate of 48.0%. This is approximately 45 percentage points higher than the 1969 production value increments which is a mere 2.23%.\r\nWe are about to launch the preparatory phase of oil exploration in our territory. The concerted efforts of both the government and the private sectors make us optimistic that oil will be struck in the Philippines soon.\r\nThe past year was tight for capital and labor. Natural calamities and an enforced exchange reform added rising prices to our difficulties.\r\nYet, in the face of all this, we managed to exceed our reduced growth target for 1970, and indications are that we shall still closely match our target for 1971.\r\nWith adequate gains achieved in solving the basic balance of payments problem, the relatively smaller foreign debt service burden, the cooperation forged among different government institutions through activation of the Financial and Fiscal Policy Committee and, finally, with the statutory guidelines and safeguards under the Export Tax Law and Republic Act No. 6142, along with the positive inducements under the various investments incentives laws, the outlook for 1971 appears brighter than the prospects that faced the economy at the beginning of 1970.\r\nThe damage of the strong 1970 typhoons on our coconut and abaca crops is substantial and will adversely affect export earnings from our coconut and abaca products this year and the next two years. The bulk of the damage is principally confined to the Bicol region, which suffered the force of the heaviest typhoons. Without improvement of cultivation in other coconut planting regions, the coconut crop damage can shrink output by about 10 to 15% this year.\r\nAn aggravating factor in the export trade picture is the recent decrease in the world price of copper, another one of our major export products.\r\nSeveral factors account, however, for a more optimistic assessment of the export picture in 1971.\r\nFirst is principally the \u201cfloating rate\u201d itself, which assures favorable peso prices for all our traditional and new export products.\r\nSecond is the approval of the First Export Priorities Plan, which gives added impetus to our export development program, emphasizing new products.\r\nThird, while the remarkable export expansion of 1970 was due largely to the favorable incentives of the floating rate to all export sectors with existing export capacity, the actual export response of new industries will become more felt this year.\r\nFourth, damage to permanent crops, like coconuts, can be made up in large part by more modern methods of fertilizer application in Mindanao, which now accounts for a substantial output. Indeed, an agricultural revolution in coconut crops will be partly aided by favorable prices now being enjoyed by coconut farmers.\r\nThus, a changing composition of our exports, making fuller use of our abundant labor resources from industry, land from agriculture, and new minerals from our mountains, is expected in 1971.\r\nTaking into account all factors that would affect the balance of payments\u2014continued supervision over credit and money supply; prudent fiscal policy discipline on imports and foreign exchange disbursements; prospects of expanding the export base; the 1970 typhoons; the drop in copper prices in the world market; the growth targets of the Four-Year Development Plan; and the comparatively lighter debt service burden in 1971\u2014it is reasonable to expect that the country will continue to realize a surplus in its balance of payments this year with a gain ranging from a low of $30 million to a high of $70 million.\r\nThe following problems persist, however, underscoring the need for continued discipline, caution, and dedicated effort:\r\nPhilippine tourism has grown consistently during the last decade. In 1970, the number of tourists was 144,071 or 16.8% more than in 1969. The normal yearly growth is only 12%. With more favorable conditions for international tourism in 1971, the influx of tourists will definitely be larger.\r\nOur tourist receipts amounted to $9.726 million in 1960 and $27.069 million in 1969. In 1970, an increase of 17% over 1969 was registered, making tourism seventh among the country\u2019s top dollar earners.\r\nForeign policy arises directly out of the requirements of national growth security.\r\nThe national interest still is the guiding principle in determining our relations with other countries. Accordingly, for the purpose of widening the opportunities of diversified trade, we must now open our doors to other countries, to the Soviet Union and Socialist countries in Eastern Europe which comprise huge untapped markets for Philippine products. In the past, we hesitated to open trade with these countries due to a lack of comprehensive knowledge as well as the procedures in carrying out trade with these countries.\r\nThe new developments around us forcefully compel us to remember that we do not live in a static universe. On the contrary, we live in a world of dynamic change.\r\nWhile the national interests remain constant, the means for realizing them or for insuring their realization require periodic modification in the light of this condition.\r\nIn consonance with the foregoing, we will begin opening our doors lo other countries. We shall do so with open eyes, watchful of dangers but alert to opportunities which serve me national interest.\r\nIn my view, the most important developments of the past year in Southeast Asia are the following\u2014the decreasing American presence in Asia, the assumption by Japan of a more active economic role in Asia, the fresh diplomatic offensive by the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the intensification of regional cooperation among the smaller powers in Southeast Asia.\r\nVast new forces are at work in Asia today. Although the full implications of the new developments are not yet clear, they bolster our belief that a process of change is under way which will radically alter our traditional view of our part of the world.\r\nAccordingly, the principal aim of Philippine foreign policy in 1971 is to seek an accommodation with reality. Realism will be the hallmark of our foreign policy. The objectives are to augment and to diversify relations with other countries, where we feel that such will promote the national interest; and to seek new friends while strengthening ties with old ones.\r\nA far-reaching review of relations with the United States is being undertaken.\r\nAn old principle which governs relations among mature nations should continue to form the basis of Philippine-American relations\u2014the principle of equality and mutuality.\r\nThe Philippine technical panel will meet with the representatives of the United States for the long-awaited revision of the Bases Agreement. I also expect the formal review to signal the beginning of negotiations, leading to a treaty on economic relations to replace the Laurel-Langley Agreement and in conformity with the enlightened principles of the Charter of Algiers.\r\nAt the same time, we have begun exploring the possibilities of diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union and the Socialist countries of Eastern Europe.\r\nTwo considerations compel us to take these steps. The first is the urgent need to intensify our export outlets. The second is the recognition of the fact that we have, ever since we became an independent country, steadily closed our eyes to the existence of the sixth-of-the-world which is Socialist.\r\nThe Soviet Union and the Socialist countries of Eastern Europe comprise a huge untapped market for Philippine products, as well as an important source of industrial development funds. In the past, we hesitated to open relations with these countries due to lack of comprehensive knowledge of the Socialist market as well as of the procedures of Socialist trade. Studies have now remedied this lack.\r\nJapan\u2019s role in Asia is increasing. A policy of friendship, resulting in mutual benefit, will further enhance the warm relations which exist between the Philippines and Japan.\r\nOur immediate concern is the normalization of economic relations. Pending the signing of a treaty of amity, the Philippines and Japan have negotiated many economic agreements. But the signing of that treaty remains an important objective.\r\nThe rise of regional organizations in Asia is one of the key developments in the area. First of all, I regard regional organizations as a means of achieving the individual national objectives of the members of the organizations. Secondly, successful regional organizations make strong contributions to the political and economic stability of the region.\r\nFor these reasons, I have given the utmost support to the ASPAC and the ASEAN. In particular, I urge today an intensification of the activities of the ASEAN. I look forward to the adoption of the proposal for an ASEAN Development Decade on the model of the worldwide development decade initiated by the United Nations. This would mean a more concentrated effort in reaching the elusive but paramount goal of raising the living standards of the peoples of the region.\r\nI feel also that proposals for an ASEAN payments union should be pushed beyond the agreement-in-principle stage. Similarly, the project for the establishment of trade centers in the capitals of the member-countries should be implemented as soon as possible.\r\nFinally, I touch upon the Philippine participation in the United Nations. Our commitment to the ideals of the world organization is of long standing. We remain committed to those ideals. In proof of this, the Philippine delegation, upon my express instructions, worked for the adoption of three significant resolutions. I regard this triumph as a measure of our constantly enlarging horizon. We are involved in the problems of humanity and must assume our just share of responsibility.\r\nSince 1967, the second year of my first term, I have urged the return of the Sangley Point naval station and its facilities to the Philippine government. This will come about this year. The growing needs of the Philippine Navy required room for expansion. In the future, Sangley Point will serve, among other things, as the headquarters of the Philippine Navy and as a communication and ship repair center.\r\nTo cope with present and anticipated responsibilities, I have directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to undertake a continuing reorganization of both the Home Office and the overseas policies. Revitalized policies require a dynamic career corps.\r\nLast year, we broke the backbone of the Huk or HMB movement in Central Luzon with the capture of Faustino del Mundo alias \u201cCommander Sumulong\u201d and Florentino Salac alias \u201cCommander Fonting\u201d and with the death of Pedro Taruc, HMB chief, during a gun battle with government troops.\r\nSuccesses against the New People\u2019s Army were likewise significant. We captured several top-ranking NPA commanders and forced that organization to go into further hiding. Our latest intelligence reports indicate a major dissension within its ranks arising from some failures of its leadership.\r\nThe Armed Forces likewise stepped up its drive last year against smuggling, carnapping, loose firearms, and general criminality. Total value of contraband cigarettes confiscated by the PC, Philippine Navy, and other commands totaled more than P7 million. Four hundred twenty-four stolen vehicles were discovered, while 175 carnapping cases were solved. A total of 2,839 loose firearms were collected. The Philippine Constabulary solved or filed in court about 4,580 cases.\r\nThe military excelled, too, in civic action and disaster control operations. Among the Armed Forces\u2019 outstanding civic activities were those in health and sanitation, manpower training, infrastructure, resettlement programs, and food production. In the wake of destructive typhoons like typhoons Sening and Yuling, prompt rehabilitation was made possible by the speedy relief and rescue operations of the military in cooperation with civilian agencies.\r\nAs for the loyalty of the Army, I have never doubted the fidelity of the Armed Forces to their nation and to constituted authority. The Army will continue to be a steadfast ally in our march towards fulfillment.\r\nPhilippine education must increasingly become an effective instrument of national development.\r\nWithin the context of our fast-changing society, many traditional social values are being replaced as a result of modernization. Cultural patterns are being questioned, and the great masses of people are impatient to acquire for themselves the finer things of life afforded by scientific and technological innovation.\r\nI am convinced that our educational system must be relevant and responsive to the changing times. Every Filipino must be given the opportunity to acquire basic skills, qualities, and attitudes that would enable him to contribute to the improvement of our society.\r\nTotal enrolment this school year is at an all-time high of 10.2 million pupils and students. More than one out of every four Filipinos are in school, and our enrolment ratio in higher education remains the second highest in the world (1,500 per 100,000 population), exceeded only by the United States.\r\nAt this rate, the nation will have to provide 128,700,000 pupil-and-student-years of schooling in the 1970s compared to 73,100,000 pupil-and-student-years in the last decade. To support this huge educational effort, the country will have to spend, by 1975, no less than P2.8 billion annually.\r\nFaced with the prospects of vast expenditures for education, mounting student unrest, and teacher restiveness, and the ever-increasing clamor by the general public for quality and relevance in our educational system, I created last year the Presidential Commission to Survey Philippine Education.\r\nThe commission conducted a thorough study of the following areas: educational administration, educational finance, logistics, higher education, curriculum, manpower development, science education, vocational-technical education, and teacher education.\r\nIts findings confirm the existence of distortions in the manpower output of education, maldistribution of educational facilities among the various regions of the country, weaknesses in standards, and some irrelevance in content. In general, our educational system prepares pupils and students for the next higher grade in the system of training them for a worthwhile role in the national society.\r\nIt is evident that educational planning has been a weakness of our system. There is a lack of clear definition in operational terms of education\u2019s role in national development; the absence of long-range goals; setting performance targets for each operational component of the educational system; the absence of policy guidelines that define the proper function of each educational level or sector; the nature of the decision-making process of both individuals and educational institutions based more on free choice than on guided selection; and the disproportionate magnitude of educational responsibility relative to the economy\u2019s capacity to support the corresponding requirements for educational services.\r\nA comprehensive development plan is therefore badly needed. The objectives of education, in the context of planning requirements, need to be translated in more operational terms. At present, the objectives define a scope of responsibility that is not feasible for the educational system alone to achieve.\r\nPending the completion of this comprehensive development plan for long-term implementation, measures can be taken immediately to achieve some of the needed reforms of our educational system.\r\nI have already issued the appropriate instructions to the Department of Education to revise all curricula in the elementary and secondary schools, in order to make the school experiences of pupils relevant to life in the community and to the needs of social and economic growth.\r\nI have also authorized the design of project plans for long-term programs requiring external low-interest financing.\r\nIt is with abiding concern that I view the educational situation, for I believe that a democratic society can be strong and stable to the degree that its citizens are enlightened and are given the opportunities for occupational, social, and cultural expression. The development of the nation\u2019s human resources is deserving of the highest priority in our scale. Education must continue to deserve the increasing investment of resources for its expansion and strengthening.\r\nFor instance, I propose that free education must eventually extend to high school students. I have decided to commend to Congress, to the Board of Education, and to the Department of Education the need to study how such a proposal can be fulfilled at the earliest possible time.\r\nI view with no less concern the restiveness of our students and other young people. Many of their demands are valid and deserve our attention. I am convinced that our militant student and youth population constitutes a positive force for bringing about radical reforms in our society.\r\nAt this stage of our economic development, the need for middle-level manpower has become imperative. Technological education deserves to be given greater emphasis by providing training programs that are closely related to the needs of our economy. Incentives such as scholarships should be provided for those who have the aptitude for technological education. Accordingly, I am recommending a substantial increase in the funding of the State Scholarship Council.\r\nIn order to remedy the disparity between educational output and the demands of national development, I strongly propose that appropriate reforms at the level of higher education be given due consideration. I urge that there be more intensive efforts to prevent further increase of the educated unemployed as well as to enhance the quality of higher education through professionally designed accreditation schemes.\r\nTo revitalize our higher institutions of learning, I propose to the Constitutional Convention that academic freedom be guaranteed to all universities, public and private.\r\n1970 was a dynamic and fruitful year in the field of labor.\r\nDespite the impact of stabilization measures, like the floating rate and the new minimum wage law, industrial peace remained relatively stable. Only 87 cases out of 1,021 strikeable labor disputes exploded into actual strikes. As the year closed, labor-management relations had largely adjusted to the changes brought about by the floating rate and the new minimum wage law. Barring the rise of new disruptive factors, I expect greater stability in industrial relations this year.\r\nThe Department of Labor helped in the negotiation of 206 collective bargaining agreements providing more than P101 million in additional wages and benefits for more than 41,000 workers all over the country.\r\nOrganized labor achieved new gains. Some 436 new unions embracing 71,000 workers were organized. Agricultural workers and college and university professors represent the biggest segments of this new accretion to organized labor.\r\nThe enforcement of labor and social laws was pursued more vigorously than ever. Through regular and special labor law enforcement drives, the Department of Labor caused the restitution of about P6,000,000 to 19,792 workers, representing underpayment or nonpayment of wages, overtime, and other benefits assured by law to the workers. Most of the beneficiaries are employed in the sugar industry, in the logging industry, and in service and retail establishments.\r\nNew measures were undertaken to protect migrant workers, especially the sacadas in the sugar industry. The Department of Labor now operates regional employment offices in Panay and Negros islands, which closely supervise the activities of labor contractors and the movements of migrant workers. Labor contractors are now required to file cash and surety bonds, of which P281,500 has been filed covering 13,079 sacadas. Our ultimate goal is to eliminate the labor contractors.\r\nMoreover, the labor department policed more closely the recruitment of Filipinos for overseas employment as well as the entry of prearranged employees, resulting in the filing of criminal charges against unscrupulous recruiters.\r\nAlso in line with the policy of maximum protection for the workers, 20,000 workmen\u2019s compensation cases were decided last year, resulting in the payment of P21,209,975 to claimants all over the country.\r\nWe maintained our position as a major voice in Asian labor affairs, and reinforced further our bonds with the International Labor Organization. The ILO area office in Manila, established in late 1969, has been working actively in collaboration with the Department of Labor and the National Manpower and Youth Council.\r\nThe Department of Labor continued to protect 61,000 Filipino workers in U.S. military bases in the Philippines and 16,000 Filipino workers in U.S. military bases in the Philippines and 16,000 Filipino overseas workers in U.S. bases in the Pacific area through active supervision of the two RP-U.S. base labor agreements.\r\nTo offset the adverse effects of the floating rate upon the workers, we have caused the enactment of a new minimum wage law, raising the base pay from P6 to P8 for industrial workers and from P3.50 to P4.75 for agricultural workers. Moreover, the Department of Labor helped our workers in adjusting their wages to the floating rate through free collective bargaining.\r\nTo cope with new price fluctuations and to help hasten industry-wide collective bargaining, I have constituted the Wage Commission envisioned in the new minimum wage law. This commission will adjust minimum wages by industry as the need arises.\r\nOur foreign exchange reserves received a substantial boost with the implementation of the dollar repatriation program. Total receipts under the program during the year 1970 alone reached $163.048 million. This includes the dollar salary remittances of some 16,000 Filipino workers in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, expenditures of the U.S. government in the Philippines, and dollar proceeds of \u201clipsticked\u201d U.S. treasury warrants received by Filipino pensioners.\r\nA significant contribution to this program is the Dollar Deposits Plan under Central Bank Circular No. 304. Total deposits made in authorized agent banks under this plan has reached $39.2 million as of December 28, 1970. Many of the estimated 250,000 Filipinos in the United States, Canada, Hawaii, and other countries were reported as having made substantial contributions.\r\nThe progress of the dollar repatriation program launched in late 1968 may be credited in part to the efforts of a special mission charged with its promotion and implementation, and also to the growing confidence in our banking system of our countrymen in foreign lands.\r\nIn the interest of social justice and industrial peace, I propose the following:\r\nDuring this year, we shall initiate major moves to accelerate low-cost housing for the workers of our country.\r\nCurrent estimates are that the total need for housing ranges from 300,000 to 400,000 units each year, whereas only 15,000 to 30,000 units are being supplied.\r\nIn the Four-Year Development Plan, we have programmed the production of about 13,000 resettlement lots, the construction of over 10,000 dwelling units, and the distribution of about 6,000 urban lots, as well as the construction of about 38,000 units to be financed from the GSIS, SSS, and DBP housing loans. This four-year program will benefit only 67,000 families, which is still short of the estimated urban housing requirement even for only one year. This is so because the program is based on the current capabilities of implementing agencies and the funds usually made available to the housing sectors. It should now be revised.\r\nI have increased this potential by making available about 3,000 hectares of land in Montalban for housing and resettlement capable of accommodating at least 50,000 families. I have also directed the GSIS, the SSS, and the DBP to concentrate their investible funds on mass housing projects for our workers. For this purpose, these agencies are to give priority to the development of government-owned lands so as to keep costs to a minimum.\r\nThere should be a simultaneous effort to attract private capital to invest in housing.\r\nTo this end, I propose to establish a workable secondary mortgage market which would allow private long-term housing mortgage loans without restricting liquidity. Indirect subsidies shall be extended by the government to maintain interest rates at a level within the reach of the low-wage earner. At the same time, this subsidy will allow investors reasonable returns for their investments. These measures shall be supplemented by the establishment of a Housing and Urban Development Fund which I also propose to this Congress. The funds shall be constituted mainly from (1) an employer\u2019s payroll tax subject to a compensating tax credit should the employer invest in company housing: (2) an employee\u2019s refundable assessment; (3) a progressive tax on high-cost dwelling; (4) a special tax on idle urban lands; and (5) a special housing development tax which is merely an extension of the present science tax. These taxes are expected to generate about P170 million in the first year and as much as P350 million by the 10th year.\r\nAs a major part of our employment promotion strategy, we quickened the pace of national manpower and out-of-school youth training in 1970. This was a priority program we launched in 1967 to train and develop human resources, and which we have since transformed into a nationwide program.\r\nFor FY 1969-1970, the National Manpower and Youth Council trained 98,098 unemployed young adults and out-of-school youths in a wide range of occupational skills; 75 to 85% of these graduates have found employment or have become self-employed.\r\nWe have trained 3,874 employed industrial workers under special programs for in-plant training, skills upgrading, supervisor, and trainer training.\r\nWe are now building the NationalManpowerSkillsCenter in Taguig, Rizal, to train vocational instructors and trainers. The center will be operational around the middle of this year. Training tools and equipment for the center, worth $50,000, have been received from the UNDP/ILO.\r\nIn addition to its routine functions, the National Manpower and Youth Council also conducted 15 special projects in conjunction with either private or public agencies. A total of 3,481 trainees have been trained in these special projects.\r\nAt the same time, we conducted surveys on the training needs of both the public and private sectors.\r\nThis year we will modify our accelerated manpower training program. I want the National Manpower and Youth Council to turn out better trained people.\r\nI hereby direct the National Manpower and Youth Council to redesign the accelerated manpower program to make it more relevant and responsive to the needs of industry and the national economy.\r\nTo realize these goals, I propose the strengthening of the council through the creation of regional offices in 13 regions throughout the country to coordinate the activities of training centers and to assist the local manpower youth committees.\r\nI also propose the expansion of the NationalManpowerSkillsCenter to upgrade further the skills of experienced workers in all sectors of industry.\r\nTo make the employment of our trained manpower easier, we shall establish more regional and provincial employment offices this year.\r\nIn my State of the Nation message last year, I said that the prospects for our economic development suffered from an exploding population.\r\nThe problem is still very much with us. But our population planning program has so succeeded that we can look with optimism to the future.\r\nSince the Presidential creation of the Commission on Population in February 1970, the number of family planning clinics has gone up from 240 to 700. The female participants in our family planning program rose from 10,000 to about 350,000.\r\nThe Philippines now has a population of about 37,800,000. We are the 15th largest country in the world in terms of population and seventh largest among developing countries. We contain 1% of the world\u2019s population and 1.8% of that of Asia.\r\nThe Philippine population is now growing at an annual rate of 3%. This implies a doubling of the number of people in less than 22 years. The stresses on the social and economic fiber of the nation will be tremendous. Gigantic efforts to meet the geometrically rising requirements of the masses will have to be made\u2014in the areas of housing, employment, education, food production, medical care, and essential public services. The pace of our development dictates that we adopt a genuine family planning program.\r\nI ask Congress to enact a law setting up a commission on population to place our family planning program on a sustained and permanent basis.\r\nThe administration of justice is not simply a matter of law but also of social behavior. Although legally, all men are equal, the principle of equality is so distorted in reality that we are often appalled by the difference.\r\nIt cannot be denied that no matter how noble in their conception, some of our laws have been perverted in practice so that a few can aggrandize themselves at the expense of the many. I remember the civic-minded couple in Davao del Norte against whom an injunction was issued by a court over a barricade established in their own property and for which they were imprisoned for contempt of writ. The case of Datu Ma Falen is another proof of this perversion of a law. The reservation in which Ma Falen and his people lived had been assimilated into a public land award and therefore the tribe had to fight back. The law was on the side of Ma Falen\u2019s enemies, technically. But in this case, the law was harsh, inhuman, antisocial, and ultimately, divisive of the nation. In the past year, fortunately, we acted just in time to remedy such abuses against several cultural minorities, who, as a result, have been restored to their patrimony as well as to their confidence in the government.\r\nThe law must continue to grow in both flexibility and wisdom. But above all, it must increasingly be attuned to the real needs and aspirations of the masses of the people.\r\nWe achieved a minor reform in the judicial system in 1970 by cutting down the time it takes to finish criminal cases in the courts of first instance to a little more than three months. As a result, the nationwide backlog of cases has been considerably reduced.\r\nThe CFI managed to dispose of criminal cases in record time by holding daily hearings. Additional complements of district state prosecutors were assigned to special courts where the trial of a case, once started, is continuous until termination, with the decision rendered within the requisite 30-day period after submission.\r\nWe have also worked on the speedy disposition of criminal cases involving the taking of human life. We discouraged postponements of hearings while at the same time giving adequate protection consistent with the requirements of due process. It is hoped that this step will reduce the incidence of murder and homicide.\r\nThe Department of Justice in 1970 also launched \u201cOperations Search Warrant\u201d to protect our people from abuse, harassment, or criminal acts by public servants or private persons in the application or issuance of search warrants.\r\nThere was speedier prosecution of cases involving smuggling, carnapping, election protests, and crimes against national security.\r\nInternal reforms were undertaken in the Justice Department and the judiciary. In a precedent-setting action, a judicial supervisor was assigned to prosecute a complaint against a municipal judge. The department also speeded up action on administrative cases against judges and fiscals. A number of district and municipal judges and fiscals were dismissed. The department adopted the policy of denying transfers on promotions to district judges responsible for the heavy backlog in their salas.\r\nIn Congress, a number of \u201cjustice-for-the-poor\u201d bills were enacted. Among these are laws eliminating the need for trial de novo and converting city and municipal courts into courts of record; creating additional new salas in the CFI; giving preference to criminal cases where the parties are indigents; dispensing with the requirements of bail, subject to certain exemptions.\r\nOn the justice front, we also secured the following gains last year: the NBI coordinated with the Bureau of Lands to unearth anomalous payroll and travelling accounts running into millions of pesos, and to charge the culprits; the Public Service Commission gave reasonable relief to distressed public services as a result of increased costs insuring quality of public service; the Code Commission completed the new proposed Penal Code; the Office of Agrarian Counsel succeeded in preventing the ejectment of tenant-farmers in Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Isabela, and Rizal; and the Court of Agrarian Relations achieved a record high in the number of cases handled and disposed.\r\nI propose the enactment of a probation law that will enable our society to take advantage of extramural treatment as a correctional tool. All progressive systems of criminal rehabilitation have provided for a system of probation, and it is time we did the same. I therefore ask Congress to approve House Bill No. 4614 which provides for an adult probation system.\r\nI propose the creation of a maximum security prison for dangerous prisoners in the Bureau of Prisons. A youth institution for offenders from the age of 16 to 21 and a reception and diagnostic center should be established. There is an urgent need to increase the per capita expense on prisoners and to establish regional penal institutions. We should increase the number of prison guards and at the same time establish an institution to house detention prisoners.\r\nIn the Public Service Commission, it is recommended that the PSC have an office in every region for more effective supervision and collection of fees. A field examination unit should be created to examine books of accounts. The PSC should be provided a staff of engineers to determine the value of the property and equipment of public services.\r\nIn the Board of Pardon and Parole, it is recommended that the board have direct supervision over all parolees to do away with the practice of municipal and city judges undertaking such supervision.\r\nIn the Anti-Dummy Board, it is recommended that amendatory legislation be provided for the inclusion of antidummy cases within the jurisdiction of the circuit criminal courts.\r\nI propose the establishment of more branch offices in the Court of Industrial Relations. Additional funds for its operations should also be provided.\r\nWe should also increase the appropriations for the Court of Agrarian Relations. To remedy the lack of competent special attorneys, the Secretary of Justice or the Agrarian Counsel should be given authority to transfer special attorneys in less active areas to districts where their services are direly needed.\r\nIn the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, I propose that the court be equipped with more technical assistants, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage counselors, and social workers.\r\nLast year, the Department of Social Welfare trained out-of-school youths in 31 community centers for leadership and community welfare work; extended direct services to 31,625 youths and students in depressed urban areas; provided emergency relief to 4,500,000 victims of different disasters; implemented the social action program on the barrio level to bring social services to the rural areas; gave assistance to 10,112 national minority families in Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Pampanga, Sulu, and Zambales through community development projects; resettled 13,150 squatter families in government relocation projects in Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan; distributed certified seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, and money to 18,000 families; and provided vocational rehabilitation for some 10,000 disabled men and women including recovered drug addicts, released prisoners, and negative hansenites.\r\nThe allocation and release of adequate funds will enable the Department of Social Welfare to decentralize fully its programs to regions, provinces, municipalities, and barrios so as to bring its services closer to the people in need and to hire additional social workers.\r\nDespite drastic curtailment in resources, our achievements in community development have been outstanding. During 1970, some 87,865 self-help community projects worth P89,626,480 were undertaken by our rural folk themselves. This attests to the new achieving spirit now at work in 26,000 barrios all over the country.\r\nOn the other hand, 1,898 infrastructure projects valued at P11,771,826,000 were finished, benefiting 1,898,000 inhabitants. These projects include feeder roads, public markets, schoolhouses, gymnasia, rural electrification units, and others.\r\nIn the interest of food sufficiency, 942 food production projects were completed valued at P4,965,794 and benefiting 1,000,000 farmers.\r\nIn the field of health and sanitation, 644 community projects worth P6,792,226 were finished. These projects are now serving some 650,000 inhabitants in the rural areas.\r\nTo link our rural masses to the mainstream of ideas and events, we distributed 3,700 transistorized radio sets in our far-flung communities.\r\nWe shall continue the emphasis on community development this year, with special attention to impact-type development projects in our rural areas. The aim is to set the momentum for self-sustaining growth in our 26,000 barrios by mobilizing the creative will and energy of the rural folk themselves.\r\nDuring the last five years, out of a total expenditure of P796 million, we were able to build 20,433 kilometers of roads and construct about 37,167 lineal meters of bridges. During the current year alone, when expenditures for highway projects totaled P147.2 million, some 4,820 kilometers of roads were constructed and improved, and permanent bridges with an aggregate length of 6,636 lineal meters were built.\r\nNext fiscal year, we intend to step up the pace of road construction through the concrete-paving of 386 kilometers and asphalting of 406 kilometers of developmental and feeder roads, and the erection of 7,500 lineal meters of permanent bridges.\r\nThe focal point in next year\u2019s program is the construction of the Philippine-Japan Highway Project stretching from Aparri, Cagayan, to DavaoCity which is covered by a $30-million loan from Japan.\r\nTwo other trunk roads of great economic value to Mindanao are also scheduled to be started next fiscal year; the General Santos-Cotabato and the Digos (Davao)-Cotabato City Road. The Asian Development Bank has recently approved a loan of $10.6 million for the first project, while the second project is now under study by the World Bank.\r\nDuring the last five years, we spent about P27.8 million constructing or improving airports. This year, we have improved 870,000 square meters of runways, taxiways, and aprons in several airports by paving them with concrete or asphalt.\r\nNext fiscal year, we plan to pave 492,000 square meters of airport space and to improve the facilities of the ManilaInternationalAirport to make it adequate for jumbo jets. We also plan to continue the installation of navigational facilities.\r\nNext fiscal year, we shall put emphasis on the second phase of the nationwide telecommunications expansion and improvement project which will extend to other major cities and towns not covered by the backbone network completed in the first phase linking principal cities and towns. Another important project is the expansion of the Government Telephone System.\r\nThis year, we plan to extend the PHILCOMSAT\u2019s capability by building another large disc antenna to permit operation with the satellite not only over the Pacific but also over the Indian Ocean to link our country to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and several other Asian countries.\r\nOur target for the next fiscal year is to put 47,000 hectares of agricultural land under gravity and pump irrigation. The Upper Pampanga River Project, with an authorized loan of $34 million from the World Bank, has been started. When completed, it will provide year-round irrigation to 76,000 hectares in Central Luzon, aside from providing power, fish conservation, and recreation facilities. In Mindanao, preconstruction activities on the ADB-financedCotabatoRiver project are under way. Some 9,430 hectares of land in Cotabato and South Cotabato stand to benefit from the completion of this project which includes a hydropower plant.\r\nIn the last five years, we completed 18 foreign and 78 domestic ships\u2019 berths, reclaimed 58 hectares of port area, built 77,632 square meters of cargo sheds, dredged 38.5 million cubic meters, and constructed 7,500 lineal meters of seawalls. Among the major facilities completed are Piers 3, 15, and the MarginalWharf of the Port, which was financed by a loan from the World Bank.\r\nNext fiscal year, we intend to construct or improve the Port of Manila and at least 43 other national ports as well as 107 marginal ports, including the NavotasFisheriesPort, the ports of Davao, Iligan, and Batangas.\r\nWe feel that to minimize the destructive effects of recurrent floods in the Greater Manila area, a long-range integrated and rational flood control program should be evolved. Such a program was prepared last year. It will involve drainage mains, pumping stations, and related facilities. Flood control works including river walls, revetments, floodgates, and the Marikina division channel, and control facilities will also be undertaken. This long-range program will cost P300 million to be spread out over a 15-year period.\r\nWe have also adopted an interim program to provide for immediate relief to the flood problem in the area, involving primarily the dredging of esteros and repair of river walls, drainage mains, and pumping stations.\r\nTo solve the transportation problem of Greater Manila, we have undertaken a study of the mass transportation system in the area. To relieve the traffic problem and to promote the healthy development of Metropolitan Manila, we propose the creation of a Greater Manila Transport Authority which shall be responsible for the integrated planning and regulation of transport investments and operations in the area.\r\nThe many natural calamities experienced in 1970, particularly Typhoon Yuling, which left Manila in total darkness for several days, brought home to many of us who enjoy the comforts of urban life what 14 out of every 15 families in our rural areas go through in their everyday existence. It is because only 6% of our people in the rural areas have electricity that I have embarked on a new program of electrification that would provide area coverage and ultimately improve the total productivity of the Philippine countryside.\r\nFor this program, we will spend P600 million. We have allocated\r\nreparations program from Japan, peso proceeds from U.S. Public Law 480, and other sources of foreign financing. Having identified this firm investment in rural electrification, as well as the various components that make up a complete electrification system, I call upon our Filipino entrepreneurs to help me sustain this program by manufacturing in the coming years the equipment and material requirements of this program.\r\nI therefore recommend the enactment of bills creating special funds for our programs involving flood control in Greater Manila, portworks expansion, irrigation expansion, modernization of airport facilities, nationwide flood control, and forest resources development. These special funds will provide steady sources of financing for the projects, thus insuring their sustained implementation without depending too much on the General Fund which is also the source of financing other equally essential government services. Moreover, it is fell that special assessments levy on direct beneficiaries of projected improvements is directly related to the benefit principle of taxation.\r\nI also propose legislative action calling for the creation of a telecommunications commission to absorb the present regulatory function of the Radio Control Office, establishment of a mass transit authority, amendment of certain provisions of Republic Act No. 917, and the passage of a synchronized public works bill for the implementation of our Four-Year Infrastructure Program.\r\nLast year was significant for our national minorities. Through the PANAMIN\u2019s community development projects and medical missions, the government has continued with increased vigor and intensity to serve the needs of the cultural minorities. The private sector has also helped by donating close to P3 million to implement the different PANAMIN projects.\r\nBy proclaiming last June 5, 224 hectares as a civil reservation for the Tebolih group in South Cotabato, we benefited directly 5,000 residents in that critical area and brought peace to some 75,000 Taga-bilis, Bilaans, and others.\r\nIt is time to maintain the momentum of development by expanding the agricultural revolution into two vital areas: fish and meat production. This will supply the vital protein needs of a healthy nation at the lowest possible prices.\r\nI noticed, however, that despite its successes, the agricultural sector has not been getting enough financial assistance. No one will disagree with me, I am sure, that our economic headway can be traced to the agricultural sector. It is about time that we recognize its important contributions.\r\nI want to reorient assistance to productive economic activities with short gestation periods. In short, credit expansion in this coming year will be focused more on the agricultural sector, which continues to be the nucleus of all economic activity in the country.\r\nNow that we have stabilized our rice supply, we shall devote our attention to crop diversificaton.\r\nWe can achieve similar breakthroughs in the other crops. We have clearly demonstrated that given the proper motivation and equipped with the proper tools, we can increase production without increasing acreage.\r\nYou are all aware that we are now giving priority to the production of feed grains to support livestock production. The National Food and Agriculture Council has embarked on a program of feed grains production, particularly yellow corn, sorghum, and soybeans. The increase in the supply of these crops will lower the production cost of meat and therefore its price in the market.\r\nFrom all indications, the 1970 sugar crop of 2.1 million short tons, raw value, will be the highest sugar production on record. This will allow us t0 return part of the additional quota appropriation from the Puerto Rican deficit last year.\r\nAt this juncture, I should like to issue an appeal to sugarcane planters and sugarmillers to work together towards the synchronization of field and mill operations.\r\nThis will enhance the productivity of this sector and enable it to increase its contribution to the social amelioration fund of its workers.\r\nOur coconut product industry is undergoing a very trying period. After picking up by the middle of last year, production and exports have been stunted by natural calamities such as droughts and typhoons. Furthermore, coconut oil and copra are sluggish in the world markets.\r\nI cannot think of a better way to rehabilitate the coconut sector than to propose an amendment to the Export Tax Law or R.A. 6125: Instead of gradually diminishing the rate of the peso earnings to be imposed and assessed on our coconut product exports, the rate for the year should be maintained and the proceeds from this earmarked solely for coconut rehabilitation and development.\r\nConsiderable progress has been attained by the livestock industry, particularly in poultry and hog raising.\r\nAside from the production expected from the feed grain program of the National Food and Agricultural Council, we are exploring the feasibility of tapping several institutions for financing. Two FAO/World Bank missions have visited the country to help us prepare a project loan for livestock financing for the World Bank. These funds, if approved, may be channeled into the development of our cattle, hog, and poultry industries.\r\nWe are determined to attain self-sufficiency in at least poultry and pork within the next three years.\r\n1970 was a good year for the fishing industry, especially in terms of foreign assistance. Joint efforts of the ADB and the UNDP have been directed towards establishing the NavotasFishingPort, the first of its kind in the country.\r\nThe completion of a major fish hatchery in Candaba, the conversion of the Candaba swamps into freshwater fish farms with FAO assistance, and the successful breeding of imported carp by the Philippine Fisheries Commission are among the important breakthroughs in this sector in 1970.\r\nWe have recently finalized a P6.9-million project establishing two major fish research stations that will provide training and extension services to our inland fisheries producers. This is part of a major fish production program that we launched last June.\r\nOur goal within the next three years is not only self-sufficiency in fish but possibly the joining of the ranks of exporters of fish and fish products.\r\nToday, land reform encompasses 161 towns in 16 provinces and benefits some 224,361 palay and corn farmers working more than half-a-million hectares of farm lands. Of these, some 137,585 were erstwhile share-tenants working an area of 320,992 hectares. These tenants are now lessees by operation of law.\r\nAs of December 1970, 33 agricultural estates covering 3,874 hectares and worked by 1,547 farmers were acquired by the Land Bank at a cost of P15,697,300. Preemption and redemption deposit payments have been made in the Court of Agrarian Relations for eight other estates in the amount of P963,836. Forty-five other estates are under negotiations, while petitions for the purchase of 341 estates are under investigation by the technical staff of the Land Authority and the Land Bank. In addition, the Land Authority has acquired six landed estates worth P6.2 million under R.A. 1400 consisting of 2,944 hectares with 1,212 beneficiaries.\r\nLand distribution has been expedited. As of November 1970, 21,512 contracts were perfected, representing 14,989 orders of awards, 344 agreements to sell, and 6,184 deeds of sale. Under Administrative Order No. 100 of 1969, the Land Authority has already issued a total of 1,479 patents to farm-families within its settlement projects.\r\nLand reform increased agricultural productivity. In land reform areas, average rice yield per hectare in 1966 was 48.9 cavans for the first crop and 41 cavans for the second crop. At present, the production per hectare is 63.1 cavans for the first crop and 64.5 cavans for the second crop, representing an increase of 29.4 and 57.3%, respectively. This experience has led the National Land Reform Council and the National Food and Agriculture Council to integrate two government programs\u2014land reform and agricultural production, with Nueva Ecija as a pilot province.\r\nThe National Land Reform Council is testing new approaches and schemes to improve the life of our farmers.\r\nSupported by the Filipinas Foundation, the Magalang Project is an experiment to prove that increased production, not just land ownership, is the primary objective of land reform. This project is patterned after the Moshave of Israel, which is actually a cooperative of leaseholder-settlers. Similar projects are being undertaken by the Land Authority in Agusan del Sur and in Palawan, also with the cooperation and support of private institutions.\r\nThe fact is we have been engaged in the promotion and development of cooperatives for some time now. Lack of experience in the techniques of organization and management as well as inconsistent policies and insufficient support impeded the efforts until 1963. Since then, however, using the experience of previous efforts, under the Agricultural Credit Administration and the Agricultural Productivity Commission, we have produced strong and sound models.\r\nAbout 200 agricultural cooperatives, primarily of the multipurpose type, are now actively operating on the municipal level in addition to hundreds of credit unions and consumers cooperatives in the nonagricultural sector.\r\nThese cooperatives are now effectively channeling credit to small farmers, introducing new farm technology, procuring and distributing production inputs, unifying marketing, and forming capital. They are gradually integrating upward to the processing and marketing activities and downward to production and will eventually move to such strategic areas as banking, insurance, housing, and other desirable enterprises.\r\nIn the last session of this Congress, I certified HB 866 providing for a system of developing cooperatives. However, it was not passed. I urge this Congress to review this bill, to update it, and to enact it into law.\r\nWe are also considering the feasibility of implementing a land swap scheme which would involve the purchase by the Land Bank of private agricultural lands in heavily tenanted areas and the concomitant sale of raw public agricultural lands through public bidding, the bidders to include those who voluntarily sold their land to the Land Bank. In effect, the proposed scheme would involve the exchange of developed private agricultural land with public agricultural lands value-for-value. Hence, the program of land acquisition for eventual resale to tenants and leaseholders could be pursued, while at the same time, unproductive public lands could be developed.\r\nIn line with the conservation of our natural resources, I am considering the creation of a National Coordinating Council charged with the task of reviewing land utility policies with the end of minimizing land conflicts altogether.\r\nOur present land policy countenances possession by a few persons and entities of vast idle lands. This defect in our land policy must now be corrected. A new land policy, designed to force development of all idle lands, public or private, is now in order.\r\nI shall seek\u2014through legislation or, if necessary, through constitutional amendment\u2014 the cancellation of titles and awards on public lands which have remained idle over the years. Private enterprises which are willing and able to develop such idle lands shall receive government support and encouragement. If private enterprise is unwilling, then the government shall undertake their development.\r\nI also propose to impose confiscatory tax rates on idle private lands in order to compel their owners either to develop them or sell them to the government or to persons who are in a better position to develop them.\r\nI therefore ask the owners of idle lands to start developing their lands. Otherwise, they will face the prospect of the cancellation of their titles or awards in the case of public land or the imposition of confiscatory taxes in the case of private lands.\r\nThe election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention last year gave us the opportunity to introduce major electoral innovations. These innovations applied only to the election of delegates last November, but the experience gained gave us a basis for introducing permanent amendments to the Revised Election Code which governs all other elections.\r\nExcept for irregularities in some provinces, the last election was generally hailed as peaceful and orderly.\r\nThe following reforms, already successfully tried out in the election of delegates, should now be introduced permanently into our electoral system:\r\nI also recommend that the following provisions be incorporated into our Election Code:\r\nThe administrative machinery of government must be restructured and revitalized to meet the challenge of change and development.\r\nWithin the next 40 days, I shall submit to Congress an integrated reorganization plan to make our governmental administration more economical, efficient, and effective. This plan, prepared by the Commission on Reorganization after 18 months of intensive work, will enable us to pursue with greater vigor and success our programs for accelerated social and economic advancement.\r\nOne of the main thrusts in this government reorganization is deconcentration and decentralization. The Office of the President will be freed from administrative detail: It shall concentrate on major policy planning and development. The number of agencies reporting directly to the President will be reduced from some 150 offices to only 25; many matters now requiring Presidential action will be delegated to the department heads. At the same time, more powers and responsibilities will devolve on the regional offices.\r\nThe departments, as a rule, will maintain an integrated field service in 10 uniform regions. With administrative decision and action being made at the level closest to the people, we can be assured of less red tape and more speed; less buck-passing and greater responsiveness in the giving of governmental services.\r\nSecondly, the reorganization plan seeks to improve the processes of planning and decision making at all levels; most important is the proposed creation of a national economic development authority, NEDA for short, to compose of the President as chairman and with top congressional and executive officials as members. The NEDA will review and approve the national development plans to govern all socioeconomic policies and programs of the government.\r\nThe reorganization plan, moreover, provides for structural and administrative innovations to strengthen the merit system. The present single-headed Civil Service Commission will be converted into a three-man commission to serve primarily as a standard-setting and -enforcing agency, while personnel functions will be decentralized to line agencies and regional offices. The career civil service will be reinvigorated primarily through (1) a single career undersecretary for each department and (2) a career executive service composed of well-selected and development-oriented administrators to provide administrative leadership while serving as catalysts for administrative efficiency, innovation and, development.\r\nLastly, the department shall be reorganized to increase their capacity to plan and implement programs in accordance with policies set by Congress and the President. Special emphasis will be given to the acceleration of programs related to increased productivity, land reform, full exploitation of natural resources, trade promotion, and manpower development.\r\nTo attain simplicity, economy, and efficiency in government operations, the bureaus and offices will be grouped primarily on the basis of major functions, thereby minimizing duplication and overlapping of activities. The number of bureaus, commissions, and boards is expected to be reduced by 20%. Savings in personnel and operating expenditures will be rechanneled to developmental projects.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that the transformation of our society will take place peaceably and legally through the making of a new Constitution. The cynical few would prejudice the Constitutional Convention as a futile exercise even before it has begun. But I am expressing, I believe, the sentiments of the delegates-elect that those few may rest assured that their rights as Filipinos and free citizens will be promoted by the Constitutional Convention.\r\nStill, even before the making of a new fundamental charter, I would like to see immediate rectification of certain inequities in our society. The great Filipino masses, to be sure, have their own responsibilities, but it is they who have had to bear the burden of our nation. I would place the burden of shaping a better society in which they have no place.\r\nFor those who have much, much is required. This is not only fair; it is absolutely just.\r\nThe thrust of the times is towards social and economic justice. There can no longer be any explanations; there has to be an end to procrastinations. We must begin to change\u2014now.\r\nGrave as our problems might be and though our hopes and our patience may be strained to the limit, we must resolve, as a nation, never to stand divided.\r\nWe must resolve to keep united because the alternative to unity is division, and division is fratricide.\r\nThe words of a great man and a great friend of the Filipino people, Pope Paul VI, should in this regard be taken to heart:\r\nThere are certain situations whose injustice cries to heaven. When whole populations destitute of necessities, live in a state of dependence barring them from initiative and responsibility, and all opportunity to advance culturally and share in social and political life, recourse to violence, as a means to right this wrong to human dignity, is a grave temptation.\r\nBut there is an urgent truth we must face unflinchingly. National unity on the old terms\u2014the domination of the many by the few\u2014may no longer be feasible. The supreme challenge to this generation is to redefine the terms of this unity, so that it will rest on enduring foundations of social justice and true fraternity. Only by forging anew our unity on the basis of far-reaching social and economic reforms, motivated by a profound regard for the dignity of the human person, can we defend this unity and preserve it against other claims, especially radical ones.\r\nThe unity that I have in mind is large enough to contain all views, ideas, and beliefs so long as they give due regard to law and order. In the end, the task of changing the frame work and redefining the basis of our national unity will be exercised by the Constitutional Convention.\r\nBut the task of reshaping this framework should not wait at all for tomorrow, it should not wait for ideal conditions.\r\nWe must, without further delay, reexamine the postulates of our society with regard to the ownership of land, particularly public land; the place of the worker in industry, in terms of security and dignity; the recreation of an exploitative society into a cooperative one; the broadening of our horizons in the world community.\r\nI ask that the Congress of the Philippines immediately indicate these proposals on its agenda for this regular session that begins today.\r\nI ask that our people brace themselves for a democratic revolution that will reach to the roots of our institutions. And if it is the nation\u2019s wish that the President himself lead this revolution, then I accept the challenge.", "title": "The Democratic Revolution"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 24, 1972]\r\nIn these times of rupture\u2014of a breaking of nations, of radical change in values, of sudden departures and great, perilous beginnings\u2014we stand as a people and as a nation.\r\nThis nation stands, tested by adversity and deriving strength from it, sum\u00admoning a fresh will from the continuing challenges that are the historical legacy of all struggling nations.\r\nYes, this nation not only stands; it will also prevail.\r\nI know that some of you would be satisfied by an admission of failure, a confession of weakness, a contrite promise to do better, but such a posture will neither lift the cloud from our minds nor carry our nation forward. We have not been mandated by our people to inaugurate the age of despair.\r\nOur nation has passed through difficult times\u2014and prevailed.\r\nHonesty permits neither pessimism nor complacency.\r\nWe have blind partisans from both sides of the fence. There is total darkness for one side and dazzling brightness for the other. Clinging to either of these absolutes may reveal our temperament, but it will neither define our condition nor secure our future as a nation.\r\nOur continuing survival, no less than our hopes for a better life, will depend on how seriously and how honestly we make the effort to understand the times we live in. We have just been through a most difficult year, and this is true for the rest of the world as it is with us. Only the most insular among us will fail to understand that many of the major decisions that affect our daily lives are made not in our own country but in the distant centers of the world.\r\nThe monetary crisis last year, as a consequence of which the American dollar was to all intents and purposes, devalued, created a situation in which, as someone observed, the \u201cpoor nations of the world are compelled to maintain the high living standards of the rich.\u201d We were not exempted from the effects of this radical monetary event.\r\nDiplomatic crisis\u2014whether it be the admission of the People\u2019s Republic of China to the United Nations, the threat of world war, or the actual outbreak of war between India and Pakistan\u2014affected the economic environments of all nations, but most of all, the poor.\r\nOn the domestic scene, the reestablishment of the Communist Party of the Philippines, with a Jacobin zeal for domination and conquest, the creation of Communist front organizations, the Maoist uprisings, the recriminations of the 1971 campaign, the corruption of our police agencies, the rise in the consump\u00adtion of drugs and pornography, not to say the bloody conflicts between Christians and Muslims in Mindanao\u2014all these struck us with simultaneous force.\r\nWe had to survive all these crises or not at all. And for this reason, we took the limited options open to us as a small and developing nation.\r\nI need not mention at length anymore the natural calamities that beset the country last December and early this year.\r\nBut one thing is undeniable: 1971 saddled us with crises\u2014not singly but in battalia.\r\nWe were not given elegant choices. We just had to survive, and there was only one way: to impose restrictions on ourselves.\r\nI invite you, therefore, to consider the good along with the bad, to put our successes side by side with our failures\u2014in sum, to clarify in our minds the magnitude of the challenge to our national existence.\r\nHonesty demands that we consider the undeniable gains in the economy along with the throwbacks to our stagnant past. Faced with adversity, we shifted our economic emphasis from consumption to production, from imports to exports. We floated the peso to measure our real worth, for we paid heavily for the economic proclivities of an irresponsible and possibly naive past. All the tough decisions of economic development and social progress were made with the full knowledge of their consequences, some of which are, indeed, punish\u00ading. But these decisions had to be made. The alternative was between a protracted life of dubious comfort and a long life of a secure national future.\r\nIt is an ancient propensity of men to look for scapegoats in adversity. This has been the easy foundation of most political criticism. But political responsi\u00adbility obliges us to look for causes. The search for scapegoats is always a futile exercise.\r\nLet us honestly understand one fundamental thing about our national con\u00addition. And that is: through all our policies and actuations in the past six years, we have been solving the problems spawned by past errors and misjudgments; we are just beginning to tackle those generated by the present\u2014and we have yet to anticipate those that will face us in the future. Leadership now is a three-headed Janus looking back, front, and forward through the entire dimension of time.\r\nWill I, then, apologize that in facing the crisis born out of the past, this leadership must yet meet the pressing problems of the present? Shall we regret vainly that no nation is endowed with the capacity for solving all important problems simultaneously? Shall we lament the fact that the fate of men and nations is to solve their problems according to an order of precedence?\r\nWe have long passed the age of innocence. We are much wiser now, and we know that all our dreams have their responsibilities, all our aspirations their in\u00adevitable price. To understand this is to understand what we can do so that we shall not drain energies lamenting those that we cannot do.\r\nWe cannot achieve progress at the pace and of the nature that we wish without counting the human and material cost.\r\nWe cannot have the peace and order that are ideally desired without per\u00adsonally involving ourselves in attaining it.\r\nWe cannot, as the saying goes, have guns and butter in equal and great amounts.\r\nEvery goal we choose involves a hard choice\u2014a sacrifice, on the one hand, and an aspiration, on the other. To believe that there is a soft choice is to live, as some of us do now, in a fool\u2019s paradise.\r\nLast year I spoke of the need to make an accommodation with reality. That reality is now upon us. Forces set in motion over the last two years have begun to alter the character of international relations. In the short span of one year, world affairs have acquired a new and more precise shape, with the hopeful elements predominating and setting the stage for fresh constructive endeavors on behalf of stability and durable peace.\r\nNo one minimizes the great potential for crisis in such problem areas as the Middle East where outlook for peace has dimmed in the past year; or in Indo\u00adchina where the war has decelerated without opening new vistas for permanent settlement. In Africa, south of the Sahara, characteristic tensions incident to the problems of nation-building continue to make the region of the world highly volatile and unpredictable, characteristics which are emphasized by the unresolved problem of racialism and violation of human rights. The recent eruption of violence between India and Pakistan is an unfortunate reminder of the still precarious balance which obtains between the forces of order and disorder.\r\nIn the changing context of world affairs, however, it can be said that the range of available means for the management of world tensions has increased in the past year. The tacit agreement to the status quo in Europe has resulted in fruitful initiatives the consequences of which are already visible in the growing unity of the Common Market countries, in the removal of the causes of friction in Berlin, and in the rapprochement between the Socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the rest of the continent.\r\nThus, in Europe there is a new stability which will contribute in highly significant ways to the resolution of one of the world\u2019s most difficult and most persistent problems, namely, the limitation of the weapons of war.\r\nBut the changed character of world affairs is more marked in Asia. Two events of colossal impact on world events occurred in 1971\u2014the admission of the People\u2019s Republic of China into the United Nations, signifying a complete turn in the foreign policies of nations; and the beginnings of a rapprochement between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China which, if consummated, will almost certainly cause the most far-reaching alteration in the relations among nations in more than one generation.\r\nThe Philippines, in recognition of its compelling national interests and in response to the inevitable pressures or new world developments, necessarily has to modify its outlook and revise its policies in ways which take a more precise account of its interests in a radically altered world environment. Thus in the last 12 months we have begun a process of change unprecedented in our short history as a free country. Flexibility has been the touchstone of the emerg\u00ading foreign policy of the Philippines; the national interest its unchanging guide; and a hard and independent assessment of new international realities its new hallmark.\r\nChange implies two things\u2014on the one hand, the resolution of old problems, and on the other the emergence of new, and often not less difficult, problems. Frequently, they are faces of the same coin. If the impending rapprochement between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China has diminished the chances of widespread conflict in Asia, it has also raised in a new and alarming form the question of national and regional security, particularly in Southeast Asia. The problem arises in the expected intensification of internal subversion. Insofar as subversion is an internal problem, the classic solutions are as follows\u2014a strengthened military capability, and intensified social and economic development as a means of improving the national capacity to resist dissidence. These solutions we are determined to pursue.\r\nOur need is to gain time. It is for this reason that I would prefer new conver\u00adsations with the United States leading to the formulation of programs in anti\u00adcipation of the consequences of American phaseout from Southeast Asia. A practical plan which can be put into effect in the interim period should diminish anxieties not only in the Philippines but throughout the region. At the same time it should place us in an unassailable position of strength, militarily, socially, and economically, in dealing with the expected upsurge of dissidence.\r\nThe problem of subversion will, in the future, assume regional dimensions. Therefore, it is important that the steps being taken to strengthen economic collaboration in the region be supplemented by cooperation in this limited military sense. We realize that a regional military alliance is not feasible, nor is it, with its inevitable overtones of the diminishing Cold War, a desirable one. However, simpler forms of military cooperation, perhaps in exchanges of views and information, may be useful in the circumstances.\r\nThe problem of security and the problem of increased economic strength lead me to the view that the prospects of regional collaboration will improve considerably in the future. The work of the ASEAN and the ASPAC, together with regional initiatives undertaken outside of these important institutions, will begin to assume great importance in our lives.\r\nIt is for this reason that I have urged the convening of a meeting of heads of state in order to study more thoroughly the whole range of alternative open to the region to insure security and to intensify economic and social cooperation. No greater obligation devolves upon the countries of Southeast Asia. We have already endorsed the plan for the neutralization of Southeast Asia in principle and shall study, in concert with fellow members of the ASEAN, various implementation plans to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the decla\u00adration of foreign ministers.\r\nLess than two weeks ago, the Philippines took the fateful step of opening diplomatic relations with two Socialist countries of Eastern Europe, namely, Romania and Yugoslavia. Depending upon the success of these initiatives\u2014and there is no reason to doubt their success\u2014we will study the possibility of relations with other Socialist countries of Europe as part of the widening web of intercourse with friendly countries.\r\nThe opening of relations with Yugoslavia and Romania should be regarded therefore only as a first step in a worldwide rapprochement with Socialist countries. Because of certain difficulties, many of a technical diplomatic character, it is not possible at this time to establish relations with the Soviet Union. However, I hope that before my term as President is over, we shall have overcome those difficulties and that the long-deferred mutual relations between the Philippines and the Soviet Union shall have been set up on a firm basis.\r\nIn dealing with other nations, we operate on the principle that the world is no longer dichotomous. On the contrary, today is the era of multiple alignments. We are required, therefore, to make concurrent efforts to ease the way towards the establishment of relations with the Soviet Union\u2019s rival Socialist state, the People\u2019s Republic of China.\r\nWith that great power, we will undoubtedly have official and unofficial contacts with its representatives in the United Nations. In recognition of the right of its more than 900 million people to be represented in the world organi\u00adzation, we supported their admission into the United Nations. We feel that their presence there will be beneficial\u2014and indeed necessary\u2014to the solution of numerous world problems. At the same time, we hope that its membership in the world body will encourage Asia\u2019s lone nuclear power to use its expanding influence for constructive purposes which will benefit Asia and the rest of the world.\r\nThe question of bilateral association with the People\u2019s Republic of China at this time is complicated by the unclear nature of its relations with the Nationalist regime in Taipei. As far as we are concerned, we welcome all forms of inter\u00adcourse with the two governments. This has been made difficult, however, by the conditions relating to these internal differences between the two which the two governments seek to impose on the world at large. Therefore, an early settle\u00adment of the Peking-Taipei question, on their own free choice, should make it easier for us and for many other nations to realize the objective of multiple alignments in this part of the world.\r\nIn the task of shaping foreign policy, the national leadership as reflected in the Foreign Policy Council fortunately has approached such tasks in the spirit of bipartisanship. This speaks well of all of us, for the starting point of foreign policy is always the national interest, and once this interest is identified, our leaders must close ranks. There could be no better proof of the creative use of foreign policy to secure the national interest than the organization of a consulta\u00adtive group of countries showing confidence in the soundness of the Philippine future by allotting us urgently needed assistance.\r\nIt is our hope that we shall always be able to depend on such bipartisan cooperation to resolve outstanding issues of foreign policy. One such question is the recognition of the new state of Bangladesh, which is under study by the Foreign Policy Council. This question has to be examined not only in the light of our libertarian history but also of our present alliance.\r\nThe most urgent problem of the nation today\u2014possibly through the rest of this decade\u2014is the problem of peace and order. All our plans for development, themselves urgent, are contingent upon our successful management of this grave national problem. Only in conditions of calm and social stability may we hope to undertake the manifold and diverse tasks necessary for sustained growth.\r\nPeace and order, therefore, leads the agenda of government through the remainder of my administration. I am determined that the challenge to public authority posed by criminal and lawless elements will be met this year and the next with all the power and resources of government.\r\nAt the moment, there are two elements in the peace and order problem which constitute the real menace to government and society. These are internal subversion and the rising tide of criminality in our midst. A third element, external aggression, poses no immediate threat; as a relatively remote problem, therefore, it can be regarded with no sharp sense of urgency. I am certain that we can spread over a period of time our efforts to deal adequately with the possibility of external aggression by means of defense preparations that I shall report upon shortly.\r\nOn the other hand, internal subversion and rising crime, both of them grave and existing perils, call for swift and uncompromising action.\r\nOver the years, simple criminality, violent forms of dissent, and active in\u00adsurgency have combined to produce an increasing threat to authority. I am determined that this threat will be met with all the resources available to govern\u00adment. But for this purpose, I ask that Congress lend its full cooperation. The time to meet the challenge of lawlessness, in the form of ordinary crimes, violent upheavals, private armies, and crime syndicates, is now: beyond this year may be too late. The centers of public authority, the three branches of government, have a joint responsibility to undertake at once a powerful and relentless drive against the criminal elements which have eroded public faith in the ability of government to ensure order and stability in every community around the nation.\r\nThe increasing frequency of criminal activity poses a threat not only to duly constituted authority, but ultimately to the entire social order. This is why it is my unswerving aim that the priorities in the agenda of 1972 shall be led by a program against criminality and violence. This year, and through the next, we will permit no compromise with crime and vice; I want all the resources of government to be organized and managed so as to wage full and unremitting war against those who, for one reason or another, conceive of government as an object to be scorned, abused, and terrorized.\r\nLet it not be said, however, that I wish to perpetuate the principle of retri\u00adbutive justice which is the foundation of our antiquated Penal Code. I am fully aware that the existing Code, based on the ancient Penal Code of Spain (1848), does not make it possible for society to prevent the imminent or probable harm to society by persons socially dangerous. Modern criminologists include among such persons the professional hoodlums, murderers, thieves, bag snatchers, persons suffering from highly communicable disease, drug addicts, alcoholics, and mentally deranged persons. Suspension of sentence upon first offenders of light offenses is likewise absent from our anachronistic Penal Code.\r\nPersons socially dangerous should be placed under confinement even before they have actually struck their victim, if in the judgment of the court, after proper showing and trial the subject is socially dangerous. His confine\u00adment under the circumstances is not a punishment but a precautionary and therapeutic necessity. The subject shall be released by the court upon satis\u00adfactory evidence furnished by psychiatrist or physician that he is no longer socially dangerous or dreadful.\r\nI urge Congress to cooperate in making this reform in our penal system possible.\r\nI would be less than candid if I did not acknowledge that government could have done better by way of confronting the challenge posed by violent and criminal elements. I am aware that unsolved crimes, recurring social conflicts erupting in bloodshed in certain areas, the reported activities of so-called private armies, the increasing boldness and inventiveness of criminal elements, and repeated acts of violence in public demonstrations and rallies have contributed to the erosion of confidence in and respect for public authority.\r\nThe situation in the Philippines, however, has been aggravated by conditions of insurgency in some parts of the country, a fact which has given to the peace and order condition a unique character. No less than the Supreme Court has recognized the existence of a rebellion in the country, when it said in its historic decision concerning my suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\n: \u201cWe entertain \u2026 no doubts about the existence of a sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the government and have thus been and still are engaged in rebellion against the government of the Philippines.\u201d\r\nApart from its normal share of ordinary crime and lawlessness, therefore, the Philippines the past few years has had to face the added problem of putting down a publicly announced challenge to order and public authority. Compared to the limited means available to our police agencies, the threat of criminal elements to society is far from puny and negligible.\r\nIt is with this in mind, and fully conscious of my responsibility for the safety of our citizens and the orderliness of society, that I suspended the privilege of the writ of\r\nwhen an intolerable increase in insurgent activity came to the knowledge of our intelligence authorities. This decision was fully warranted by the circumstances; after asking itself whether \u201cpublic safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\n,\u201d the Supreme Court in the same decision declared that it was \u201cnot prepared to hold that the Executive had acted arbitrarily or gravely abused his discretion when he then concluded that public safety and national security required the suspension of the privilege of the writ. . . .\u201d\r\nThe Supreme Court has taken note of the existence of a state of rebellion in the country, and has upheld the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\nwhich I proclaimed last year. It acknowledged the validity of the view I took that lawless elements engaged in an armed insurrection and rebellion \u201chave created a state of lawlessness and disorder affecting public safety and the security of the state.\u201d These lawless elements, consisting of Communists of the Maoist faction and members of the New People\u2019s Army, had been engaged in terrorism and violent acts, such as assassinations and kidnappings, thus endangering public safety and threatening national security. It is significant that the Supreme Court, after assessing all the evidence, declared that the New People\u2019s Army is\u00a0per se\u00a0proof of the existence of a rebellion, and that consequently the President of the Philippines \u201chad reason to feel that the situation was critical\u201d and that therefore, \u201che had substantial grounds to entertain such belief.\u201d\r\nAs you will recall, I immediately lifted the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\nafter being satisfied that the Communist threat to our national security had sufficiently diminished.\r\nThe ordinary peace and order situation, though comparatively better than that obtaining in most developed as well as developing countries, is itself serious enough to call for immediate and extraordinary measures. Of the total volume of crime recorded in 1971, as compared to 1970, there was a slight increase of 7.18%. While minor offenses registered a decrease of 8.4%, index crimes rose, significantly, by 11.52%.\r\nThe contributing factors include inefficient, corrupt, and in many cases even criminal, policemen; certain politicians who have placed personal power and ambition above the public service; failures of government and of society itself to assure the safety of witnesses; and serious inadequacies in the resources of government.\r\nI ask you to look at the peacekeeping organs of government. If you look closely enough I believe you will agree that the means available to them are totally inadequate to cope with the ingenuity and willfulness of the criminal elements in our era, many of whom have been more agile and thoroughgoing than government in taking advantage of technological advances in our time. Unless our agencies are adequately supplied and supported, criminals will continue to treat government with little respect.\r\nI am especially anxious about persistent reports that many members of our police organizations not only are corrupt but are members of criminal syndicates, and as such are responsible for any number of crimes which, for obvious reasons, have remained unsolved. This situation will not be tolerated any longer. Appropriate steps are now being taken to eradicate criminal elements from within our police forces, and I hope that both the citizenry and the proper authorities will give their support and make possible this cleansing process in our police organizations.\r\nIt has come to our knowledge that many members of our police forces are linked to security agencies, reported to have a membership of around 27,000, and that many of the unsolved crimes have been committed by individuals protected by this alliance. It is my aim that the licensing of security agencies shall be immediately reviewed and that henceforth stricter measures be adopted for such licensing.\r\nThe rise of smuggling, which we had all but stamped out some years ago, has also contributed to the peace and order problem.\r\nDrug addiction and an increasing traffic in pornographic material have likewise aggravated the peace and order problem. Drugs and pornography are especially deleterious because they constitute a threat to the fabric of morality which is indispensable to the preservation of public order. They are perils against which we must be particularly watchful because they work insidiously, undermining the character and spirit of our people, and producing their peculiar form of destruction without force and violence.\r\nThese are the varied aspects of crime and lawlessness which imperil public order and the safety of our homes and individual lives. Set against the forces of the law, with their meager resources and the doubtful competence and integrity of some individual law enforcers, they give us reason to chastise ourselves and to reexamine our aims and resources.\r\nWe must therefore modernize and professionalize the national agencies, such as the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine Constabulary. The local police agencies in the urban areas must have sufficient mobile units and communications equipment as well as recording systems to enable them to operate with efficiency. All of them must develop continuing programs of their own to train their staffs in up-to-date methods and facilities against crime.\r\nIt is no less important in our effort to deal with crime that we develop the regional concept in crime control. All too often, there are incidents which exceed the jurisdiction or competence of local police agencies. For this problem, there are two possible solutions: either arrange an organizational tie-up between the national and local police agencies, or bring local agencies together in a consortium or a metropolitan police-type of arrangement which will, among other things, allow a sharing of resources and avoid conflicts\u2014an all-too-common weakness.\r\nFor most cases it may be preferable to have local agencies working together, without involving the national agency. The organizational require\u00adments for such exclusively regional tie-ups could, however, be complicated, and would in such a case perhaps call for legislative action. If police reforms attain nationwide proportions through legislative support, I foresee local communities, singly or collectively, assuming greater responsibility for their security, freeing the national police agencies for specific tasks involving national security.\r\nSince there are deficiencies in the law that created the Police Commission, the legislative program I am going to propose includes the amendment of the Police Act so as to enhance more readily the professionalization of our police forces.\r\nThe drug menace, by all indications, is spreading particularly among the young. This year, we must launch a special campaign and create funds to eradicate this new menace.\r\nAt the same time, I am convinced that drug addiction should be approached from the psychiatric or medical viewpoint, rather than regarded strictly as crime.\r\nThe problem of loose firearms compounds the peace and order problem. The Department of National Defense has launched a drive by the Armed Forces in collecting and registering loose firearms. This mission also involves agencies like the NBI, the Police Commission, local police forces, and the Peace and Order Coordinating Council.\r\nLast year, 5,252 loose firearms were collected, captured or confiscated; 760 holders of loose firearms were apprehended and prosecuted; and 32,300 assorted firearms were registered.\r\nFrom all the foregoing, it is quite clear that public participation in pre\u00adserving peace and order is an important element of the total effort that I propose to undertake against crime and lawlessness. Before my term is over, I wish to see that this public participation, among others in the form of greater vigilance, more active support of public agencies by means of voluntary testimony, and the like, shall have become more assertive and consistent. I cannot stress too much that the citizenry has a crucial role in determining the conditions in which it shall live.\r\nI have repeatedly said that the continuance of the United States protective umbrella in the Asian region is one of the realities that we will have to live with through the next several years. But Asian security is essentially the responsi\u00adbility of Asians; it is therefore incumbent upon us now to take every possible step towards self-reliance in the defense of our homelands in this region against aggression and internal subversion.\r\nI have therefore directed the Armed Forces to undertake a program over the next five years aimed at developing a self-reliant defense posture. This program will entail the expenditure of P1.5 billion, or an annual appropriation of P300 million, exclusive of current yearly outlays for the Armed Forces.\r\nI am certain our people share my determination that this program be carried out successfully, so that the national desire to achieve unilateral defense capabilities shall be fulfilled without unnecessary delay. There are two basic requirements for the fulfillment of this national goal. We must, on the one hand, expand the concept of citizenship training for defense.\r\nThe second requirement for the success of this program is adequate equip\u00adment. This will assume increasing importance in the next few years because of the diminishing assistance through the military assistance program, and the gradual withdrawal of American military forces in the Far East.\r\nOur military authorities are even now evolving a training program geared to nonconventional warfare capabilities, using indigenous materials for wartime requirements.\r\nI realize that to safeguard the nation adequately from any external or internal threat to its security and to the peaceful pursuit of its aspirations, we need more than improvements in the organization and resources of our defense establishment. A more important requirement is the solidarity of mind and purpose among our people, that essential loyalty to flag and country which is the key to national stability and genuine progress. I therefore take this oppor\u00adtunity to call on all segments of society once again to provide our government the moral support for our program of national security and survival.\r\nDuring the past six years, I devoted major portions of my State of the Nation message to economic issues. This preoccupation with the economy sterns from my firm belief that continuous progress of our society is possible only if it rests on a vigorous economic foundation.\r\nThe performance of the economy during this period may be the subject of a number of plausible interpretations.\r\nToday, we have conflicting viewpoints about our economy. The pessimists see, for instance, the following failings or deficiencies in our society, and on such a basis, predict our collapse:\r\nThe optimists, on the other hand, see only the achievements, like:\r\nA true picture is a blend of these two extreme views, a mosaic of achieve\u00adments and failings. Even the cynics would agree that our experience in the past six years demonstrated that\r\nThese capabilities were demonstrated by the self-sufficiency levels of rice production in 1968-1970 and the expanding output of other agricultural crops, like bananas; by the operation of satellite communications; by the experimentation in agricultural research institutions; by the development of financial markets and of the banking system; by the growing sophistication of marketing techniques; by the enactment of the export tax and the passage of the export incentives act; by the expansion in exports and the stabilization of the peso; by the restructuring of the foreign debt and the larger availability of liberal external financial assistance; and by the enlarged coverage of irrigation facilities.\r\nApplication of these capabilities had, as confluence, the growth of national income at the average annual rate of 6.2% between 1965 and 1969, exceeding the 5% growth target set by the United Nations for the development decade of the 1960s; the increase in export earnings from $737 million in 1965 to P1,118 million in 1971; the emergence of new products in industry and agriculture; the adoption of high-yielding varieties in rice agriculture; the growth of retail supermarkets; and the gradual diversification of the regional and product composition of our exports.\r\nOne outstanding feature of our recent experience is that when the private sector and the government act in concert, their combined efforts result in almost immediate solution to difficult economic problems. As a result, the per\u00adformance of the economy in the past six years, compared to achievements in previous periods as well as the performance of other democratic countries, is something that we can be proud of.\r\nThese are some of the key features of the economy in 1971:\r\nEconomic performance must be measured against the targets of perform\u00adance we have set for ourselves. Invariably, the targets set out in the development plans have been exceeded by our economy\u2019s performance.\r\nFor instance, our development plan in fiscal year 1970 was planned at a rate of 5% growth. The actual growth of the economy in real terms (in constant 1967 prices) was 6.4% that fiscal year. Our revised develop\u00adment plan for FY 1971-1974 set a target growth rate of 4.5% for fiscal year 1971 in view of the anticipated effects of the fiscal and monetary stabiliza\u00adtion program. All things considered, the actual growth rate for the same period was 5.5%, in excess of 1% over target.\r\nIt is in line with these facts that in the adoption of a rolling Four-Year Development Plan for FY 1972-1975, the growth targets of performance against which we have matched our resources have been raised. In fiscal year 1972, the current one, our aim is to raise the economy\u2019s growth by 6.5%. Based on the economy\u2019s performance this year of 6.5% expansion, we are now on the way to achieving our fiscal year 1972 targets for the economy. Thereafter, we aim to attain a 7% annual growth rate.\r\nHowever, growth rates alone convey no meaning unless planning itself can guarantee that this growth reaches the widest possible number of beneficiaries within a certain period. We plan the economy to benefit the social needs of our citizens.\r\nIn this vein, we have addressed the development program to respond to the social needs of our people. The social programs which recur in every sectoral plan for the economy is designed to cut unemployment, boost incomes, elevate living and health standards, and provide essential utilities like power and water in the rural areas.\r\nThrough an all-out strategy of land reform, land distribution, food produc\u00adtion campaigns, and general welfare projects, the social programs all hope to eliminate the prime sources of social discontent.\r\nOne important consequence of these growth targets is the increase in employment opportunities for our growing labor force. Coupled with various policy changes which shift favorable incentives for labor-intensive industries, the employment picture will be improved. This is not to say that unemployment will be erased. We start out with fairly heavy magnitudes of unemployment. The process of economic development, moreover, has a way of exposing hidden underemployment into \u201copen\u201d unemployment. But the only way to provide more employment and thereby reduce unemployment is by economic growth and wise policies.\r\nIt is not yet recognized by many of our people that the economy\u2019s perform\u00adance is also subject to factors which are outside the sphere of influence of the government, the businessmen, and other members of our society.\r\nThe monetary crisis at the beginning of 1970, for instance, was due in large part to the unhistoric combination of a drop in world prices of coconut products and a contraction in Philippine coconut production in 1969. The drop in prices was due mainly to developments in the countries that buy our coconut products, which is outside of our control, and the latter was in turn due to the heavy typhoons late in 1968. As a consequence of these two external factors, exports of coconut products decreased by $73 million in 1969 and this accounted for more than one-half of the $137 million balance of payments deficit in that year.\r\nThe calamities wrought by typhoons in 1968 were repeated towards the end of 1970. This time, the calamities wrought havoc to rice and corn production and distribution in the Bicol region, thence in Central Luzon, and finally in Cotabato. Before the farmers could recover from the ravages wrought by the typhoons, the\r\ndisease crept in and aborted the natural upturn in rice production. As a consequence, consumer prices continued to rise in late 1970 and 1971 and rice had to be imported to supplement domestic supplies.\r\nThe slower growth of exports in 1971, compared to the previous year, as another example, was brought about by adverse developments in the world market reminiscent of what happened in 1969. This time, the factors that operated during the second half of 1971 were the port strikes in the United States and the disturbances in world trade and payments brought about by the August 15, 1971, dollar defense measures of President Nixon. The adverse effect of these factors was manifested in the decrease in world prices and physical volume of demand for lumber products, copper, and coconut products.\r\nWhile we have thus shown that economic difficulties could be solved, we have yet to contend with the problem of consolidating the gains we have achieved in certain areas as, at the same time, we go on to other fields of endeavor for sustaining the momentum of economic development. We have yet to acquire the reserves to meet temporary shortfalls, such as those brought about by adverse weather conditions, crop infestation, and international developments, without having to sacrifice the new programs that would yield the continuity of our economic progress.\r\nHowever, our economic vigor has potentials that have not been fully tapped. Just look around our neighboring countries and we see progress measured in excess of 10% growth per year. Given our better endowment of resources and the ingenuity and flexibility of our people, there is no reason why our society and economy should not be able to achieve as much and why we should not impose later much higher goals than we now have.\r\nThe requirements for much faster growth are basically tied to economic policy reforms of a sweeping character. We have tried to spell these out in the present Four-Year Development Plan.\r\nSome of these we have already done. We have instituted basic changes, especially the exchange rate reform we adopted in 1970. But this measure still requires further complementation from various policies that are part of a consistent framework.\r\nOur quest for the combination that would bring about the full realization of our economy\u2019s potentialities therefore continues. Finding the right combina\u00adtion is urgent not only because of the inexorable pressure of our expanding population, but also because the complexity of economic operations rises with the level of economic activities. We are not looking for\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0solutions, but rather we are searching for structural changes.\r\nAn example of changes we had to adopt recently is in the area of tariffs. I am in favor of sweeping tariff reform, which will revise the total structure of our tariff system and enable it to serve our high goals of economic development, efficiency, and protection.\r\nBut in the meantime that the mind of Congress is not made up, we have to make do with patchwork changes designed to restructure tariffs to the end that we may better be able to encourage local production, improve customs administration and collection turnover, conserve foreign exchange, and promote other economic goals.\r\nThis year, two important executive actions undertaken by powers given to me by Congress led to a rewriting of some parts of the present Tariff Code. The real achievement of these recent tariff changes relates not to the span of ground covered, but more importantly, to the \u201coverall\u201d consistency that the rehashed package now lends to a once disorganized and voluminous tariff code. The \u201coverall\u201d approach that I hope will be adopted by Congress is a far cry from the patchwork remedies that we have had to do in the meantime.\r\nWe continue to witness the unfailing vote of confidence shown by inter\u00adnational bodies regarding our economic capability as gauged from the onstream of external financial assistance.\r\nTrue, government coordinating and planning efforts are still engaged in restructuring our external debt through an orderly phasing out of amortizations along with a calculated dosage of new debts incurred.\r\nIn the inaugural meeting of the Consultative Group in Paris last year, our credit relations with the total world community were favorably assessed. The Consultative Group, which is instituted by the World Bank, is the forum for aid coordination and development assistance from both bilateral and multilateral sources, with four major countries as members and seven others as observers, and five major international bodies.\r\nI am proud to report that we are getting increasing support from the inter\u00adnational financial community. During 1971, external financial assistance with long-term maturities was extended to the Philippines in the amount of $145.9 million.\r\nThe external financial assistance already extended in 1971 came from:\r\nU.S. Government\r\nUnder P.

This document has been acted upon and approved by the UNDP governing council. The assistance therein requested is designed to utilize inputs from different specialized UN agencies primarily for realizing the targets in the development plan to which the proposal has actually been annexed. In addition, we continue to receive supplementary assistance from other UN Agencies and other bilateral sources of technical cooperation and assistance.\r\nThe continued confidence we are generating for long-term development assistance from the Consultative Group, other foreign governments, and international banking institutions depends on how we continue to raise our own internal effort in raising domestic sources of finance. This means that our government must increase noninflationary counterpart financing for long-term loans and for programs of foreign assistance from all sources. Without counterpart finance, the amount of development resources we can have will be fairly more limited than we can presently raise and absorb. This is because the devel\u00adopment loans we need to help ourselves will not be forthcoming in the same volume. For us, the unwanted consequence of this would be a reduced rate of economic development, not more. Therefore, I am proposing that we raise additional tax resources to be part of the Development Fund which I shall refer to again. This will assure that we can achieve the investment goals of our Four-Year Development Plan.\r\nIn the monetary field, the growth of money supply in 1971 was moderate. If grew only by 7% as compared with about 19% in 1969. Domestic credit grew by 12% in 1971 or an estimated amount of P1.67 billion enabling total credit to reach P15.77 billion. Of this increase, the private sector accounted for P1.37 billion, and the government, only P0.3 billion.\r\nThe moderate growth in credit and money supply assured stability and growth in the economy. As all of you know, excessive money supply and credit create demand which results in increased prices and imports, thus endangering international reserves.\r\nIn 1971, the international reserves reached $245 million. $35.5 million higher than its $209.4 million level on December 31, 1970, or about twice the level in December 1960. This level of reserves was achieved despite heavy external debt service payments and adverse international monetary and trade developments during the second half of 1971.\r\nThe debt payments in 1971 totaled $471.5 and, as a result, the total debt of the Philippines was reduced by $100 million by December 1971 as compared with the December 1970 level.\r\nThe general economic outlook in 1972 appears to be brighter in certain areas than the actual picture in the year just past. The currency realignment should bring about an expansion in world trade and an increase in the demand for Philippine exports.\r\nThe government\u2019s program to devote a great deal of its resources to food production and infrastructure that will facilitate production and transportation will result in lower prices which will be to the advantage of the wage earners. In addition, the building of more rural banks will provide the credit for productive rural economic activities.\r\nFor this year\u2019s agenda, the task of development has the second highest priority. As I suggest elsewhere in this message, the maintenance of peace and order is a precondition to the goals of national development. What this means, further, is that it is our desire as soon as practicable to shift most of our expend\u00aditures to the capital requirements of growth, and make this the administration\u2019s principal task. We should therefore endeavor to enhance and harness the productive power of all elements of our society. Those who are not now contributing to production must, in particular, be roused to an awareness of their duty. At the same time, they shall continue to be given the opportunity and the incentives for participating in the nation\u2019s productive effort.\r\nThe frontline of production, as always, consists of the agricultural and the industrial sectors. Concurrent and articulated growth of production in these two areas remain our emphasis; as growth in industrial production proceeds, agri\u00adculture is bound to be influenced in the direction of rationalization, in effect the industrialization of the agricultural process, which I feel will achieve our goals of development.\r\nWe will promote the energetic flow of capital into both agricultural and industrial production. Thus we must try to stem the rising tide of government expenditure, the bulk of which are devoted to operating expenses, and shift\u00a0as\u00a0much of it as possible to capital investment needs of production.\r\nThis year the Central Bank hopes to complete a survey which can lead to an expanded, socially oriented banking system capable of more equitable alloca\u00adtion of resources to all levels of the population. This can be done by increasing the rural banking system, one bank in each municipality for example, with as many stockholders as possible drawn from the community itself.\r\nOn my instructions, efforts have already been started to reverse the trend in the expenditures under the general fund for capital investment and administra\u00adtive operating expenses. Here are the figures.\r\nIn 1971, the current operating expenditures comprised 83% of the general fund, while capital outlay was a mere 12%.\r\nIn FY 1972, we have set aside 86% for current operating expenses, and 14% for capital outlay.\r\nIn FY 1973, we are allotting 82% for current operating expenditures, and 18% for capital outlay.\r\nThis steady upward trend in capital outlays compared to current operating expenditures will, I hope, continue beyond 1973.\r\nAt the same time I have laid new emphasis on the diffusion of the benefits of development. I intend to provide, on as large a scale as the resources available will provide, programs with three objectives:\r\nI shall spell out in detail, in this and later messages, the content of these programs. In the meantime, let me illustrate them by a few examples.\r\nWe shall\r\nprimarily by means of three main programs in the Four-Year Development Plan.\r\nFirst, a massive regional development program, to uplift depressed regions of the country. This will involve the preparation and implementation of a regional development program for each of the country\u2019s 10 regions, and the breaking up of government offices and agencies into regional offices, as specified under the Reorganization Plan. We propose to begin this program with the regions of Mindanao.\r\nSecond, a program implementing a national employment policy. While paying lip service to the principles of labor-intensive production, most of our incentives still tend to favor capital-intensive technology. We shall formulate and implement the program to ensure the highest possible levels of employ\u00adment.\r\nThird, a long-term agricultural procurement and production program, to ensure the masses of the ready and reasonable availability of basic foodstuffs.\r\nThe second category of programs involves\r\nThese include programs for mass low-cost housing and rural electrification. These also include improvement of the basic services the government provides the people, fore\u00admost among which is peace and order. These services, furthermore, must be provided with the utmost efficiency; and I urge the immediate enactment of the proposals contained in the Reorganization Bill.\r\nOur most important programs concern the\r\nI wish to afford to every Filipino the opportunity to live and work, if not in affluence, at least in dignity and self-respect. This he cannot do if he is ill-educated, or jobless, or subservient to landlord or employer.\r\nThe most important of our programs in this category continues to be land reform, which still suffers from lack of funding. I ask Congress to provide this program with the resources the farmers and the country need.\r\nWe have formulated a long-term program to make our educational system more responsive to national needs.\r\nWe have formulated a manpower development program, which includes training and placement services and a manpower center in every municipality.\r\nWe have begun several programs aimed at improving the economic oppor\u00adtunities of the masses through cooperation and self-help. These include livestock dispersal and cooperative farming which harness the energy of our youth, which too often find an outlet instead in wasteful and unproductive violence. This is a powerful force, which can be utilized for the concrete benefit of both the country and the young. Let us together define useful and attractive lines of endeavor; perhaps constructing feeder roads, providing educational and medical services, directing barrio improvement projects, and providing our unemployed and out-of-school youth opportunity to serve their country.\r\nFor the financing of all these programs, I am proposing the creation of a Development Fund, which will receive the proceeds from certain tax measures and direct them towards development projects.\r\nThe pressures for change in our society daily become rarer. It is a process that we not only accept, but seek to master. We at the center of govern\u00adment must not only react to change, but generate it. I have outlined some of the innovations we are seeking to create; I undertake to maintain this innovative approach.\r\nIt is the only way to meet the challenge of revolution.\r\nScientific and applied research explains, in large part, the story of moderniza\u00adtion of progressive countries. I recognize that the promotion of research and development is a universal task of nation-building fostered by the government. Applied research in industry and agriculture will enable us to find new products and uses for our resources. It will encourage a more vibrant and productive climate for our economic future. Academic institutions, research institutes, private industry, and government are enjoined to link together in cooperative efforts. On the part of the government, we are determined to raise more resour\u00adces to support research and development and to make better and more effective use of whatever existing resources we have, like the Science Fund.\r\nSpecial emphasis will also be given to archaeological, anthropological, and historical research. We should foster studies that delve into our ancient roots and help us define our past more clearly; in this connection, we should give more funds and more powers to the National Museum so that it can develop an institution of which we can all be proud.\r\nThe solution to the problem of increasing prices undoubtedly deserves a high place in our priorities. However, it will serve no one to regard the problem with less than a clear mind and an honest purpose. The classic answer to infla\u00adtion is to manage the growth of money supply and at the same time to increase production. We have in fact increased production\u20146.5 GNP in real terms, and moderated growth of money supply from 19% in 1969 to about 7% during the past two years.\r\nThe need to provide the government with better instruments for dealing with supply shortages was revealed again in 1971. There was a rice shortage; and because we could not remedy the gap until the last minute, food prices rose by over 29%. This was largely responsible for the increase of over 23 in the consumer price index.\r\nSome traders also apparently took unwarranted advantage of the situation to increase their margins. Wholesale prices rose by less than 16%, or about 7% less than consumer prices.\r\nExport prices were depressed in relation to other prices. In the face of a price increase of 17% for all domestic products, and in spite of increased costs, wholesale export prices rose by only 6%.\r\nAlso last year, the Price Control Council was reestablished by law to prevent monopoly, hoarding, injurious speculation, manipulation and profiteering with respect to the supply and marketing of commodities. The Council has waged a vigorous campaign against profiteers, blackmarketeers, hoarders, and speculators. It has also prevented what could have been the spiraling of the prices of petroleum products, textiles, textbooks, school supplies, milk, drugs, and construction materials. The task of the Council continues this year.\r\nWe can, and should, produce all the rice and corn our people and our industries need. But government cannot always foresee nor can it always quickly offset the destructive effects of natural calamities, such as those wrought by typhoons and diseases which ruin standing crops.\r\nThis is exactly what happened in 1971, which, on the whole, was a disas\u00adtrous year for Philippine agriculture.\r\nThe havoc wrought by the typhoons of 1970 resulted in a severe rice shortage in 1971, so that the country had to resume rice importations anew after having been self-sufficient for the three previous years. The conflicts that broke out in Cotabato in December of 1970 continued through 1971, thus drastically reducing rice and corn production in one of the major rice bowls of the country. Moreover, the rains that came in the wake of the typhoons cut corn production severely, resulting in a soaring of corn prices. This, in turn, led to a shift to rice by the corn-eating population, thus artificially increasing the demand for rice at a time when supply was already short. Political hysteria in election year 1971 further aggravated the situation by encouraging panic-buying and hoarding. The net result was a steep rise in the price of rice immediately preceding the elections in November, although this was followed by a price decline shortly thereafter.\r\nAs if this were not bad enough, an outbreak of the dreaded\r\ndisease hit the main rice crop unexpectedly towards the end of the year, resulting in drastic production declines in Central Luzon and a few other parts of the country. Coupled with the 1971 typhoons and a continuation of the Cotabato strife, the rice plague means additional importations in 1972, despite an intensified rice production program which has already been mounted.\r\nTo alleviate the rice shortage and to restore the country once more to self-sufficiency, I have taken the following emergency steps.\r\nFirst, I have instructed all the government financial institutions to extend P180 million worth of additional agricultural credit for this\r\nor dry season crop. This should provide farmers with the additional funds required for the higher-priced farm inputs brought about by the 1970 floating rate. For the main crop that is planted in mid-year 1972, we intend to mobilize a total of about P400 million in additional credits from different sources.\r\nSecond, I have instructed the RCA to use about P100 million, generated from our long-term credit purchases of rice, for a price-support program for palay. This should assure our farmers of a sure market for their palay at a profit, thus encouraging increased production.\r\nThird, the Bureau of Plant Industry\u2014acting on my orders\u2014has launched a seed-production drive to produce\r\n-resistant seed varieties to replace the nonresistant varieties. This, together with a massive agricultural information campaign now being conducted by our 4,000 farm technicians, should prevent any recurrence of the rice disease for this year.\r\nFourth, we are redoubling our efforts to irrigate more rice lands. I have approved the purchase and installation of 4,700 more irrigation pumps through\u00adout the country. I have also ordered the release of funds to the National Irriga\u00adtion Administration to enable it to repair communal irrigation systems. Altogether, this should place about 50,000 more hectares under irrigation this year.\r\nFifth, having obtained a World Bank loan of $14.3 million, the Develop\u00adment Bank of the Philippines and the National Food and Agricultural Council have undertaken a PISO-million effort to modernize and upgrade our rice storage and warehousing facilities all over the country.\r\nFinally, I ask Congress again, as I did last year, to pass the bill which will abolish RCA and to create in its stead a more viable National Grains Authority. I also ask Congress to provide sufficient funds to this new agency and to the entire rice industry lest we perpetuate our insufficiency in rice.\r\nWhile these steps are being taken, we have already contracted for more rice abroad\u2014largely on the basis of long-term credit\u2014in order to assure our people of sufficient rice for their needs this year. This should tide us over this critical period.\r\nSo much for rice.\r\nFortunately, not all was bleak in agriculture. While rice overshadowed all other developments, we did forge ahead in many agricultural fields.\r\nCoconut production jumped unexpectedly by almost 40% this year, resulting in vastly increased exports of coconut oil and copra. World prices, however, fell sharply in the face of this substantial increase in exports. We are now therefore vigorously engaged in opening up new markets\u2014including Mainland China and Eastern Communist Countries\u2014for our increased production in order to stabilize world market prices for coconut oil and copra.\r\nWe have accelerated our fish production program. Additional credit, a much-expanded fishery extension force and additional cold storage and marketing facilities enabled us to produce considerably more fish in 1971 than in previous years. We have even begun to export modest but growing quantities of shrimp and other marine products because of this accelerated program.\r\n1971 also saw further advances in our meat-production drive. We dispersed some 4,000 heads of cattle, 4,000 heads of swine, and 200,000 ducklings in 1971. This will result in the rapid upgrading of our local livestock breeds and in the revitalization of our waning duck industry.\r\nWe also launched, for the first time in our history, a milk-production program designed to offset the vastly increased prices of milk and milk products in the world market. The only real answer to increased world prices, as you all know, is to produce the commodity ourselves in order to be less vulnerable to the economic policies of other countries. This we have started to do in this vital commodity\u2014milk.\r\nAs deep as the hunger for food is the hunger for land. We took giant strides in satisfying this hunger in 1971 as a result of a massive land distribution drive. Our Bureau of Lands last year issued 50,158 land patents to small settlers compared to 32,000 the year previous. This represented an increase of fully 56.7% over the previous year. In addition, 1971 was notable as a year when explosive land conflicts disappeared from the front pages of our news\u00adpapers. This was largely a result of the excellent, quiet work undertaken by the Small Farmers\u2019 Commission and by the Presidential Action Committee on Land Problems which I created in August of 1970 to tackle this serious problem.\r\nOur mining and oil exploitation sectors received new boosts from the government last year. We provided credit and other forms of assistance to our nickel projects. We formulated new and liberal guidelines designed to attract badly needed foreign investment into the oil exploration industry. In coopera\u00adtion with foreign entities, we launched new ventures to harness our vast thermal and gas resources for producing power. We began to explore the possibility of new markets for our copper concentrates in the light of a sudden drop in world copper prices. Even now, we are seriously studying the economic feasibility of establishing our own copper smelting facilities to protect our copper industry.\r\nOne of the most important things that we did in 1971 was to establish, after careful studies, the basis for a truly effective forest conservation program. A Presidential Committee on Wood Industry Development, which I created in March of last year with private sector representatives, recommended sweeping reforms in our forestry and conservation policies. I have approved these recom\u00admendations and the stage is now set for the rapid rationalization and develop\u00adment of our wood industries and the protection of our forest resources. In this field too, we will need legislation to institutionalize the recommended reforms. I recommend to Congress the bill that we are now preparing in order to conserve our forest patrimony for our generations to come. Unless we take drastic steps now, we will have reached the point of irreversible descent by 1985. At that point, it will be too late to prevent our rich country from becoming a wasteland.\r\nThis period saw marked advances in the areas of export trade, tourism, cooperatives, and consumer protection.\r\nIn 1970, our total trade rose by 21% over the aggregate export receipts for 1969. Export earnings in manufacturers alone showed remarkable increase, after the adoption of the new exchange rate policy.\r\nAlthough we continue to gain from our recent efforts, developments due to factors not within our control\u2014the international monetary crisis, unfavorable prices for our exports in world markets, strikes in U.S. ports, etc.\u2014slowed down our export expansion.\r\nWe enjoyed a balance of payments surplus of $10 million in 1970. This was attributed largely to the sales of copper concentrates, pineapple in syrup, molasses, plywood, desiccated coconut, and bananas. We would have had a better trade performance on our side if we did not have to import rice and corn in 1971.\r\nThe Department of Commerce and Industry revitalized its commercial intelligence corps; provided a better market structure for the smooth geographical movements of goods and services; and aligned its export promotion program with that of the United Nations Development Program. UNDP has committed itself to assist us in this effort.\r\nRealizing that tourism is vital to our economy, we have given it a special emphasis.\r\nThe DCI is perfecting a plan which would promote tourism in other countries with the help of foreign-based marketing organizations. The target includes the estimated 400,000 Filipino nationals in the United States. This program also calls for the improvement and modernization of entry facilities into our country, at air and major seaports, tourist plants, amusement centers, and recreational parks, and the removal of tax problems that deter Filipinos from coming to their own country either as tourists, investors, returning residents, or plain visitors. With the tragic fire that caught the Manila International Airport last weekend, the rehabilitation of tourism facilities requires high priority for airport development.\r\nWith the expected boost in the tourist industry, it is estimated that some $40 million in revenue can be revitalized for the support of the country\u2019s develop\u00adment program.\r\nThe organization of more consumer and industrial cooperatives by pro\u00adviding incentives in the form of capital required to finance productive enterprises are a requisite complement of the economic development program.\r\nDuring fiscal year 1971, some 447 nonagricultural cooperatives were registered as against 291 for fiscal year 1970, thereby increasing the number of registered cooperatives to 4,917 as of June 30, 1971. For fiscal year 1971, credit union led the number of registration with its 265, followed by consumer cooperatives with 142. For the first half of FY 1971-1972, an additional 208 cooperatives were registered, bringing the total registration to 5,125 as of December 31, 1971.\r\nWe have likewise placed emphasis on the regulation of business enterprises engaged in the sale of goods vital to national growth. The private business sector was drawn into this undertaking to dramatize the importance of con\u00adsumer education. Primers on fair trade laws and practices were disseminated and seminars and lecture forums were conducted in the different parts of the country.\r\nThe performance of the Department of Finance last year was impressive. Increases were registered not only in the revenue collections of both the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs but also in the cash balances in the Bureau of Treasury, in the rate of repayments of public debt, and in the assessments and collections of real property taxes.\r\nThe BIR last year realized a gross collection exceeding the P3 billion marks, representing an increase of 23.2% over that of fiscal year 1969-1970 (P2.084 million). The net collection on the other hand for fiscal year 1970-1971 was P1,581 million or an increase of P243 million or 18.18% over that of fiscal year 1969-1970 (P1,388 million).\r\nFor the current fiscal year, the first semester\u2019s BIR gross collection (July 1 to December 31, 1971) was P1,240 million, an increase of P201 million or 19.34% over that of the first semester last fiscal year (P1,039 million). The corresponding net collection for the same period (July 1 to December 31, 1971) was P844 million, an increase of P158 million or 23.03% over that of the same semester.\r\nThe Bureau of Customs had a gross collection of P1,562 million for calendar year 1971, representing an increase of P355 million or 29.44% over that of the preceding calendar year (P1,207 million). A comparison on the fiscal year basis shows that collections by the Bureau in fiscal year 1971 were P1,378 million, representing an increase of P352 million or 34.34% over that of the preceding fiscal year (P1,026 million). Collection for the first semester of the current fiscal year was P828 million which, compared to that of the first semester of the last fiscal year (P644 million), shows an increase of P184 million or 28.69%.\r\nThe General Fund in the Treasury had a cash balance on June 30, 1971, of P397.66 million which, compared to the balance on June 30, 1970, of P84.64 million, shows an increase of P313.02 million. On December 31, 1971, the cash balance was P249,49 million, showing an increase of P70.3 million over that of December 31, 1970 (P170.19 million).\r\nAssessments of taxable real properly in provinces and cities as of June 30, 1970, add up to P18.617 million, which rose to P19,883 million as of June 30, 1971, representing an increase of P1,266 million. On real property tax collec\u00adtions, the totals are P149 million for fiscal year 1970 and P173 million for fiscal year 1971, showing an increase of P24 million.\r\nThe increased collection of the Bureau has been made possible by the collection through banks which has reduced substantially the issuance of fake receipts by unscrupulous persons; grouping of internal revenue examination by industries; extensive use of collection and assessment data prepared by electronic data processing; improvement of tax audit methods of examination and investigation of internal revenue taxes; collection of delinquent accounts through R.A. No. 5203 or by warrants of distraint and levy.\r\nThe administration has taken an active role in attracting desirable foreign investments into the country\u2019s economy. Among the more successful of these programs is the progressive car manufacturing program. Expressions of serious interest to submit proposals for participation in the progressive car manufactur\u00ading program have been received from domestic assemblers in collaboration with the largest automobile manufacturers in the world. In particular, Ford Motors of the United States has indicated a strong preference for the Philippines as the site of a pioneering car manufacturing program for the Southeast Asia region. Others reported as being interested are General Motors, also of the United States; Toyota and Nissan of Japan; Renault and Volkswagen of Europe. Although the proposals are expected to be submitted at the end of this month, coming from various sources, the indications are that substantial invest\u00adments in manufacturing facilities will be made as part of the program proposals.\r\nSuch bold investment decisions, in response to a climate of confidence that has been engendered, will undoubtedly speed up the industrialization of our country.\r\nIndustrial investment took place in the form of expansion of capacities both in exports and the domestic market industries. Imports of industrial machinery for this purpose exceeded 1970 levels. Manufacturing plants in new industries were also established; the Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines started operations in Bislig, Surigao del Sur, as the first integrated newsprint and Kraft paper plant from wood materials in Southeast Asia; the Filipinas Syn\u00adthetic Fiber Corporation in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, as the first manufacturer of syn\u00adthetic textile fibers in the Philippines; and the Philippine Explosives Corpora\u00adtion in Bataan as the first manufacturer of dynamites and industrial explosives in the country.\r\nConstruction is also going on in Bukidnon of a plant to manufacture high-grade paper from abaca, which will represent an entirely new utilization in the Philippines of a traditional raw material export and stimulate the whole abaca industry.\r\nThe construction of more highways and other public works activities is in line with the government\u2019s goal of providing infrastructure to enhance economic activities.\r\nDuring the last six years, a total of 38,409 kilometers of roads and 30,903 meters of permanent bridges were constructed at a cost of P866 million.\r\nLast year alone, we paved with concrete or asphalt 449 kilometers of roads, constructed 528 kilometers of gravel roads and 3,736 meters of permanent bridges.\r\nNext fiscal year\u2019s program envisions the concrete-paving of 340 kilometers of roads, asphalting of 777 kilometers, and construction of 1,311 kilometers of developmental or feeder roads, and the construction of 5,000 meters of permanent bridges.\r\nWe have accelerated the implementation of the Philippine-Japan Highway Project this fiscal year and we shall speed up work further on the project next year.\r\nIn Mindanao, the construction of roads with great economic value will be started this year. They are the General Santos-Cotabato Road, the Digos (Davao)-Cotabato City Road which will be implemented from a World Bank loan.\r\nThe rehabilitation of the MIA from the disastrous fire a few days ago is our foremost priority for airport development.\r\nEmphasis is also being given to the construction and improvement of air\u00adports throughout the country and the facilities necessary for their operations. To ensure safety of air travel, the government is pursuing the construction of modem air navigation facilities all over the country. We expect to accomplish this important project within the next two years.\r\nLast year, we constructed and improved 75 airports with a total expenditure of P32.4 million. Likewise, we constructed 37 new air navigation facilities, and improved and maintained 95 facilities.\r\nOur program for the next fiscal year involves the continued acquisition and installation of equipment for ongoing projects and the implementation of the $1.0 million Belgian loan for the lighting facilities for the Manila International Airport and 12 trunk line airports.\r\nDuring the last six years, we started three telegraph and radio stations costing P2.1 million. On the nationwide telecommunications expansion and improvement project, we have constructed telephone exchanges, troposcatter, microwave, and high-frequency stations. Phase I of this NTEI project is nearing completion.\r\nWe completed and inaugurated the Bicol microwave link under the NTEI Project. This system is expected to ease up traffic through voice and telegraph circuits between the Bicol Region and Manila and other parts of the country.\r\nWe established high-grade UHF, VHF radio links from Cebu to Western Visayas, particularly to Negros, Iloilo, Capiz, and Aklan. Among the stations commissioned were Kalibo, Roxas, Iloilo, and Bacolod.\r\nWe envision the implementation of the Mindanao Telecommunications Development Project the next fiscal year.\r\nWe have completed 20 additional irrigation project systems in the last six years to increase rice production. These include the Upper Pampanga River Project and the Cotabato Irrigation Project.\r\nNext year, we hope to open up new irrigation systems, including the Magal River Multi-Purpose Project, the construction of communal irrigation systems in places where water resources are limited and the intensified pump irrigation program.\r\nTo provide irrigation water to rice-producing regions which are not yet served by gravity irrigation, the government is pursuing the procurement of irri\u00adgation pumps for sale to small farmers at cost and on long-term basis. We intend to procure more pump units this year. Last year alone, 3,372 pump units were installed which covered 47,062 hectares of agricultural lands.\r\nDuring the last six years, the Bureau of Public Works completed one over\u00adseas berth and three domestic berths to add to our existing shipping facilities. Among the ports we hope to develop this year are the Ports of Manila, Iligan, Davao-Sasa, the Ports of Batangas, Tabaco, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato, and Makar. We shall also accelerate the development of the Navotas Fisheries Port Project.\r\nOn flood control, the government is making arrangements for the im\u00adplementation of the Manila and Suburbs Food Control Project to be financed from the Japanese loan. Negotiations are being made so that a major portion of capital investment for this project can be accommodated from the loan fund and the rest from a local fund. A bill has also been filed in Congress to raise funds for this project.\r\nWe have constructed 20 and improved and repaired 34 national buildings and hospitals, distributed 2,792 and erected 2,016 two-room and three-room units of the Marcos-type school buildings; constructed 216 rooms of non-pre\u00adfabricated school buildings; constructed 110 and repaired and/or improved 626 school and public buildings like home economics and shop buildings, public markets, and libraries; constructed 3,190 meters of seawall protection; dredged to adequate water depth in all national ports, harbors, navigable rivers, and waterways throughout the country; improved the esteros, repaired and improved river walls, pumping stations, and surveys of the Manila and Suburbs Flood Control and Drainage. We have completed the construction of 200 meters of revetment at Calumpit, Bulacan, and 1,356 meters of earth dikes along the Rio Chico River at Aliaga and Licab, in Nueva Ecija.\r\nThe b\r\nWe shall institute further reforms at the Land Transportation Commission in order to intensify its collection efforts. This agency contributes a consider\u00adable amount to the Highway Special Fund which the administration uses to finance infrastructure development projects.\r\nIn the last six fiscal years, the LTC has collected P501,355,369 in revenues, of which P451,093,877 went to the Highway Special Fund.\r\nWe have procured a plate-making plant from Japan through reparations which, during the fiscal year of operation, contributed to the national treasury a total of P933,392. The plate manufacturing plant of the LTC is advantageous not only because it has prevented tampering of plates but also has simplified fund accounting.\r\nThe tourism industry has grown consistently during the last decade. Tourist traffic increased from 50,657 visitor arrivals in 1960 to 144,071 in 1970, equi\u00advalent to a growth rate of 11.2% annually. Excepting 1962, tourism receipts, which were estimated at $2.9 million in 1960, increased steadily to a high level of $97.8 million in 1970. The tourist industry was the fourth top dollar earner in 1970, the total dollar receipts from the industry exceeding the value of total export shipment of coconut oil. The total receipts that year constituted about 9% of the total export proceeds and 36.8% of the total invisible receipts in 1970. There have been other encouraging develop\u00adments since.\r\nThe Development Bank of the Philippines lent P10 million to build addi\u00adtional hotels.\r\nIn addition, we are building youth hotels in 12 selected areas. This is in support of the youth travel program, which forms an important segment of domestic tourism program. This program anticipates a shortage of 851 rooms by 1974 and approximately 1,800 rooms by 1975. Additional hotel rooms now under construction are expected to meet such shortages.\r\nOur current plans call for an outlay of P3.7 billion for infrastructure development designed to meet the priorities of tourism development.\r\nInfrastructure facilities invariably improve the climate for more tourist investment. These include roads and highways, bridges, water systems, airports\u2014all essential parts of the Four-Year Development Plan.\r\nBilateral agreements with foreign countries pursuant to the open skies policy enunciated a couple of years ago seek to generate additional airline frequencies which would bring more visitors into the country. Consequently, promotional efforts in the various travel markets of the world may now be ex\u00adpanded to generate a massive flow of tourist traffic to the Philippines.\r\nI am pleased to report that the National Economic Council has recom\u00admended the use of $1 million out of the Japanese reparations programs to double our efforts to attract a greater number of Japanese visitors to the Philip\u00adpines. This effort will also be extended to the Australian and European continents as our financial resources become adequate.\r\nThe participation of the private sectors is indispensable in the overall tourist development and promotion efforts. It is my earnest hope that the various elements of the private sector will continue to cooperate with the national tourist organizations in promoting and developing our tourist industry.\r\nIn the field of investment incentives for the tourism industry, there are areas where the government can fully assist in development and promotion. These areas being explored include repatriation and remittance of earnings, capital gains, tax exemptions, and tax allowances for special investments in tourist plant projects and services. It is my hope that this will eventually attract foreign investments in the Philippine tourism industry.\r\nI appeal for congressional support in the enactment of appropriate legisla\u00adtive measures intended to liberalize certain existing tax burdens which discourage the return of Filipino residents in foreign countries. This may also bring about the entry of the much needed foreign exchange for capital require\u00adments. Within the framework of existing laws, the executive agencies of the government have substantially effected the remedial administrative measures but Congress can help in this effort through the enactment of concrete and specific provisions of law.\r\nOne major focus of development under this administration was the barrio. In stressing rural development, we ran afoul of a school of economic thought that asserted that development programs at the barrio level should have the last priority. I disagreed with this thinking because the barrios are the backbone of our nation and their uplift and development is a precondition of the national progress.\r\nDuring the past six years we have initiated a number of successful projects for the rural areas. It was during this administration that the barrios were en\u00adfranchised politically; we now seek to enfranchise them economically.\r\nEconomic disparities exist not only among social classes but among regions of the country; and the latter is as great an evil as the former.\r\nThis past year, we have emphasized and accelerated our regional develop\u00adment planning work to reduce the income gaps in the different regions of the country. The objective of our regional development program is to bring down from the national to the regional level the overall goals and targets formulated by the national planning agencies for easier translation into appropriate projects.\r\nLast December I directed the Presidential Economic Staff to assume the additional functions of formulating plans and guidelines on regional development and to coordinate all national government efforts pertaining to regional development. To carry out these functions, there has been created within the PES a regional development monitoring and planning system to serve as the basic organizational framework for a more realistic and effective regional development planning work in the country.\r\nWe are also setting up government administrative centers in all regions of the country. I have directed all national government branches and offices in one region to locate their branch offices in one strategic area or city in the interest of efficiency, expediency, and economy.\r\nOur goal of wider income distribution necessarily calls for regional dis\u00adpersal of industries to prevent undue concentration of economic activity in just one area and to spread the benefits of economic development throughout the country. To this end, the Board of Investments has launched an investment promotion drive in the provinces. This is in line with the regional dispersal concept of the fourth investment priorities plan as developed by the BOI.\r\nThis year we will create, tentatively by executive order, an Office of Local Government and Community Development. I ask Congress to firm this up with the proper legislation.\r\nThis Office will be service and development-oriented and it will have the following functions:\r\nThrough this department, we will involve the local governments in all aspects of the development planning and we will give substance to the policy of local autonomy.\r\nThe idea of an office or department of local government and community development was endorsed unanimously by the Governors and City Mayors League.\r\nVast areas of our country are still denied a vital mark of modernization: electric power. For this reason, these areas\u2014and their people\u2014are cut off from the main current of development and growth. They are unable to tap their potential for irrigation, mechanization, cottage industries, and agro-industrial activities which are necessary to raise the quality of life in those areas.\r\nRealizing all this, I have made rural electrification a priority program of my administration.\r\nIn 1971, through the National Electrification Administration, we com\u00adpleted and energized 35 municipal electric systems, and set in motion the construction of 38 rural electric cooperative systems. Initially, we expanded the Victorias Rural Electric Service Cooperative System in Negros Occidental and energized the Misamis Electric Service Cooperative System in Mindanao. These two cooperative systems alone now provide, on a 24-hour basis, electric service to some 10,000 homes in 14 municipalities. For the 36 other systems, groundwork has been prepared last year, including the drawing up of feasibility studies, organization and registration of electric cooperatives, and the finalization of loan agreements amounting to P182 million. The completion of these 36 rural electric cooperative systems will provide low-cost power to some 6 million people in our rural areas.\r\nUnder our Four-Year Development Plan, we are called upon to build 186 powerhouses, 193 generating units, and 193 transmission systems during the next four years, which altogether will cost us P94 million from local sources and $7 million from foreign sources.\r\nI now ask Congress to join us, by enacting the necessary laws in funding our program for the liberation of our vast rural areas from darkness, backwardness, and impotence.\r\nFor a long time we have assumed that employment is an automatic con\u00adsequence of development, that as we ascend the ladder of progress, unemployment decreases. Our experience, however, has shown that this is not always true. We have found out that it is possible to attain higher levels of growth with\u00adout any significant consequences on employment, unemployment, and under\u00ademployment.\r\nWe have concluded that to meet the problem of unemployment or under\u00ademployment, national plans have to be given an employment orientation. We have therefore given our new Four-Year Development Plan a strong employ\u00adment bias.\r\nOur major efforts in employment promotion are manpower training and development, the stimulation of cottage industries, rural employment, and special preference for labor-intensive industries and economic activities.\r\nIn my State of the Nation message last year, I directed the National Man\u00adpower and Youth Council to fit the accelerated manpower training program to the requirements of industry.\r\nThis we have nearly achieved. We have successfully modified the accel\u00aderated manpower program by instituting more stringent controls and by aligning its training projects to the needs of industry and the national economy.\r\nLast year, the total output of all our training projects was 65,242 trainees. Of these, 33,205 were trained in the accelerated manpower training project; 27,037 were trained in out-of-school youth projects; and 5,000 were given skills upgrading and instructor training. The total cost of these projects was P9,781,789.66.\r\nSome 45% of these trainees were employed in industry, and 30% became self-employed after training. As an employment strategy, therefore, the manpower development program is proving to be effective.\r\nThis year, we shall launch an accelerated manpower training program in agricultural skills and cottage industries to buoy up employment in the rural sector, to increase food production, and to raise the productivity of farmworkers.\r\nWe shall begin initially by setting up an agricultural training center in every province. Gradually, as the need arises, we will expand training operations down to the municipal and the barrio levels.\r\nFor this purpose, we shall utilize existing agricultural schools and the training facilities of all government agencies. This program will be a major undertaking of the National Manpower and Youth Council, the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Department of Education, and the NACIDA.\r\nWe shall offer courses in handicrafts, rice and corn production, poultry and cattle raising, animal husbandry, and such other agricultural skills as would promote production and employment on a self-help basis.\r\nThis agricultural training program will be a desirable complement of our accelerated industrial training program. The development of skilled manpower in our urban and rural areas will continue to occupy a high priority in my program of government. It is, in my view, an important component of our total development strategy.\r\nThe strategy of economic development we have been pursuing has revolved around the development and strengthening of the agricultural sector so that the increasing purchasing power of our agricultural producers and their families would provide a mass market for the products of our industries.\r\nThe major emphasis we have given to the expansion of our irrigation facilities has been geared to this end.\r\nThe advances we have made in the agricultural sector have broadened our horizons and raised our hopes. Through the DANR and the NFAC, we have moved to diversify our agricultural activities so as to produce a greater variety of crops and livestock. Behind all these initiatives is our desire to provide year-round employment opportunities to our rural people. Irrigation provides oppor\u00adtunities for diversification and in turn provides for greater utilization of the available labor force on farm.\r\nTo generate additional employment opportunities in our rural areas, we have created the Committee on Rural Employment (CORE) headed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.\r\nThe stimulation of cottage industries will provide people in the rural areas with employment opportunities that should raise their living standards.\r\nUnder the Four-Year Development Plan, \u201ccottage industry is specified as a priority because it is directly linked with the objectives of labor-intensity. Furthermore, it provides service to large scale business that finds it less econo\u00admical to undertake certain intermediate processes.\u201d\r\nFrom 1962 to 1970, the average yearly increase of our exports of cottage industry products was 29% as against the average 10% exports growth target. This started with a meager volume of P16.7 million in 1962 to P128.9 million in 1970.\r\nCottage industries will be greatly influenced by the decision of the ECAFE second preparatory meeting to establish the Asian Handicraft Center in Manila. The Philippines will provide the site and the building while the international agencies and ECAFE member-countries will assist in the maintenance and operation of the center.\r\nTo meet this development imperative, the NAClDA has to be restructured and provided with adequate facilities, funds, and personnel to undertake extension work, to establish the Asian Handicraft Center, to have more realistic credit and financing programs, and to undertake an aggressive promotion and marketing of cottage products both here and abroad.\r\nWe have also created a Cottage Industries Development Enterprise. The main objectives of the CIDE program are (1) to integrate and coordinate all institutional activities related to cottage industries; (2) to generate employment opportunities in depressed urban areas and in the rural areas; and (3) to create small business opportunities with low capital investments.\r\nThe initial phase of operation is centered around an extensive training program to be conducted by the National Manpower and Youth Council in close coordination with the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Educa\u00adtion, and the NACIDA. This will be followed by the organization or production cooperatives with the trainees as their members. These cooperatives will be assisted by the CIDE not only in getting volume orders but also in financing their raw material acquisition. At the same time, the CIDE will embark on an extensive product development and promotion effort. To finance its initial operations we have released to the CIDE the amount of P1,006,000.\r\nOur experience in agrarian reform in 1971 showed one thing: Our farmers became more efficient and more productive when placed under the liberating umbrella of agrarian reform. Land reform areas have consistently shown marked increase in general productivity and in gross incomes compared with non-land reform areas.\r\nEncouraged by this experience, we made substantial gains in land reform in 1971. Leasehold now embraces 236 municipalities in 20 provinces, and covers 30% of all provinces, and 40% of all tenanted palay farms, or approximately a total of 182,000 tenant farmers and their families. Last year also, the Land Bank financed the acquisition of 9,600 hectares benefiting some 4,463 families.\r\nLast year, we streamlined our agrarian reform machinery with the establish\u00adment of the Department of Agrarian Reform. We removed some impeding defects of the land reform code and poured more money in the Land Bank. We provided for the automatic conversion of all share-tenants into leasehold. At the University of the Philippines, we established an Agrarian Reform Institute. Moreover, we helped organize direct working relationships between the universities and various farming communities, thus establishing a vital link between our educational system and land reform. We also encouraged the active participation of various groups in land reform activities, such as private foundations, educational institutions, local governments, and even religious groups. Some of these groups are now deeply involved in such projects as the Magalang Cooperative Settlement Project, the Tarlac-Pampanga Resettlement Projects, and the government resettlement projects in Agusan.\r\nWe also witnessed last year the increasing militancy of farm workers. Some of them in pursuit of land justice were jailed\r\n\r\ne in Davao, Tarlac, Negros, and Laguna. We shall continue to encourage the organization of farm workers into unions and cooperatives in order to enable them to participate more meaningfully in land reform. Unorganized, farm workers are impotent; organized, they are a real force\u2014perhaps, the decisive propelling force behind land reform.\r\nLast year, Congress put more money in the Land Bank, but that is not enough. With the automatic conversion of all share-tenants into leasehold, we urgently need more funds this year, especially in the form of farm credit for the newly emerged leaseholders. If we do not provide these funds, leasehold may turn out to be a major disappointment.\r\nLand consolidation projects will be undertaken by the Department of Agra\u00adrian Reform on acquired private agricultural landed estates to maximize the utilization of farm lands and to generate increase in productivity at the lowest production cost. Under this scheme, a number of irrigation projects and infra\u00adstructure facilities will be constructed.\r\nFeasibility studies are now being undertaken by the Department of Agrarian Reform in coordination with the Presidential Economic Staff for foreign financial assistance needed in the land development and improvement of 22 settlement projects. These settlements have an aggregate area of 423,012 hectares benefiting 24,634 settler-families.\r\nTo tap the latent creative energies of our people, especially in the rural areas, we need a mechanism to unify integrate and direct their scattered resources; human, moral, and material. This mechanism is the cooperative.\r\nAs we all know, the cooperative is not new to us. During the last two decades, we have been promoting it with financial and technical support in many fields: marketing, credit, farming, and others. However, the cooperative has yet to assume in our society the decisive role it has played in the development of other societies.\r\nTo stimulate the formation of cooperatives, we will, starting this year, use a part of the Rural Improvement Fund as seed capital for rural cooperatives. In this way, we will separate gainful economic activities such as fisheries, cattle raising, vegetable farming, cottage industries, etc.\r\nA review of cooperative development, on the policy, program, and adminis\u00adtrative levels, is imperative if we are to profit from this approach to develop\u00adment. On the policy level, I propose the following:\r\nWe have intensified our community development program in the past 12 months. The main feature of this program is the close cooperation between the barrio people and local governments and national technical agencies.\r\nFor the FY 1971, the following were accomplished:\r\nWe will continue to emphasize this people-government partnership for development in the ensuing years, with the total resources of the PACD concentrated on solving major problems in the rural areas.\r\nWith 26,000 barrios in the country now under the operational coverage of capable PACD fieldsmen, community development will continue to be a priority program of the Administration.\r\nThe Development Bank of the Philippines has launched its countryside development program which will give maximum financing assistance to economic activities in the rural areas. These include farming, cottage industries, small-scale industries, and other projects that will hasten the development of the rural areas, create employment, and generate higher incomes.\r\nFor this countryside development program, the DBP has set aside P300 million to be lent this calendar year. The assistance will be given primarily to small- and medium-size enterprises.\r\nThis program marks the resumption by the DBP of its traditional role as a catalyst of growth and development. In the past two years, the DBP had to curtail its operations because its resources were used to pay our foreign obliga\u00adtions, most of them guarantees in behalf of private industries and enterprises.\r\nAt the start of 1971 these obligations stood at $410 million. Through judi\u00adcious husbanding of its resources and by intensifying the collection of receivables, the DBP succeeded in reducing this exposure by $163 million by the end of the year, meeting its bills as they fell due and thus preserving its credit stand\u00ading abroad. The most pressing foreign obligations have now been paid off, and the DBP is fully confident of retiring the remaining accounts as they become due.\r\nWith these projects and programs we can accelerate rural development. The main thrust of this development effort is to bring the benefits of growth and progress to the rural masses.\r\nThe problem of peace and order is closely linked with the problem of housing.\r\nWe need 470,000 dwellings a year: 100,000 in the cities and 370,000 in the rural areas. This means building 10 to 12 dwellings a year per 1,000 people, but unfortunately our dwelling construction averaged only two to three units a year per 1,000 people during the last 10 years.\r\nThis statistical statement hardly projects the human significance of our housing problem. In human terms the problem means sprawling squatter areas\u2014vast pockets of poverty, ignorance, and disease which debase, pervert, and stultify their inhabitants. According to recent studies, our squatter areas \u2014 in general, lack of adequate and decent housing\u2014account for a large percentage of crimes and criminals in our country.\r\nWe have taken decisive steps to meet this problem. Through the GSIS, we launched last year 16 housing projects covering an area of 843 hectares. These will produce in three years a total of 35,755 urgently needed low-cost dwellings. The bulk of these dwellings is within the P12,000 to P22,000 price range, although some higher-cost units were included to provide a healthy \u201csocial mix\u201d to our projects.\r\nCalling for a total commitment of P616 million, of which P55 million have been released, these GSIS housing projects are in Rizal, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna, Quezon City, Davao City, Pampanga, Bacolod City, Bataan, Bohol, Legaspi City, Naga City, Camarines Sur, Cebu City, and Tacloban City,\r\nThese GSIS housing units which cost relatively less as a result of mass construction are given to GSIS members without equity or down payment and are amortized in 15, 20, or 25 years at 6%, 7%, or 8% interest per annum, respectively.\r\nWith its improved cash collection rate\u2014a monthly increase of 45% in 1971 over the previous year\u2014we expect the GSIS to sustain at an accelerat\u00ading pace its housing projects. The GSIS allocates P200 million a year for housing.\r\nThrough the PHHC, we have also programmed the construction of 44,521 dwellings covering 2,299.74 hectares at a cost of P520.50 million. However, due to lack of funds, only 13,500 dwellings are now in various stages of construction, the rest being still in the pipeline. These are mainly low-cost dwellings for our low-income workers, in government as well as in the private sector.\r\nThrough the National Housing Corporation, we built last year 608 bunk houses to accommodate some 2,000 families who lost their dwellings in a big fire. The NHC operates a complex plant, worth P64 million, which mass produces porous concrete planes, chip boards, and woodworks.\r\nThe SSS housing loan program until December 31, 1967, had not brought about the widest opportunity for home owners especially among the low-income SSS members. Upon my instructions, the SSS beginning in 1968 launched a group housing program for the benefit of its low-income members. The substantial economies of scale realized in group housing as well as certain other advantages has encouraged a number of land developers to participate in the program. Participants\u2019 housing projects are located all over the country from Marikina in the Greater Manila Area to Davao City in Mindanao. In group housing alone, total releases covering the period September 1968 to December 1971 reached P44,848,828 covering 2,419 completed housing units.\r\nThis year, the SSS will further intensify its housing program by giving top priority to the construction of group mass workers housing. The SSS, upon my instructions, has allocated the amount of P200 million for the purpose.\r\nUnder our Four-Year Development Plan, we are called upon to build 117,000 housing units which will cost us P1.97 billion. This huge sum will be drawn from the following: 89.66% from government financing institutions, 7.48% from foreign borrowings, 1.98% from PHHC corporate surplus, 0.7% from taxes, and 0.18% from bonds.\r\nI now ask Congress, which has yet to allocate a single centavo for housing, to enact the necessary laws to enable us to finance our urgent, massive housing need.\r\n1971 was a lively year in the field of labor.\r\nDespite unsettling factors, such as the election campaign, price shifts, and the radicalizing effect of activism, the basic stability of industrial relations established under the Magna Carta of Labor during the last 18 years prevailed.\r\nOut of 1,051 strike able cases handled by the Labor Department, only 129 exploded into actual strikes. At the year\u2019s end, only six strike cases remained unsettled. In other words, 922 labor disputes involving 232,633 workers were settled amicably short of strikes and lockouts. Moreover, the department helped negotiate 181 collective bargaining agreements, providing some P250 million in additional wages and other benefits to over 1 million workers.\r\nOrganized labor achieved new gains. Some 644 new labor unions were registered, raising the number of registered labor organizations to 6,400 all over the country. At the same time, the registration certificates of 317 unions were cancelled.\r\nLimited resources and the suspension of enforcement activities during the election campaign and the Christmas season did not deter effective enforcement of labor laws. Through regular and special enforcement campaigns, the depart\u00adment in 1971 effected restitutions totaling P2.7 million to 30,400 workers, representing back wages, underpayments, overtime pay, and other benefits. In addition, P24.7 million was paid to beneficiaries in 14,420 compensation cases, while workers were helped to secure maternity leave benefits amounting to P138,108.\r\nThe department continued to assist more than 95,000 Filipino workers in U.S. military bases in the Philippines and over 16,000 Filipino workers in U.S. military bases in Southeast Asia and in the Pacific area. The department helped relocate workers displaced by the closure of Sangley Point, the de-escalation of the Vietnam War and the accelerating overall reductions in force in U.S. military establishments the world over.\r\nIn the year ahead, we propose to increase the budget of the Department of Labor to enable it to act effectively as the social conscience of the government.\r\nWe also propose the creation of a Workers Bank, the establishment of an Unemployment Insurance System, the merger of the Court of Industrial Rela\u00adtions and the Court of Agrarian Relations into a nationwide system of labor courts, the resurrection of the Office of Public Defenders under the Department of Labor to provide free legal assistance to indigent workers, the creation of a Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor, the inclusion of labor relations courses in appropriate levels of the educational system, the funding of a mass labor education program under the Department of Labor, and the enact\u00adment of a labor code.\r\nOur democratic revolution aims to give the common man, the most numerous sector of our nation, an effective voice in government. In keeping with this philosophy, I propose to give organized labor representation in all government-owned or -controlled corporations and in the judiciary, including the Court of Industrial Relations, the Court of Agrarian Relations, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. I will do this as appropriate opportunities arise starting this year.\r\nThere is a new agitation for the upward revision of the minimum wage. I think, however, that we should give the Wage Commission, which I estab\u00adlished last year under R.S. 6129, a chance to work out a rational system of industry-wide minimum wages based on voluntary agreement of labor and management, or on an actual study of the objective factors which are normally considered in wage-fixing.\r\nUp to now, our efforts at raising the minimum wages have been political acts, emergency measures not based on a facile, objective consideration of the realities relevant to wage determination. I think it is time we departed from this irrational, dislocating, and costly practice. I have, therefore, asked the Wage Commission to step up its activities and demonstrate, as soon as possible, the workability of its functions. I understand simultaneous wage studies of various industries are now going on and I expect concrete results soon.\r\nIn 1971, our social welfare program benefited more than 12.5 million distressed persons all over the country.\r\nThrough the Department of Social Welfare, the government helped train and place 27,265 persons in gainful jobs, provided various material assistance to 28,000 families; enrolled 53,284 families in family life education; gave homes and parental care to 6,796 children; extended emergency relief and reha\u00adbilitation services to 540.170 families, including some 340,000 Muslim and Christian refugees in Mindanao; and gave various forms of assistance to 766,000 squatter families.\r\nThis year, we intend to intensify and expand our welfare programs, which have a self-help basis. We will also encourage private participation at all appro\u00adpriate levels of our total welfare endeavors. Our aim is to tide over the depressed sectors of our population while we stimulate and promote the habits of self-help, raise productivity, and encourage responsible participation in family and community affairs.\r\nNational development requires bold innovations in our educational system. Education must be transformed so that it can become an instrument for the eco\u00adnomic and social transformation of the nation.\r\nAs the new decade opened, therefore, we reviewed thoroughly our educa\u00adtional system with the aim of relating it firmly to national development goals.\r\nA national survey of education conducted by the Presidential Commission to Survey Philippine Education was completed in late 1970. The commission\u2019s recommendations contained in its education survey report submitted to me early in 1971 have provided the basic guidelines to the reforms of education.\r\nThe commission concluded that although we have achieved universal edu\u00adcation in the Philippines, education is not linked to development. Planning and policy making in education are exercises in solipsism. We must now make education policies dovetail with development policies.\r\nOur educational system must, therefore, undergo a change in its goals, contents, methods, and structure to become relevant to a changed and changing society.\r\nWe must change the curricula and the standards of admission and instruc\u00adtion at all levels. To meet middle-level manpower needs, we should put more stress on technical and vocational training as well as on science and techno\u00adlogical education.\r\nOur system of higher education must be made more coherent. The public university system should be reorganized to avoid proliferation of institutions and unnecessary and expensive duplication of courses. Grants-in-aid and other incentives schemes must be developed to improve the private colleges and universities and to induce them to align their policies and efforts with the over\u00adall development plan of the country.\r\nAt the same time, the administrative structure of the Department of Educa\u00adtion must be improved. We must strengthen the agencies involved in educational planning and research. We must have better coordination so that we can use our facilities and resources more efficiently. Lastly, we must devise a system of administrative decentralization that will make educational programs more responsive to the regional and local conditions and problems within the context of our national goals.\r\nMajor development projects in a number of critical reform sectors of education have been developed by the Education Department assisted by a special education task force that I created early this year. The projects have been proposed for external financing primarily by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The projects include: (1) research and development schools assigned to generate the basis for a desirable curriculum for\u00a0 secondary education, the level that serves the foundation for technical and\u00a0 higher education and for employment; (2) technical institutes, upgrading of trade schools and manpower training centers, to expand and upgrade vocational technical education and skills training; (3) science education centers to train science and mathematics teachers and to upgrade the substance and methods of\u00a0 science teaching at both the elementary and secondary levels; and (4) agricultural colleges and agricultural vocational high schools to make agricultural education support our efforts to spur agricultural productivity.\r\nIn another direction, recognizing the major role of private education, we are considering policy measures that will enable us to allocate public funds in support of programs of private schools that directly contribute to manpower development in key areas and to improvement of educational quality.\r\nSimultaneous with our human resources development program, we should explore and develop ways of encouraging athletics and physical fitness. I will create by executive order a Council on Physical Fitness which will conduct studies and develop projects for the promotion of athletics and physical fitness.\r\nAt the same time, we will give fresh impetus to physical education in the public and private schools. Physical education has been sadly neglected. I am thinking of appointing within the framework of the reorganization plan an Undersecretary for Physical Education.\r\nThe implementation of reform measures in education will have deep implications and consequences for many sectors of our society. We con\u00adtemplate legislative measures to provide the authority and the money to carry out such reforms. We will, therefore, submit to Congress a major educational development program.\r\nBoth the incidences of diseases and the death rate have declined signi\u00adficantly, particularly among infants and mothers. However, communicable diseases continue to be a major problem.\r\nThis relative improvement in health conditions was brought about by the strengthening expansion of the basic health services, particularly through the rural health units and hospital program; the intensified activities directed towards the prevention and control of diseases through health education; the improvement of the general environmental conditions prevailing in the country;\u00a0greater concern for nutritional needs of the population; and the continuous sur\u00adveillance over food, drugs, and cosmetics.\r\nAs part of our long-range hospital development program, 32 emergency and provincial hospitals were established, and facilities in existing hospitals updated and improved. The number of beds increased from 18,275 to 19,725, or an increase of 1,450 beds. Operational expenditures of government hospitals likewise have increased from P49 million to P97 million.\r\nThe medical assistance program undertaken jointly by the Philippine Medical Association and the Department of Health established it first commu\u00adnity health center and hospital in Talavera, Nueva Ecija. Medical assistance councils now operate in Nueva Ecija, Davao del Sur, Cebu, and Capiz.\r\nIn the next four years, the Department of Health will give emphasis to family planning, environmental sanitation, expansion of rural services, medi\u00adcal care, control of communicable diseases, and regulation of food and drugs.\r\nWe have accelerated the administration of justice especially for the masses. We have vigorously prosecuted cases involving government officials, including officials of the Rice and Corn Administration, City and Municipal Mayors, as well as officials and employees of the Department of Justice.\r\nWe have broken up the fake passport and fake visa racket against applicants for overseas employment. Similarly, we have collaborated fully with the COMELEC in the investigation and prosecution of election offenses.\r\nHousecleaning in the Department of Justice has also been undertaken, resulting in the removal from the service of an Assistant Provincial Fiscal, suspension of a Provincial Fiscal, and the dismissal of several division chiefs and assistant chiefs.\r\nThe Office of Agrarian Counsel last year created task force \u201cHukom\u201d for the immediate disposal of pending cases in connection with the special operation for the integrated development of Nueva Ecija.\r\nIn 1971, the Bureau of Prisons transferred from the New Bilibid Prison to the penal colonies a total of 3,702 prisoners to minimize congestion and the incidence of riots.\r\nThe National Bureau of Investigation quietly but effectively performed its role particularly in the campaign against narcotics addiction.\r\nAlso in 1971, the Bureau of Immigration streamlined the procedure for the clearance of passengers which accounted for the increase in passenger traffic by 86,000 passengers over last year. While it relaxed the entry requirements for tourists, it also activated its intelligence section to monitor the activities of aliens.\r\nThe Court of Industrial Relations disposed of 207 cases as a court of appellate jurisdiction. As a court performing trial functions, it handled and terminated 1,229 cases.\r\nThe Court of Tax Appeals gave more emphasis to laying down precedents on taxation rather than on the disposition of routine cases, in line with the policy of giving preference to cases of first impression in this jurisdiction, cases which are complicated in nature, cases which involve borderline and untouched problems, and cases which involved huge sums of money.\r\nThe Anti-Dummy Board doubled the number of cases recommended for prosecution and filed as many cases in court as in the last fiscal year.\r\nOn the other hand, the Court of Agrarian Relations achieved a record high in the number of cases handled and disposed exceeding that of the past year.\r\nThe pace of reforestation is too slow. On the side of the government, there is not enough money for wider and faster reforestation work. On the side of the loggers, I suspect that their interest in reforestation is less than wholehearted.\r\nWe will therefore increase the administrative fees on logging so that we will have a fund for reforestation. This, however, will not exempt the loggers from the obligation to reforest their concession areas.\r\nSide by side with reforestation, we will encourage tree farming, especially the planting of fast-growing species like the\r\nand the Mindoro pine tree. We will also encourage the planting of chinchona trees so that we can add quinine to our list of export products.\r\nPollution is not yet a grave problem in the Philippines; this, however, should not make us complacent.\r\nWe are fast becoming industrialized. In a number of years, pollution will become a menace unless we do something about it now.\r\nWe will set up a Center for Pollution Control and Research.\r\nIn our industrialization plans and in the evaluation and approval of industrial projects, we should require pollution control devices.\r\nWe should look into the effects of industrial and agricultural chemicals on the environment and control their use if they are found to be harmful.\r\nThe rate of wildlife and marine life destruction in our country is shocking. Some species of wildlife and marine life have disappeared and many on the verge of extinction. We will increase our efforts in wildlife and marine life con\u00adservation.\r\nIn all this, we need the full cooperation of everyone. This is a program that should awaken the idealism of every Filipino because it relates ultimately to our place in the scheme of God and nature.\r\n1971 was, for the minorities, a year of hope in the face of many challenges.\r\nPolitical wars and exploitation stalked our Muslim brothers in the south. Among other minority groups, there was increased demand for government recognition and assistance.\r\nBut we have responded actively to these demands, and even anticipated the problems. We pursued the integration of our cultural minorities into the national mainstream with greater vigor.\r\nLand, education, health, relief, and development were the primary concerns of the government, acting through the Commission on National Integration, in the hope of forging a meaningful and lasting national unity among our people and raising the quality of life of our cultural minorities.\r\nThe Commission on National Integration, notwithstanding its limited budget, supported 3,552 students in 1971 with a total appropriation of P2,800,000.\r\nEight pensionados were enrolled in universities abroad. Scholarships for social work were granted to deserving members. An exchange program for CNI scholars was sponsored by the commission to enable the minorities in the north to know more about the minorities in the south, and vice versa.\r\nTo assist the CNI pensionados, a book and library program was carried out with the assistance of the Asia Foundation and USMIP.\r\nThe commission also maintained 12 settlements in operation in 1971 with a total budget of P100,000.\r\nThe CNI as part of the National Minorities Assistance Council (NAMAC) undertook a settlement and tribe development program with emphasis on infra\u00adstructure, land ownership, health, and agricultural, economic, and educational development.\r\nThe CNI also conducted last year a research program with the aid of other agencies to secure necessary information on the minorities. This included the agricultural-economic survey of Negrito/Aeta tribes in Zambales, the summer exchange program, the CNI-Asia Foundation program for elementary schools in cultural minority areas, and the library and book program.\r\nThe Commission on National integration assisted minorities in the solution of their legal problems through its corps of trial lawyers. The legal division should be expanded for the increased protection of the rights and freedoms of our cultural minorities.\r\nI wish to reiterate the policy of the administration of encouraging invest\u00adments in agriculture and industry below the typhoon belt.\r\nThe present conflicts in the Muslim areas which are largely the result of social and economic conditions have prompted me to create a special task force base in Mindanao, with the specific mission of seeking a better understanding of the problem engendered by those conflicts.\r\nThis is the reason most of the loans obtained from the Asian Development Bank are earmarked for Mindanao development and the principal World Bank loan is intended for the completion of the Cotabato-Digos road.\r\nIt shall be my policy to increase the number of Muslims in the Armed Forces, both among the officers and the enlisted personnel. There shall also be greater participation of the Muslims in government.\r\nThe policy of government has been to integrate all cultural minorities. However, there has been a modification of this policy with respect to the tribes that have wanted to maintain the purity of their culture. Thus, it has been necessary to establish special settlements for them. It may be necessary to adopt such a policy for some parts of the Muslim provinces.\r\nI have in mind those of our Muslim brothers who, for various reasons, including that of refusal to be subjugated by alien forces of conquest, cannot be easily integrated into the rest of Philippine society. These usually have less capability to adjust themselves to the national life. Yet, in the effort to integrate them, many Muslims have been deprived of their patrimony, including their ancestral lands. We must now redress this injustice committed them.\r\nWe congratulate the Muslim leaders for taking the initiative themselves to join hands with one another notwithstanding political differences, and for cooperating with government in making settlement efforts possible in critical areas,\r\nThe same thing is true of other cultural minorities.\r\nWhile I am President, I pledge that the Muslims will not be treated as second-class citizens in their own country but shall instead be given the priority in the development of Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan.\r\nI call upon Muslim scholars to participate actively in the study and solution of problems in the Muslim areas.\r\nWe have taken steps to improve the government\u2019s auxiliary service program to make it more responsive to our needs and make it conform to our Four-Year Development Program.\r\nWe are continuously looking for approaches to achieve a more efficient, prudent, economical, and responsive auxiliary service program in the government.\r\nAlong this line, we have streamlined our supply procurement processes and have placed emphasis on the procurement of locally made articles and on the provision of low-cost textbooks.\r\nWe have also commenced the building program in the 120-hectare national government center site in Quezon City to achieve the goal of maximum auxiliary service or \u201chousekeeping efficiency\u201d at least cost.\r\nSimilarly, the Department of General Services has stepped up the replace\u00adment of obsolete printing equipment with more efficient models to cope with the yearly rising printing needs of the government.\r\nTo preserve important and original documents for history, the DGS has intensified the archival preservation program through microfilming, photography, lamination, and other duplicating processes.\r\nThe government bureaucracy has become so vast and unwieldy that it is no longer an effective instrument of development. Furthermore, the government service has become graft-ridden and government employees have lost sight of the larger goals of public service.\r\nWe should begin a massive retraining program for government employees. The purpose of this retraining is to make government employees more efficient, more perceptive, and more knowledgeable of the development goals of the government.\r\nWe should also move more swiftly against erring or corrupt government employees. We should make the investigation and hearing of administrative and anti-graft cases expeditious.\r\nIt might even be necessary to create special courts to hear these civil service cases of which we have a huge backlog. One reason for the lax discipline in the civil service is the length of time it takes to resolve an administrative or anti-graft case.\r\nReforms in the civil service are long overdue. We should have them soon, or our civil service will continue to be a drag on our development efforts.\r\nPopulation control continues to be an important program of the administra\u00adtion because of its deep implications for our development goals. I am glad to note that we have made some gains in population control. If the present trend continues, we shall be able, within this decade, to hold in check and to stabilize our population.\r\nThe Philippine Medical Care Commission, which I set up August last year, now, services 3.5 million SSS and 650,000 GSIS members. By April this year, dispensation of benefits will start. We have also begun laying the groundwork for the extension of the Medicare program to all our people.\r\nOnce again the last election put the life of our democracy to a test.\r\nThe people made their will felt through the polls. And we all abided.\r\nBut it was not by accident that the last elections were free, clean, and orderly. We took pains to make them so.\r\nWith the cooperation of Congress, we worked out electoral reforms which made election frauds difficult. At the same time, we fully mobilized the govern\u00adment, especially the Armed Forces, to enforce the electoral law. This involved the commitment of 36,000 personnel, 700 vehicles, 12 aircraft, and 14 vessels, all of the Armed Forces, for the purpose of insuring peaceful and orderly elections.\r\nNo matter which political party or candidates won, the last elections were a vindication of our unfailing faith in democracy.\r\nCongress this year is faced with the challenge and the opportunity of legislating urgent solutions to a wide spectrum of social and economic problems.\r\nMay I call upon you, therefore, to give topmost priority to legislation that will accelerate our social and economic development.\r\nI ask you to vote the necessary funds according to the following priorities already agreed upon by the leaders of the Executive Branch and of Congress in pre-session conferences.\r\nFirst, for peace and order, principally reforms in the police system, a vigorous campaign against traffic in drugs, and the creation of additional circuit criminal courts.\r\nWe must radically reorganize the local police organizations. Either the national government which is held responsible for their failures should be given commensurate powers or the local governments and officials be held liable and punishable for nonperformance.\r\nAt present, governors who are held responsible for peace and order have no police organizations at their disposal.\r\nThe Police Act must be updated and streamlined.\r\nSecond, support for the fight against inflation, including incentives for domestic rice production.\r\nThird, a development fund which shall be a special account in the general fund to be used exclusively for special development projects.\r\nFourth, the reorganization bill which will streamline our government at national, regional, and provincial levels to cope with the rising demands of our people.\r\nFifth, reforms in education to make our school system more responsive to the requirements of national development.\r\nSixth, rural employment promotion, including manpower training and development, the stimulation of cottage industries, and short-term agricultural activities.\r\nSeventh, rural electrification.\r\nEighth, agrarian reform.\r\nNinth, housing for the workers and their families.\r\nTenth, cooperatives in the rural areas.\r\nEleventh, postal reforms to modernize and reorganize the postal system of the country. Up to now no funds have been set aside to liquidate the debts of the Post Office amounting to about P24 million.\r\nAnd twelfth, a systematic retirement law for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\r\nIn addition to these projects which require funding, I should like to impress on Congress the importance of a number of bills.\r\nI am reiterating the passage of a law creating a small-enterprise board to encourage the healthy growth of medium- and small-scale industries.\r\nI am recommending the passage of legislation to enlarge the capitalization and strengthen the charier of the Philippine National Bank.\r\nI am asking for the passage of the new Oil Exploration Bill to encourage the entry of high-risk foreign capital and to accelerate the discovery of mineral fuels in our country.\r\nWe must study an amendment to the mining laws which will prevent over\u00adlapping claims and which shall end all conflicts which have hindered the development of rich mining claims by authorizing the prior locator to administer and operate the mining claim, subject to the filing of a bond or the deposit of certain portions of the income with the Bureau of Mines or the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources.\r\nI reiterate the proposal to increase the tax on idle lands, and to confiscate or cancel titles to former public lands acquired by private individuals but which have not been cultivated productively for a long time.\r\nWe must now set aside large zones of forest lands which cannot be entered by farmers, settlers, loggers, cattlemen, and industrialists. At the same time, we must determine which parts of our country shall now be opened to agricultural activity; otherwise all forests will continue to be despoiled.\r\nWe must now provide all the means for the establishment of at least one copper smelter inasmuch as the additional production of our copper mines have been refused by our traditional smelters or are being penalized with various changes, thus raising the cost of Philippine copper.\r\nWe must now provide incentives for the moribund abaca industry and develop the pulp industry derived from abaca fiber.\r\nCongress must now study the strengthening of the Mindanao Development Authority. I urge Congress to provide sources of funds for this purpose specifically and for the development of the Mindanao, Sulu, Palawan area which is below the typhoon belt and therefore less prone to weather calamities.\r\nI ask Congress to provide legislation which will prevent the further migra\u00adtion of Christian settlers in certain areas of Mindanao which shall be set aside for Muslims and other cultural minorities.\r\nTo minimize the destructive effects of recurrent floods, a long-range in\u00adtegrated and national flood control program has been prepared and submitted to Congress.\r\nI reiterate the need for the immediate passage of the bills on flood control now pending in Congress.\r\nI also ask Congress to enact the port works bill to improve and develop our major ports.\r\nI propose the establishment of a special irrigation fund for the construction operation and maintenance of irrigation systems to tap our land resources for increased productivity. I also propose an increase in the capitalization of the National Irrigation Administration.\r\nI urge Congress to consider a proposal to create a National Telecommuni\u00adcations Commission to formulate and administer the administration\u2019s policies on telecommunication services.\r\nIt is time that the Highway Special Act of 1953 was amended to suit present needs and to provide a rational allocation and sharing of the highway special fund based on technical requirements.\r\nIn our drive against criminality, we will need penal laws, both substantive and remedial, which are attuned to the spirit of the time.\r\nI urge Congress to approve the proposed Code of Crimes, now pending before this august body. It radically changes the concept of crime and punishment or penology.\r\nI propose that Congress create in the Department of Justice or Labor an institution that will give free legal aid to indigents.\r\nI ask that Congress and the Executive work out amendments to the Civil Service Law that will remove the impediments to the prosecution and dismissal of grafters and incompetents in the government service, many of whom find a ready refuge in the present Civil Service.\r\nOur policy is to respond promptly and vigorously whenever a charge of graft and corruption is brought against any official or employee of the government. The record has been itemized and often reiterated. More cases of graft have been filed during the past six years against erring officials and employees than during previous administrations.\r\nThere are, however, structural defects in the disciplinary machinery of the government which will require a serious review of the Civil Service Law, originally meant to defend merit, but which serves just as well as a refuge of grafters in the government. Recently, five employees in the Bureau of Treasury were found guilty of embezzlement. They were dismissed. But they have been reinstated because of the laxity of the Civil Service. I propose that we work out reforms that would restore to the administrators of government the authority to decide administrative cases, compatible with the responsibility that they are called upon to exercise.\r\nWe must correct the laws that shield the crooks and the grafters. Incident\u00adally, the Office of the President has no direct control over the Civil Service Commission. Perhaps the Constitutional Convention may take cognizance of this problem in their work, but it is our immediate task to change those procedures and practices that make a mockery of public office by giving crooks and incompetents in government an official refuge.\r\nI propose that a period of amnesty for illegal holders of firearms be estab\u00adlished during which they may report and register their firearms, and that after the expiration of the period of amnesty there shall commence a compulsory process to compel seizure, taking into account civil rights.\r\nCongress should also update the law on drug addiction. Both the Depart\u00adment of Justice and the Department of Health should be given funds and powers for this special crusade.\r\nI should like to make a special plea for the reorganization plan. Under Republic Act No. 6175, the period for the submission by the President of an integrated plan to reorganize the executive branch was extended to not later than 40 calendar days after the opening of the third regular session. This was intended to give time for members of Congress to react to the plan which, under the law, they must either accept or reject\r\nThe Reorganization Commis\u00adsion has made revisions and refinements in the plan after taking into account reactions received from members of both Houses of Congress and from heads of the various executive departments.\r\nIn the past year the technical staff of the Reorganization Commission also participated in the performance audit of 11 executive departments and nine other major agencies of the government. In the improvement of the plan, due account was taken of the findings and recommendations embodied in the per\u00adformance audit reports, as well as relevant provisions of the recent acts of Congress. Moreover, the technical staff made further in-depth studies to identify and rectify possible deficiencies in the initial draft of the plan. The pattern of administrative regionalization throughout the country was reexamined and refined.\r\nI am certain that the reorganization plan will provide the government with a more rational, economical, and effective machinery for public administration, and thus enable us to plan and implement more effectively our programs of socioeconomic development, security and welfare, to say nothing of the requirements of general government.\r\nThe implementation of the reorganization plan, if approved, will lead to immediate improvements in administrative structure and operations which need not await the new Constitution. For the administrative and organizational improvements proposed in the plan will remain relevant and applicable, whatever system of government or other fundamental changes the Constitu\u00adtional Convention may eventually adopt.\r\nAnd finally, I ask for the cooperation of Congress in enacting the laws that will make these programs come alive. You and I have been partners for six years in the exciting but turbulent work of nation-building. We have, you and I, charted a sure and steady course towards a fuller life for our people. Let us keep that course, that direction, and when finally the din of partnership has died down and the silence of history has enveloped our deeds, we hope to have the satisfaction of looking back on this period and whispering to ourselves that with courage and resolution we did not fail our country.\r\nThe Constitutional Convention has set itself, with admirable optimism, the middle of this year as the target date to complete its work. It is my hope that the self-imposed deadline will be met. For the Constitutional Convention has raised great hopes and expectations that its members are now obliged to match with their deeds.\r\nThe Convention will determine not only the form of government but also the nature of the society that will emerge in the country. The great social questions\u2014the institution of property, the social and economic relationships based on land, the structure of ownership and control of private and public resources: These are the profound questions that fall to no legislature in ordinary course to decide, but only to a constituent assembly with a mandate to help shape a country\u2019s every foundations.\r\nNo Filipino anxious for the welfare of his country, therefore, will begrudge the Constitutional Convention the full measure of best wishes in its historic task.\r\nIn 1972 it is expected that there will be more funds for economic activity, for industrialists, for entrepreneurs, and for both agriculture and industry.\r\nFor instance, for infrastructure alone in the Four-Year Development Plan, we will spend about P8 billion in four years out of the total of P34 billion required by the plan. We intend to encourage the banks to improve their facilities to finance the requirements of industry by noninflationary means. At the same time, the source of funding will not appreciably increase the money supply and thus further increase in the pressures of inflation on the economy. Thus, while for the coming year we intend to spend P1.4 billion for infrastructure, most of the expenditures will come from tax collections, savings, and loans.\r\nWith the expected amendment of the charter of the Philippine National Bank, as agreed upon with the leaders of Congress, the PNB will be in a better position to finance economic activities. The DBP by the beginning of the fiscal year will be in a position to lend out fresh capital in larger amounts for large- and medium-scale ventures. The Government Service Insurance System and the Social Security System are engaged in financing various enterprises, most important of which is housing, for which P400 million will be spent. We have also allocated P600 million out of available funds for the National Electrifica\u00adtion Administration.\r\nThese are some of the hopeful trends that reinforce the prospects for a brighter economic year ahead of us in 1972.\r\nThere is a law of development that states: An organism grows according to the demands made upon it. Great demands can build great strength\u2014in responsive men, or peoples.\r\nFaced with awesome demands upon our nation\u2019s vigor and endurance in the past two years, a lesser people might have faltered or even gone under. We did not flinch, we confronted these events. This bold confrontation and mastery of crisis has bred great strength in the Filipino people. I believe that we have emerged from the turmoil and the tensions of our society stronger in conviction and faith in the necessity of human liberty.\r\nThus, we see initial uncertainty and difference giving way to a strong and solid confidence in the ability of freedom to contend and prevail in any arena. Democracy is not a synonym for political naivet\u00e9. Democracy, in the exercise of its own strategic defensive, may program its own permissiveness, in accordance with constitutional processes, to meet the threats to its own existence, in short to defend its own institutions against wanton attacks.\r\nBut the main challenge to democracy, in my belief, is not the threat of an alienated minority. We can control this threat. The real test lies in its capacity to perform according to its own standards, according to the hopes that it raises, the dreams that it excites. For democracy must match its own promise in our midst, otherwise it will be judged to have failed, not because it is inadequate but because it has never been tried.\r\nWe must make democracy work for our people\u2014in terms of equality and fraternity, but also a wider sharing of opportunities, a more energetic commit\u00adment to justice, with genuine and unmistakable priorities for the welfare and well-being of the very poor.\r\nWe must see to it that economic growth is translated into social progress. Thus may we achieve the ultimate purpose of all economic undertakings, name\u00adly, the dignity of the human person. This is what I have called a Democratic Revolution.\r\nI ask that Congress write the laws that I have proposed, to give meaning and substance to such a revolution.\r\nExperience warns us that the people\u2019s welfare will here contend against a foe so invisible and yet so real, always corrosive, often all-pervading. I refer to the great tempter that will try to deflect you from your urgent legislative tasks, the spirit of faction, the specter of partisanship. We must scorn and subjugate this tempter which lurks within us.\r\nWe must stand together as one nation because ranged against us are forces sworn to disrupt our cohesion and convert brothers into enemies. No one can put off this menace, nor can we beg for time before our threatened enslavement.\r\nIn a world chronically torn by crisis and convulsed with conflict, we shall continue to put our trust in human liberty and dignity: We shall continue to seek our fullest growth in freedom; nor shall we stop to ask the price or count the cost in defending our birthright.\r\nFortified by the trials we have undergone, the ordeals we have passed, our people can no longer be daunted by crisis in the days ahead. For they will be strong in the knowledge that each hardship surmounted and every crisis mastered can only strengthen the fiber and temper the soul of the nation.\r\nTogether we must, in unity, command our present and our future as a nation by converting dangers into opportunities, crisis into strength and today\u2019s reverses into tomorrow\u2019s momentum for advance. The alternative is for us all\u2014the leadership of today regardless of partisan differences\u2014to be judged as having defaulted our last clear chance to keep our country united\u2014and free.", "title": "Strength through Crisis, Growth in Freedom"},

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at Rizal Park, Manila, on September 21, 1977]\r\n\r\nOn this important day of national observance, one cannot think of a happier way to celebrate the fifth year of our New Society than to be among you today\u2014joined with all the youth of the land in the proclamation of the new Constitution of the Kabataang Barangay, and linked to such a vibrant expression of support to our national endeavors.\r\nPractice has made of this anniversary an annual occasion for the Presidency to report upon the state of the nation. It is entirely fitting that I should now make this report to our people from this forum, for so much of what I have to say has to do with our youth and their concerns\u2014the fate of our rising generations and the hopes and aspirations of the future.\r\nWe complete today the first five years of crisis government, yet it is not towards the past to which our thoughts are beamed. We think of the many changes and developments that have taken place in our country during this half-decade, but they only call to mind the labors and the tasks ahead.\r\nI have just returned from a 10-day journey through Central and Northern Luzon, and in the course of that journey I talked with many of our countrymen\u2014farmers, laborers, teachers, students, and government officials. And these encounters could not have reinforced me more in the conviction that the last five years have really meant something to our people and to our young nation, that they have really counted for much in changing their lives and their hopes for the future. And more important, I have yet to experience a more concrete expres\u00adsion of the kind of optimism and confidence that is resurgent in our country today.\r\nWe are a nation that is changing before our very eyes; five years have not settled us in the cake of habit and custom. Regardless of what we have accomplished, we continue to be young, enterprising, and vigorous.\r\nThis to me is what matters most as I look at our country today.\r\nYet it was not so long ago when this country tottered helplessly in chaos and paralysis.\r\nFive years ago, when we began our program of national transformation, it was our lot to launch under the shroud of many auguries of failure the tasks we had set before ourselves. At home, we were detained by grave challenges to the very authority of government and the survival of the Republic. There were voices everywhere predicting the dissolution of martial rule into further chaos and conflict in the land. Abroad, we were looked upon as another nation lost to the forces of social disintegration and revolution. But the nation has survived and endured.\r\nAnd we are a society today whose hopes are raised not just towards meeting the crisis of the hour, but to the challenges of the rest of the decade and beyond. Regardless of the many uncertainties that international life hold out today to many nations, we approach with confidence the many problems that confront us, and we know our national prospects to be better than they have ever been in the past.\r\nThis decisive change in national outlook and national prospects did not take place overnight. It is the result of years of patient and resolute effort. And if we stand today upon anew threshold of possibilities, it is because we have not denied the nation the kind of nurture and vigilance that it required.\r\nFive years ago today, when we took that decisive turn of the path, there was no doubt in my minds as there soon came to be in yours that it was a path we had to take, even if it was a path we had not travelled before and for which we had no certain guide. Today, five years later, there is no doubt in my mind as there can be no doubt in yours that the path we took has led us out of the dark forest of our past, a forest where every object and vegetation had conspired to deny us a way to survival and progress as a nation. We have escaped from that dark forest; but let us not forget its shape lest we stumble into it once more. How effective in fact has crisis government been in the last five years? How different is our condition today from our condition five years ago?\r\nThe answers to these questions may be suggested by the following facts:\r\n1. National security has been maintained against insurgency, the national territorial integrity has been preserved against secessionism, and peace and order have been decisively recovered from the private armies, the criminal syn\u00addicates, and the ordinary criminals.\r\n2. The gross national product has more than doubled from $8,325,000 in 1972 to nearly $18 billion today. In 1972, the rate of GNP growth was 4.9%. In the last five years, the GNP has grown yearly by an average rate of 3%. This average rate of growth under the management of the crisis government was raised up to 9.6% when the world economy was booming and kept from falling below 5.9% when the world economy was in severe recession.\r\n3. The per capita gross national product has increased from $213 in 1972 to more than $400 today, an increase of nearly 200%.\r\n4. Our government tax revenue has increased by more than 250% from P6.4 billion pesos in 1972 to nearly P17 billion today and our total budget has correspondingly increased from P5,589,000, to more than P26,200,000 in the same period\u2014an increase by 4.7 times.\r\nOur balance of payments deficits have been reversed to surpluses and our foreign exchange reserves increased by about $1 billion in the first two years of martial law.\r\n5. In 1972 the government spent only over P3 billion of its budget for social and economic development. Today, it is spending P15 billion of its budget for that purpose\u2014an increase of nearly five times.\r\n6. In 1972 the government expenditures were on a 3-to-1 basis in favor of the urban areas. Now it is 4-to-1 in favor of the rural areas.\r\n7. Our agrarian reform program has taken an irreversible momentum, covering the entire country of almost 1 million tenants in 1.7 million hectares of farmland. At the end of 1976, the government issued land transfer certificates to 62% of the total number of eligible tenants.\r\n8. Today the government spends for health and social services five times that spent in 1972 less than P1 billion. Today it is spending P5 billion.\r\n9. \u00a0Inflation has been brought down from the high of more than 40% to 7 or 8%.\r\n10. During the last five years, we have significantly cut down unemploy\u00adment. From about 8% of the labor force before martial law, total unemployment is now down t0 4.5%. In 1975, it was down to 3.6%. In Metro Manila, according to a survey of the Bureau of Employment Services, 2.2 members of the family are employed. Again, in Metro Manila, a worker with any employable skills can land a job in less than three months from the time he begins looking for work. In the provinces, of course, almost all members of the family are involved in the day-to-day effort of making a living.\r\nBut the New Society has not only opened up new jobs for the workers; It has also shielded them from the damning effects of inflation. Thus, during the last five years, the minimum wage has more than doubled from the daily wage before martial law of P4.00 to P5.00.\r\nFor the minimum wage today actually consists of the following: (1) for nonagricultural workers, P10 in Metro Manila, P9 in the provinces, and P11 in the sugar industry; for agricultural workers, P7 a day, except in the sugar industry where it is a P8 in some localities; (2) the 13th month pay under PD 851, which is actually an increase of 8.33% in basic pay; (3) the P50, P30, or P15 emergency allowance under PD 525, depending upon the capitalization or total assets of an employer; (4) the P60 emergency allowance under PD 1123; (5) the 10 paid holidays; 6) the 30% premium pay for work on special hol\u00adidays and rest days; (7) the 100% premium pay for work from 10 o\u2019clock at night to 6 o\u2019clock the following morning; and (9) the five-day service incentive leave with pay.\r\nAll these mandatory benefits add up to an average take home pay of P16.30 for nonagricultural workers in Metro Manila, P15.00 for nonagricultural workers in the provinces, P17.00 for nonagricultural workers in the sugar industry, P13.30 for agricultural workers in general and P14.30 for some agricultural workers in the sugar industry.\r\nSince 2.2 members of the family are employed in Metro Manila, then the family take-home pay in Metro Manila is actually more than P30 a day. In the provinces, the family take-home pay is definitely higher than the combined minimum wage and benefits because of their traditional nonwage sources of income.\r\nThere is a corresponding increase in savings and time deposits from P7 billion to about P24 billion.\r\nIf extremist agitators or the Left and the Right have found it difficult to stampede workers into illegal rallies, demonstration, and strikes, it is because the combined effects of rising employment and wages have reinforced the faith of the workers in themselves, in their future and the New Society.\r\nBut the New Society has protected not only the wages of the workers but also their total sense of economic security. As employees, they now enjoy security of employment tenure. They cannot be dismissed without just cause and without the permission of the Secretary of Labor, unlike before martial law when the employer could virtually dismiss them at will by merely paying their separation pay. They are now more adequately secured against sickness, injury, death, and maternity under the SSS, Medicare, and ECC. Not only have the benefits increased during the last five years but the delivery of the benefits has been speeded up.\r\nIn the field of unionism, the New Society has given the Filipino workers the first optimum opportunity for self-development. The dismantling of Congress, the private armies, and the whole apparatus of oligarchy at the inception of martial law opened up new, vast areas for unionization. Hundreds of sugar plantations, logging camps, fishing ventures, and industrial enclaves were for the first time made accessible to unionism. Hence, martial law has, in fact, expanded the right of the Filipino workers to self-organization and free collective bargaining.\r\n11. In five years, we built more roads, schoolhouses, bridges, public build\u00adings, electric power plants, and irrigation than what we had built in the past 100 years before 1972.\r\n12. In 1972 institutional credit was not widely available to tenants, small farmers, and rural entrepreneurs. Since then literally billions of pesos have been channeled to them through the DBF, the PNB, and the 800 rural banks now in operation.\r\n13. We have attained self-sufficiency in rice after seemingly endless years of dependence on imports; we have struck oil and gas, whose real commercial value even now is being analyzed, and despite the falling prices of our exports in the world market, added on to the soaring prices of oil, which we continue to import, we have been able to manage our trade imbalances, successfully reducing them progressively to tolerable limits.\r\n14. We have successfully curbed inflation, which is the many-headed hydra of our modem economic world, from an alarming figure of 40% in 1972, to 7.2% at present. Our international reserves have risen to a phenomenal US$1.5 billion from the moribund position in 1972.\r\n15. There is a boom in investments, from domestic as well as foreign sources, reflecting confidence in our economy\u2014in the way it is being managed and in the long-term possibilities it holds for the investor.\r\n16. Tourism has multiplied by nearly 600%\u2014from a measly 168,000 in 1972 to nearly 700,000 in 1977\u2014and despite the economic crisis that hit the world at the same time that we were building the tourism infrastruc\u00adture of our country, we continue to attract a fair share of the world\u2019s travelers. Manila has become the center of international assemblies and meetings.\r\n17. The streamlining of government to suit the temper and the demand of the times has made it possible for us to render service outside the old calculus of official possibilities and public expectations, and today the highest official of the land is mandated to go down to the rural areas and serve the people. In institutionalizing this practice, we hope to find a lasting bond between govern\u00adment and the people.\r\n18. Not only incomes\u2014both urban and rural\u2014have increased; the desire and the capacity of individual wage earners to save has been enhanced, and in the five-year period from 1972 to 1977, savings and time deposits countrywide have risen P7 billion to P23 billion\u2014or from 7 million account holders to 15 million account holders, which constituted over one-third of the national population.\r\nIn the last five years, we have succeeded in consolidating political authority in the face of rebellion, secession, and anarchy. We have succeeded in effective\u00adly employing this authority to begin to establish the infrastructure of a New Society in the acceleration of economic growth, in the democratization of land, public resources, and economic opportunities, in the reform of institutions and in the reestablishment of a stable public order where the rights of all, especially of the majority, can be protected. Finally, we have succeeded on a broad front, economic, political, and social, in imparting a momentum for change that will soon be difficult to reverse.\r\nI have often thought in the past five years of the man who is the object of all our efforts in establishing the New Society. Because he is the average Filipino, he lives in the barrio and works at a farm. When all the programs we have launched and all the changes we have sought will reach him, and I am determined that this will be sooner rather than later, he will be able to lead a life of dignity without any unfulfilled basic wants. He now owns the farm which he used to cultivate as a mere tenant. He will be able to raise two to three crops in a year through irrigation because water will be made available all year round. The barangay in which he lives will not be without the services of electricity for his modest house, of a schoolhouse for the education of his children, and of a health center for the sick members of his family. His children will be able to choose to farm or to make their living employed in some small-scale industry. In the intimate solidarity of the barangay, he and his family and his neighbors as well as his friends can plan to build the road they would need to reach the next barangay or to call on the town officials to extend municipal help.\r\nHe can hope. More than that there is no limit to his achievements. The future ahead is bright.\r\nIs this a dream for some distant day in the future? No, it is the New Society we are building today.\r\nIn five years, we have taken decisive steps towards the transformation and development of our national life and the building of our New Society. We have seen our vision whole, and we have moved considerably towards its fulfillment.\r\nBut our journey is not finished. And we stand at this midpoint of our first decade face to face with new challenges and new burdens.\r\nThe agenda for our nation is marked by three basic plans. There is first, the political normalization process and the strengthening of the barangays and the participation in the plans of the youth of the land specially through the Kabataang Barangay; second, the greater emphasis on rural development; and third, the long range socioeconomic development plans.\r\nDevelopment, as we have seen during all these past years, generates its own dynamic, multiplying the tasks and cares of the nation, even as it alters the circumstances of our lives and our society.\r\nTo this effort\u2014of defining new goals for national achievement, of crystallizing the work that must yet be done, and of clarifying the struggles that must yet be waged\u2014we must now move, resolute and undivided.\r\nThis is of the utmost importance first in the sphere of our enlarging relation\u00adships in the family of nations.\r\nIt must therefore be our paramount concern now to increase, to expand, and to promote our productive participation in ASEAN, in keeping with the long-term program which the member countries have enunciated for the regional community.\r\nAs we clarify our role and our place in regional affairs, so also must we readjust our outlook vis-\u00e1-vis the other nations of the world and the problems of international affairs in our time.\r\nThough we have taken the momentous step of opening ties with the Com\u00admunist countries and of identifying our cause with the nations of the Third World, we see many problems in international relations that require more than ever the steadfast pursuit of an independent foreign policy.\r\nThe old fears of Communist aggression have considerably died down, but we have yet to forge a strong and beneficial relationship with the Communist countries, particularly with the new regimes in Indochina. And there are dangers that the old fears may be resuscitated by certain elements in our coun\u00adtry, or by untoward developments in mainland Southeast Asia.\r\nWe have reason to believe that what we have achieved during the past few years in our relations with the Communist countries, particularly the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, constitutes a significant start towards building peace and progress in our part of the world. And it should be of paramount importance that in the coming years, our relations with these nations should vigorously be promoted.\r\nThis initiative should not weaken by any means our ties with the Western nations, with the United States and Europe. Though it is manifest that there has been a definitive end to the ties of dependence that once joined us to the United States, the new relationship has gained much strength and meaning from the reorientation of these ties.\r\nThe world is passing through a period of transition in which many of the old issues that once decreed the patterns of our relationship have become irrele\u00advant. Food and development, not politics, are the central issues of our time. And the dangers to the peace obtain foremost from the problems of poverty and underdevelopment so rampant in the world.\r\nFor this reason, the campaign for reform of the international economic order must be placed high in our national agenda. And we must strive to strengthen and nourish the bonds that we have created between ourselves and the rest of the Third World.\r\nLargely because of remaining problems in the area of peace and order and national security, it is not possible for us to implement at this time the full lifting of martial law. The overall situation is not sufficiently stabilized to warrant it; this however, should not prevent us from undertaking various policies related to full normalization.\r\nThe normalization process is an ineluctable development of the progress towards growth and stability we have made during the past five years, and it re\u00admains mainly a question of how wisely and prudently we can manage this transition to full normality.\r\nFor this is preeminently the time to turn our experience during the last five years of crisis leadership into new viable structures of our political life. This is the time to test whether the efforts devoted to rebuilding political relations between government and governed, to molding new forms for citizen participa\u00adtion, can now find life in more permanent structures and policies.\r\nThis is why we have set the holding of elections by 1978.\u00a0 I am resolved that we implement this plan.\r\nAnd this is also why following my announcement of the holding of elec\u00adtions, there has been fresh discussion of the form of government that our evolv\u00ading political system must finally take.\r\nWhen I announced the holding of elections by next year, I originally envisioned the progressive implementation of the mandate written in our Constitution. Since that announcement was made. however, numerous sugges\u00adtions have been made\u2014that a national referendum should first be held on the matter of the form of government, that the elections should be national rather than local\u2014and these all require study and resolution by our electorate.\r\nOn the matter of the form of government, however, it is my intent that gov\u00adernment itself should not take part in the settlement of this issue. The people must decide. If there is need for the Constitution to be amended, the people must decide whether it should be done through the Batasang Bayan or through a Constitutional Convention.\r\nAnd the government shall fully abide by the people\u2019s verdict.\r\nIn any event, it is vital that we commence immediately the series of public discussions on these matters and that enabling policies be formulated for their full resolution.\r\nHere, as before, it is our firm vow that so long as martial law continues it will be used to attain reforms. And it will always be exercised with restraint, tolerance, and compassion.\r\nAnd where a decision has been fully rendered for the holding of national or local elections, we shall take the step of lifting martial law during the conduct of the campaign and the polls.\r\nIn all this, we must not lose sight of the fact that our objective here is not to satisfy merely the desire for normalization or to mollify critics of martial law. We are committed to this process of normalization because we believe the time for it is now, and that the operations of a permanent political order will serve our vital goals of economic modernization, social change, and national transforma\u00adtion.\r\nWe have demonstrated during the last five years the ability of our crisis government to govern. But we must always remember that crisis leadership, however effective, is a temporary exercise of constitutional power, fit for an unsettled time.\r\nNow, we must demonstrate the full capacity of our society to marshal its resources and its experiences towards the building of a more stable political order.\r\nThere will of course always be the danger that in this critical transition, we may lose many of the vital gains we have made and the society will dissolve once more into the factionalism and chaos of the past. But this is not a case for us of rushing heedlessly into normalization; we have worked long and hard at creating the infrastructure of our national democracy. And we need not fear either that in the process of transition there will be an interregnum in which public authority will again retreat meekly to the sidelines. Crisis leadership, as in the past, will be the anchor of our hopes.\r\nTogether with this plan is a 10-Year Development Plan for 1978-1987, and a Long-Term Development Plan up to the year 2000.\r\nThese plans have been evolved with the participation of the whole government machinery at all levels\u2014national, regional, and local. Moreover, the active involvement of the private sector has been an indispensable element in these planning efforts. Every effort was taken to involve our people in the planning process.\r\nThe importance of these plans is self-evident. This is the first time that we have undertaken the effort of planning national development on a broad time frame. All our previous plans covered only a period of four to five years. And these plans do not represent merely a plan for economic growth and develop\u00adment; they are rather a blueprint for the whole society.\r\nThe kind of development we want and need is not merely economic advance. In the past, development has all too often been considered merely as economic growth, measured in terms of sustained increases in per capita income and gross national product. We know, however, that economic growth does little to stabilize the national community where it does not result also in the improvement of the well-being of the broad masses of our people. We know that we must gel down to the business of reaching the poorest segment of our populations\u2014the urban and the rural poor, the unemployed, the underemployed, the homeless dweller, the out-of-school youth, the landless worker, the sacada, the sustenance fisherman.\r\nThis is to my mind the most important part of the national agenda: the achievement of national development and its full democratization.\r\nFirst, in order to ensure the balanced growth of the whole economy and the whole country, the new national plan sets forth the vigorous development of the rural sector.\r\nIn line with this, we have adopted the integrated area development approach which ensures the linkage of various factors critical to the uplift of depressed areas\u2014infrastructure, rural electrification, irrigation, credit facilities, market\u00ading networks, basic social services, and community development projects.\r\nTo stimulate agricultural production, we shall step up further our ongoing Masagana 99 and Masaganang Maisan programs, and intensify various programs relating to cattle development, dairy development, animal dispersal, expanded fish production, cotton development, land reform, and cooperative development.\r\nTo ensure the dispersal of industry towards the countryside, vital industrial projects will be developed on a regional scale, taking advantage of indigenous resources within the various regions. A copper smelter project will be set up in Batangas; an integrated iron and steel mill in Misamis Oriental; ammonia-urea, nuclear power, and petrochemical plants in Bataan; long kraft fiber plant in Abra; ship repair in Zambales; an export processing zone in Mactan, Cebu; and various other projects for the other regions.\r\nAnd with equal emphasis, greater stress will be given to the promotion of agribusiness enterprises throughout the country.\r\nSecondly, we must place high priority on trade diversification and rational\u00adization in order to stabilize the position of our foreign trade. It is our traditional exports that will require the utmost effort to obtain better terms in the interna\u00adtional economy, but full trade expansion requires intensive effort to develop manufactures and semimanufactures for the world market.\r\nThe high importance of this objective will become more telling as the development process accelerates, demanding new and greater infusions of investments, which fundamentally must be provided by our export sector.\r\nThird, in order to keep up with the demand for greater productivity, scienti\u00adfic and technological skills must be vigorously developed to meet the require\u00adments of growth.\r\nGreater technology transfer from the advanced countries obviously must seep into the national economic effort, but there must also be development from within of appropriate science and technology. We must invest substantially in research and technological development, and we must strive to utilize indigenous materials in agriculture and industry.\r\nFourth, we must progressively transform our energy source structure in order to utilize more effectively energy supplies for development purposes, and to achieve a safer mix of primary supplies. Our development program cannot afford the risk of supply disruptions, nor can it allow the wasteful utilization of expensive oil supplies.\r\nFifth, we must adopt a more effective program for the management of the environment. Development activities must be properly located to meet environ\u00admental standards for air, water, and land. Human settlements must be properly sited with due consideration for maintaining the ecological balance, for development can easily make hazardous the lives of individuals in our society, and generate social and economic problems on a grand scale.\r\nFinally, our new plan seeks to harness the tremendous human resources potential of the country. To develop these resources, however, calls for vigorous effort to improve the physical, intellectual, and material well-being of the indi\u00advidual.\r\nIt is here where the economic development and social development must move in concert. For economic growth to fully take off, we must mobilize to the full the resources of our population; on the other hand, for our population to deliver vital inputs into the economic endeavor, it must be nourished and developed.\r\nThe development of human resources requires three stages of nurture, each of which is vital and paramount.\r\nFirstly, we shall need to devote more and more attention to the problems of health, nutrition, and housing in our country. The delivery of basic social services, particularly in the rural sector, must be considered as a sine qua non to the total rural development program. We have to improve our area coverage, from the biggest of our cities to the remotest of our rural communities.\r\nSecondly, we must invest a greater portion of our resources in the education and cultural development of our people. Recent reforms undertaken in the educational system to reorient and improve the quality of education must now be followed by intensive efforts to develop workable programs particularly for out-of-school youth, and for adult education. Manpower development must strive to cover a wider circle of beneficiaries and must include a greater number of skills and crafts.\r\nFinally, it is all important that we expand the access of individuals to job opportunities, and that we fully give them the protection of our laws concerning wages, work security, and social security.\r\nTogether, these various activities constitute our national strategy for development for the next five years. And the framework is embodied in various key policies. I shall refer here only to the most vital of these.\r\nFirstly, on the matter of the roles of the private and the public sectors. In line with the national development plan, the public sector will continue to engage in activities which are capital-intensive, high risk, and vital to the national interest. This is of critical importance because various areas of enterprise will conceivably not move without the vigorous activity of government.\r\nBut while we recognize this to be an imperative in certain areas, the private sector will continue to be the prime mover of development activities. It must and will remain the backbone of our economic life.\r\nSecondly, it must be a matter of national policy that we maintain population growth at levels conducive to national welfare. This policy will be pursued without prejudice to the health status and religious beliefs of individuals. But we must clearly strive now to bring our population growth rate down to 2.1% by 1982, and to 1.8% by 1987.\r\nThirdly, it is a matter of national policy that economic activities be designed to promote the greater utilization of our human resources. The development of manpower skills will be aligned with the requirements of growth. And labor exports which have been temporarily allowed to ease underemployment will increasingly be restrained as productive domestic employment opportunities are created.\r\nFourthly, domestic and foreign investments will continue to be encouraged especially in defined areas of priority. Current investment incentives as well as new incentives will be further rationalized or promulgated in order to stimulate and expand economic activity.\r\nFinally, we shall pursue as a matter of international economic policy the achievement of greater economic cooperation with other countries, and the re\u00adform of the international economic order.\r\nOn the whole, the 10-year plan period from 1978-1987 is designed to solidify the gains from the institutional and administrative changes introduced during the first five years of crisis government, and to create greater national self-reliance, more balanced regional development, and greater social equity. In the external sector, we envision our national export promotion drive to relieve the pressure on the country\u2019s balance of payments.\r\nThis vision of the future is no idle musing. It is embodied in specific targets for national achievement.\r\nIn the next five years, total gross national product is projected to grow by 7.7% per year. From a 7% growth rate expected in 1958, we envision it to rise to 7.5% in 1979 and 1980, and then accelerating by 8% per year in the next two years of the five-year plan period.\r\nFrom the 1976 level of P1,667 or $103, per capita income is projected to reach P2,155 by 1982. This represents a projected growth rate of 4.7% per year, and it is based on a projected population growth rate of 2.9% per year.\r\nTo finance the investment requirements of the plan will require the steady accumulation of resources for the building-up process. For the five-year period of 1978-1982, we envision a near doubling of investment.\r\nWe envision also a drop in net foreign capital inflow from the present 6.5% of GNP to about 3% by 1982, as a result of export diversifica\u00adtion and the increased capability of the economy to raise funds from domestic sources.\r\nBetween 1978 and 1979, we expect a major turning point in the economy to occur. Agriculture and industry will exhibit almost equal shares of total net domestic product. And after 1979, industry will account for an increasing share of total net domestic product while agriculture will register an oppositive trend.\r\nIndustry is projected to grow by 9.8% annually during the next five years, and by 10.5% in the rest of the 10-year plan period.\r\nAgricultural production, however, is projected to remain high, though it is projected to rise by approximately 5.3% annually during the 10-year period.\r\nThe foregoing review of the plan\u2014its objectives, strategies, policies, and targets\u2014provides us a picture of the decisive changes we project to occur in the national economy during the next five years, and up to 1987.\r\nThis is a blueprint for the future that fully takes into account the various problems and challenges that the society will face in the coming years. But it also presumes a great degree of harmonization among the various sectors of national life, and a totality of effort on the part of our people particularly those in the rural areas.\r\nCrucial to this whole design is the revitalization of our long-neglected rural sector, which only recently has risen to claim its rightful role in national endeavors, and which will continue to bear the greater focus of our plans and programs of action.\r\nWhen joined to our goals and programs in foreign affairs, national security, peace and order, and political life, they form a whole agenda for the nation on which we must now lavish our individual and collective efforts.\r\nThe agenda is vast as befits a nation that has grown to aspire for better things.\r\nFor this is where the ledger of the past five years has inexorably led us.", "title": "The Years of Crisis Government: Review and Preview"},
{"delivered": "1967-01-23 07:10:55+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 23, 1967]\r\nIn a moment like this, it is always fruitful to consider our relationship, and perhaps our relevance, to our own history.\r\nA historian has pointed out that history resembles a man on a steep ascent, who can hardly see what comes behind him on the preceding ledge. Fortunately, our own history as a nation is young enough for us to see behind us very clearly. When we see it thus as a whole, our history unfolds as a modern epic filled with the heroic deeds of our people.\r\nToday, this great epic is being written no longer with valorous exploits in arms, or with golden-tongued patriotic oratory. It is being written with a thousand acts of courage and faith from day to day\u2014in our barrios and in our cities: by farmers rising up to a new dignity as leaseholders, perhaps excited by the innovation of new seeds and fertilizers for multiplying their harvest; by tireless community development workers; by the children of sharecroppers crossing the great divide of ignorance and poverty, across the threshold of a barrio public school; by the new breed of merchants and entrepreneurs wrestling from the land new riches for themselves and their people.\r\nThe epic is also being written by men young and old who are laying a broad base for democracy in the rural areas through the self-government of barrio councils.\r\nWhat is being written is the epic of development. This is the story of how a fair-sized nation of 33 million is building a pioneer democratic society amidst conditions of underdevelopment. It may be said for all new nations without exception that they are engaged in the great labor of development. But our distinction lies in having chosen\u2014irrevocably\u2014the democratic alternative. We have rested our hopes not on the power of the state to compel growth through obedience, but to realize growth through self-actualizing citizenship which forms the ethic of democracy.\r\nThe state of the nation must be seen against this vista of past experience and contemporary objectives. The challenge of greatness is in continuing the national epic on a new stage and to a new climax\u2014the successful development of our country within the framework of democratic institutions. This is asserted to be impossible. But it is our duty and our historic privilege to attempt the impossible. This entails a thousand difficult tasks. But wisdom consists in attending to the problems at hand.\r\nLet me remind the nation that the odds which faced us a year ago, when I last stood here, were indeed formidable and fearsome. Let us glance in passing at the deep abyss from whence we have retrieved ourselves. The nation was in deep economic and moral crisis. The economic and social crisis consisted in a bankrupt government with a raided treasury, debt-ridden government corporations, inefficient agriculture, smuggling, lawlessness, rising prices, declining terms of trade.\r\nThe moral crisis consisted in a grave loss of confidence in ourselves and in the government and growing despair over the future of the economy and of the country.\r\nThe government cash position showed a negative balance of P228 million; loans for budget operations totaled more than P1 billion; expenditures were exceeding income by P2 million a day; outstanding loans from government corporations, of P408 million, threatened the continued existence of our largest commercial bank. Some P30 million of government money deposited in certain private banks could not be withdrawn. Government equipment, including those acquired through foreign loans, could not be accounted for.\r\nDomestic production in our cities was almost at a standstill, and our agriculture languished in the countryside. Smuggling of consumer goods was of massive proportions; the inflow of untaxed cigarettes alone was worth some P144 million in 1965. Smugglers were virtually running some government agencies. Confronted with this ruinous competition and tightening credit, domestic industries were turning desperate. It is only now that we have come to know fully the depths into which our country had been plunged.\r\nSince then, we have come far. We have made the ascent successfully, out of a period when the economy was at near collapse, and to a level from which the real takeoff could be made. Today, I propose to define how we have come out of the crises of the past year.\r\nTo begin with, we have corrected in 1966 many of the defects in government orientation and performance that we inherited, and set in place the foundation for continued growth. Last year, we,\r\nFirst, set government finances in order;\r\nSecond, improved business, investment, and employment conditions;\r\nThird, instituted administrative reforms in the government, relating them to the requirements of economic development;\r\nFourth, planned and executed the necessary infrastructure projects to support a comprehensive development program particularly in agriculture;\r\nFifth, maintained our domestic and international security;\r\nSixth, developed a new image for our country in international affairs, as a mediating influence in peacemaking activities;\r\nSeventh, reduced unemployment;\r\nEighth, prosecuted boldly the land reform program where before there was hesitation;\r\nNinth, battled resolutely the subversives where before there was government friendship and cooperation;\r\nTenth, stopped smuggling where before there was tolerance and even participation by certain government personnel; and\r\nEleventh, punished corruption where before there was reward.\r\nGoing over our first year in office, I believe it can be said honestly that we have shunned easy and facile solutions to deep-rooted problems; that we have not flinched before distasteful facts and alternatives; that in making our decisions we have looked to the future and deferred only to the interest of our country and people. We have not feared to innovate; most of our decisions have been acts of innovation.\r\nWhat are some of these important decisions, these innovations? Without any order of importance in mind, I would say that the first is the decision to release the forces of development at the risk of stimulating the prices of basic commodities. A faint-hearted administration would have sought temporary refuge behind ultraconservative policies aimed at forcing prices down as well as suppressing economic development. The relaxation of credit for the private sector was made to spur development, but we made it fully aware of the risk that this would increase prices. A mild increase of prices is a consequence of economic buoyancy and optimism.\r\nWe had to choose between palliatives such as artificial price rigging and a long-drawn out arduous, tedious but honest approach to the problem\u2014an approach that went to the heart of the problem. We chose the latter. We channeled our resources to the goal of higher production which is the only way to keep prices stable.\r\nWe had to choose between political expediency as manifested in capricious piecemeal public works on the one hand, and fiscal restraint and careful husbanding of our development funds on the other. We discouraged uncoordinated public works. Even releases of funds to congressional districts had to be integrated with the nation\u2019s infrastructure program. The whole year of 1968, no releases for what is commonly referred to as the \u201cpork barrel\u201d were made notwithstanding political importunings.\r\nHaving identified agriculture as a strategic area for national advancement, I sought without delay to mobilize the entire government machinery available as well as all forces and resources in the private sector for a vigorous agricultural policy. Today, some P250 million is committed to our rice and corn program, the ultimate objective of which is to insure self-sufficiency. Industry, however, has not been abandoned.\r\nWe inherited from the previous administration a dangerous situation in which more than 500 industries and firms were in distress, and unemployment was threatening to go out of hand. We did not lose any time in meeting these problems. In the face of criticism, we launched a rescue operation and we succeeded in bailing them out; we restored order out of chaos, and changed despair to faith and optimism. The refinancing and rehabilitation program required financial assistance and investments amounting to P250 million.\r\nWe have put an end to two decades of official hedging and temporizing on the application of land reforms laws. Even in the face of threats from some sectors and dire predictions of failure, we declared the 2nd District of Pampanga a land reform area. In the past, land reform was limited to a very few scattered municipalities.\r\nLast year, we saw the Armed Forces transformed into a large creative force for our social and economic development. The AFP today is a strong catalyst in our drive to build and change our society. A brigade consisting of 10 construction battalions has been formed. The soldier, too, has become a builder.\r\nOur administration has moved swiftly and courageously into conservation.\r\nIn our efforts to preserve our national wealth and to hand them down unimpaired to future generations, we incurred the resentment of powerful special interests. But we did not hesitate. In the past, government was indifferent to conservation. Today, the entire government stands ready to protect our patrimony.\r\nWe confronted the problem of smuggling, as it was never done before by the national government. We paid no attention to the cynics who said that smuggling could not be eradicated or even diminished. Today, the popular surveys point to the success in the antismuggling drive as the premier achievement last year.\r\nWe have gone out of our way to invite foreign investments. There is a renewed interest abroad in investment opportunities here. But we have not waited for such investments, or predicated our development projects on their arrival. I have called for self-reliance in our effort to develop our nation. No enduring success is possible without this. We have been quietly tapping the domestic sources of investments. We have sought, and in some instances with spectacular success, to attract local venture capital through the sale of bonds.\r\nWe have developed a private money market. We have engaged private capital in the essential task of building our infrastructure\u2014mainly roads and bridges. This, too, is unprecedented and was initially not without opposition.\r\nThe decision to send noncombatant troops to Vietnam was not easily made.\r\nThe issue had exacerbated the passions of articulate groups in our country. We sent the PHILCAG because we wanted to contribute to the mission of peace in Vietnam, and because we wanted to encourage the continued presence of our ally, the United States, in Asia to the extent that this served our national interest. The PHILCAG is doing its work well in South Vietnam. I shall present a separate bill to continue its support.\r\nAgainst the advice of the timid and the pessimists and to serve notice to the world of our interest in peace, we convoked a Seven-Nation Summit Conference in Manila. In a way, this reflects the desire of our nation to take an active part in international affairs, to exert our will on the problems of mankind rather than be merely swept along by international forces and events.\r\nSometimes, as in the case of the Retail Trade Nationalization Act, it has been necessary for the administration to take a forthright stand, compatible with the rule of law. The previous administration took the position that the courts had no jurisdiction over this issue, that this was a political question; it tended to look upon American-controlled corporations, besides American citizens, as beyond the pale of the law. We have taken the position that this issue is not political but legal, that the interpretation of the law is best left to an exalted and learned body and not susceptible to rabid partisanship such as the Supreme Court. Let us wait for the Supreme Court to rule on the issue as to (1) who are exempt and (2) what kind of sales is considered retail under the law. Under our Constitution, and in accordance with the time-honored separation of powers and division of duties in our democracy, the Supreme Court interprets the law and the Chief Executive enforces it. I urge the forbearance of all concerned while we await the decision of the Supreme Court. The high tribunal, meantime, has ruled that the national government has power over local governments in such justifiable controversies on national policy. We urge a proper respect for our legal traditions, especially upon those endowed with public authority.\r\nI have tried to sketch out, not necessarily in their order of importance, some of the important decisions that have been made in the first year of my administration. I believe that the wisdom of some of those decisions is borne out by recent and continuing developments in our national life. The impact of some of these decisions will not be felt for sometime. But these decisions have already begun to release dynamic energies that will accelerate our national growth. Too often, the harder choice is the correct choice. It takes courage to innovate. And progress requires innovation.\r\nLet us now look at the social and economic indicators of the past 12 months. In a way, these constitute tentative gauges of the wisdom of these policies and decisions. The only test of decisions is in the way they work for or against the people.\r\nAll the favorable economic indicators will remain unconvincing unless reflected in increased revenue collections which they are supposed to stimulate. In 1966, in spite of the fact that the economy had gone through hard times, total gross collections in revenue amounted to P2,304,700,119.70 as against P2,053,842,379.59 in 1965, or an increase of P250,857,740.11. Expressed in percentages, this was a dramatic 12.21% rise over the preceding year.\r\nThe new year gives hopeful signs of an even more dramatic rise in revenue collections. In January 1965, under the previous administration, customs collections were only P30 million. In January 1966, the collections reached P47 million. In January 1967, P47 million had been collected at the start of the third week, and the total collections by month\u2019s end are projected to be P65 million, or an increase of more than a hundred percent over the comparable period in 1965.\r\nThis performance is the direct result of administrative and managerial reforms in our tax collecting agencies and, in the case of the Bureau of Customs, of an expanded campaign to end all technical smuggling. Despite these gains, financing is still our main problem, as it is the main problem of every developing nation.\r\nThis rise in revenue collections supports the claim of increased business confidence in the government and in the future of the economy, the increased efficiency of the tax-gathering machinery, the success of antismuggling operations, and the buoyant trends in the economy as a whole under the spur of the administration\u2019s more positive economic policies.\r\nWe are now spending within acceptable limits, according to definite and realistic plans of development. Development has a price, which every responsive government must pay, and we are paying it, prudently and rationally.\r\nPerhaps the most telling proof that we have ridden out the fiscal crisis is this remarkable fact: In less than a year\u2019s time, we paid back the borrowings of the previous administration from the Central Bank in the amount of P250 million. The payment was made from cash receipts of the national treasury.\r\nThus, we have improved tremendously our treasury operations. The flow of cash from collection points all over the Philippines has been shortened from 45 to 7 days. This has strengthened the General Fund, an essential requirement in fiscal planning.\r\nWe have also introduced necessary reforms in local government tax administration, with the objective of stabilizing the finances of our local government units. With these reforms, we have improved correspondingly the financial position of the national government, while promoting true local autonomy by lessening the dependence of local units upon the national government for money.\r\nThe financial position of our government corporations has also improved.\r\nThe outstanding loans of P408 million held by the PNB from RCA, PNR, NAMARCO, NDC, and ACA have been reduced to P358.6 million; P328.2 million of which is secured by government funds or guaranteed by the national government. The Development Bank, which last year lost some P5 million, is now operating profitably. The Rice and Corn Administration has reduced its losses.\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that we have recovered from the financial and business crisis of 1965. Our first year in office has been devoted to making hard and painful decisions, to arresting deterioration, to restoring hope, faith, and confidence, to economic consolidation, and to laying the foundations for realistic growth. Even at this early date, signs of accelerated growth are apparent.\r\nMost of the present economic and production indicators show a robust growth. Agricultural production increased by 7.1%, a tremendous growth compared to the 1.2% decrease in 1965. Manufacturing grew by 9.2% and increased its share of national income from 17% to 20%. Nondurable manufactures grew by 8.3%, compared to 2.8% in 1965. Durable manufactures grew by 3.3%, compared to less than 0.01% in 1965.\r\nOur various industries showed renewed strength in 1966. Cement production increased in the first eight months of 1966 by 77.2%; fertilizers, by 278%; plywood, by 16.2%; cigarettes, by 13%; mining, by 8.8%. The textile industry, which was then operating on a one-shift-a-day, three-days-a-week schedule, is now operating on a three-shifts-a-day, full-week schedule. Textile production is up by 24% and textile sales by 27%.\r\nThe gross national product reached a new level of P21.3 billion, a growth of 7.9%. Per capita income increased from P518 to P539, or more than 4%.\r\nIn comparison, it should be remembered that in 1965, manufacturing was almost at a standstill. Credit was tight, accounts receivable were high, and many of our industries were shutting off production. We changed this situation decisively by relaxing credit, by refinancing distressed industries and by conducting an unrelenting campaign against both pure and technical smuggling. These measures were implemented without jeopardy to the value of our peso; in fact our currency became even stronger during this period of relaxation.\r\nThe reduction by the Central Bank of the required reserves of commercial banks, the abolition of the reserve requirements for special time deposits, and the readjustment upward of the rediscount ceilings of commercial banks considerably improved the financial position of the banking system and greatly enhanced its ability to meet the credit needs of trade and industry.\r\nAt the same time, we discovered a promising money market for government treasury bills. Some P130 million of 91-day treasury bills and P17.5 million of 182-day treasury bills have already been offered and used.\r\nDistressed industries which had closed or were closing were rescued by the Development Bank with P255.2 million in loans to 1,354 agricultural and industrial enterprises. They are now back in business. Nobody in December 1965 knew that these many enterprises were moribund. But we were shackled to them. If we were to recover, we had to resuscitate them.\r\nDBP offered last year P100 million worth of progress bonds to the public, and by year end 1966, had sold P108 million worth of bonds, indicating the growing confidence of the business community in the fiscal soundness of the government.\r\nFrom the beginning, we have had to face several difficult choices. We have had to choose between immediate gratification and long-term benefit. Wherever such a choice had to be made, as between the harder and the easier, we always chose the more difficult course. We avoided the path of least resistance and stagnation, and the illusion of safety that it brings. Instead, we opted for the challenge and risks of genuine national development.\r\nThis was very clear from the decision of the administration at the outset to relax credit and increase the funds at the disposal of both the public and private sectors. Thus, we deliberately assumed the risk of increasing prices. This is part of the price of development.\r\nThe buoyancy of prices under the propulsion of economic development can be an indicator of strength rather than a sign of weakness. The test is in the compensating factor of economic growth.\r\nAnother factor is social policy. Congress has adopted the policy of fixing the floor price of what is referred to as the index product\u2014rice. The increase was from P11.00 a cavan to P16.00 per cavan\u2014an increase of almost 50%. This went hand in hand with the enforcement of the new minimum wage law, adjusting floor wages to P6.00 from P4.00 for nonfarm workers and P3.50 from P2.00 for farm laborers. These wage adjustments were made through collective bargaining agreements in 1966. Because of these decisions in social policy, which were designed to help the masses of farmers and wage-earners, the price index could have risen much faster than it would otherwise normally have done.\r\nA choice had to be made between the apparent safety of stagnation and the risks of development. We chose the latter because we saw that restrictions on employment, production, and growth only stultified. We realized that stringent credit policies did not create new job opportunities. Stable prices meant little to the unemployed.\r\nI personally see this decision as a major break from the long tradition of temporizing with the problem of development. Before this administration, government leaders procrastinated, doubted, and refused to act, fearing the bugaboo of inflation. This we have now altered, irrevocably. We are committed to a bolder, but more prudent, course. We cannot realize a bright future for this nation with only a half-hearted commitment to development. We must act decisively and assume the risks that these entail. We must bring to the task of development the same courage, fervor, and boldness that have distinguished the Filipino in the battlefield. Israel and Taiwan have proved that manageable price increases should be allowed in order to stimulate growth.\r\nBusiness conditions were also improved by the adoption of antidumping measures on specified synthetics and chemicals, by a more aggressive antismuggling campaign, and the refinancing of distressed industries. From January 1 through December 31, 1966, the Bureau of Customs collected P745,139,475.04. This represents an increase of 15.83%, of P101,881,813.45, over Customs collections in 1965 for the same period.\r\nThe influx of untaxed cigarettes worth P93 million was reduced by 65%. Moreover, the number of smugglers caught increased by 33% over 1965, while the number of smuggling vehicles and vessels intercepted increased by 70%. This includes the forfeiture to the government of an ocean-going vessel, the SS Argo, with its cargo. This action, by the way, is a first in Philippine history.\r\nThe effects of these operations are reflected in increased production and sales of domestic manufacturers. Textile sales increased by 27%; local cigarettes, by 13%, earning an additional P34 million in taxes for the government, which represented a 19% increase from 1965 to 1966 compared to an increase of only 1.0% from 1964 to 1965. Taxes on imported cigarettes increased by 1059%, a telling indicator of the success of the antismuggling campaign.\r\nIn addition, we have prohibited the release of imports without consular invoices; directed a stricter supervision of embroidery and apparel establishments; and concluded an understanding with our major trading partners to provide information through Shippers\u2019 Export Declaration to minimize technical smuggling.\r\nOur dollar reserves of $165 million are higher than in 1965. The reserves rose to $216 million by around October of last year, but it went down after payments of dollar borrowings arising from the rice importations in 1962-1965 were made.\r\nBut all our efforts would have been meaningless if we could not protect the nation from dangers within and without. Development would be impossible in an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear. Our national productiveness is necessarily affected by the conditions under which our people work.\r\nIt is for this reason that we have not relaxed our vigilance. Our modest contributions towards the dismantling of the Indonesia-Malaysian confrontation, not to mention our peace and civic efforts in Vietnam, were dictated by our militant desire to guarantee for this and coming generations an uninterrupted epoch of national development.\r\nDevelopments in Indonesia dealt a severe blow to international Communism. We can now expect relative security in our southern frontier. Thus, we can shift our attention and effort to social and economic reforms.\r\nIn the past, we were mere spectators in the diplomatic scene; last year, we became responsible participants. On our initiative, a Seven-Nation Summit Conference was held in Manila, the purpose of which was to explore new avenues of peace in Vietnam and Asia. As a sovereign state, we could have elected to stand above the conflict, on the false notion that its outcome was irrelevant to the national interest. Instead, we chose to honor our commitments, which is the mark of national responsibility.\r\nThe agony of Vietnam is sometimes described as a \u201cwar of liberation.\u201d I do not think that we should equate liberation with totalitarian rule. This is a perversion of the meaning of freedom; no state is free to enslave its own people.\r\nWe know from historical experience that a state which enslaves its own people is merely taking the first step towards enslaving others. Are our memories so short that we have already forgotten the deeds of Hitler in Europe and Stalin in the Balkans?\r\nMy countrymen, we are in Vietnam because we want to survive in freedom. Our civic action in Vietnam stressed before the world our sense of national responsibility; our initiative for peace through the summit underscored our maturity in foreign affairs. Certainly, these actions identified us in Asia and before the world.\r\nFrom all accounts, the state visits to the United States and Japan were international successes. We went to these countries with head held high, for we did not go as supplicants. We spoke in the warm accents of a friend and ally, confident that the trust was reciprocal.\r\nIt would be insulting to our national dignity to quantify the results in purely material terms. Our friendship with the United States is based on a community of interests, and not on her willingness or capacity to do for us what we must do for ourselves. True, there are obligations on her part, as there are on ours; but these are subject to bargaining and negotiation. Our friendship, since it is founded on our commitment to democracy, is not\u2014and must never be\u2014negotiable.\r\nWe adopted a liberal view on travel to Communist countries. This gave some of our countrymen a chance to see for themselves what economists call the Russian and Chinese models. These travelers returned, I think, a bit wiser, and they are probably much wiser now because of recent developments on the Chinese mainland. It is unfortunate that other Filipinos who have been invited to Red China were denied permission. The foreign office invoked the maturity requirement; actually, it could not have sanctioned what looked like a pilgrimage.\r\nNot one of the visitors to these Communist countries has come out with a categorical statement that he is willing to pay the price of development demanded by the Russian or Chinese model. These visitors are jealous of their right to inquire and express themselves with great candor and liberty, and certainly, in a totalitarian society, they can only be mouthpieces of official doctrine. They returned with a recommendation for national discipline. They have not commended regimentation.\r\nOur relations with the United States have been the topic of sophisticated political discussions. It would be unrealistic to deny the necessity of reviewing these relations. As a matter of fact, Americans themselves, officials as well as private citizens, have initiated sometime ago what has since been called a Philippine-American dialogue.\r\nChanging conditions require a continuing review of agreements between our two countries. For this purpose, we have created an ad hoc study group composed of legislators, government officials, business leaders, and economists. Their municipal task is to reconsider the terms of these agreements within the context of our needs and interests as a developing nation in Asia.\r\nIt goes without saying that the review must be realistic. Some of us do not seem to realize the limitations of foreign policy. There are critics who naively believe that we can ordain the conditions of the external world, that they can be moved according to our sovereign disposition, that they can always be made to respond to our fiat. The conduct of policy is not like weaving a whole cloth according to an ideal design.\r\nDiplomacy is essentially a problem of ends and means. It is concerned with the pursuit of purposes, not always with their attainment. This is so because our ends must be proportionate to the means, and these also have their season. It is easy to conceive ends; the real task is in determining and acquiring the means.\r\nWe must remember that we conduct our diplomacy in the world as it is, not as it should be\r\nOur foreign policy contends with the policies of other nations, and its final character is often the result of compromise, as all other foreign policies are. We reflect, as a consequence, the consensus of that international community which we call democratic. Those who contend otherwise suggest that diplomacy operates in vacuo\r\nAs a result of our successful state visits to the United States and Japan, there has arisen a deplorable impression that we are overly concerned with foreign aid, that we are making our development contingent on such aid. We should not demean the importance of assistance from the outside. But we are not waiting for such help before starting our own major development efforts. We are committed to the full utilization of our own internal resources and opportunities for development. We have been tapping sources of financing in our own country. You have seen the highly successful selling of government bonds to realize developmental capital. We have, too, inaugurated the practice of private financing in the building of roads and bridges. This opens up a rich auxiliary source of capital for building the infrastructure. As the land reform program goes apace, more capital will be diverted from idle lands to business and industry. Thus, both our economic and social policies deliberately promote a national bias in favor of development.\r\nAt the inception of the administration in January 1966, the standing of the Philippine Republic with international lending institutions had reached its lowest ebb. The World Bank, by a formal letter of its president, gave notice of a loss of confidence in the ability of our government to honor its loan obligations and to put to good use borrowings from abroad. We ourselves did not know when projects being undertaken with foreign capital would be completed. Our deplorable performance for the four years, 1962-1965, on these projects hampered our negotiations for new loans.\r\nSome projects financed with foreign loans are NAWASA, which involves P204.8 million, of which $20.2 million is from the World Bank; the Angat Project of the National Power Corporation, of which $34 million is financed by the World Bank; the projects of the National Irrigation Administration for the repair of irrigation equipment; the MIA modernization loan of $5.6 million; the $15.5 million loan from the Development Loan Fund for the construction of roads and bridges; the World Bank loan of $6 million to the U.P. College of Agriculture; the Rural Credit Program of $5 million; and the dredging project of the Bureau of Public Works financed by the World Bank. Since we transferred half of the dredging fleet to the Philippine Navy, our production has increased threefold, and the cost of dredging has dropped from P2.30 per cubic meter to only P0.60 per cubic meter.\r\nFor the first time, a Presidential Action Officer was designated to coordinate all projects financed from foreign loans.\r\nA case in point was Pier 15. The project was behind schedule. In one year and a half, the private contractor for the project had finished only 16% of the work. It became necessary for the Bureau of Public Works to take over. In three months, 71% of the work was finished. The project has proceeded way ahead of schedule. Such impressive achievements in the last six months of 1966 on those infrastructure projects which are financed by foreign loans have restored the confidence in the capacity of our government to get things done. Indeed the vast improvement in project execution has been acknowledged by once-skeptical foreign bankers, who no longer doubt the administrative capacity of this government and are at last convinced that as a nation we have the necessary competence, resources, will, and determination to undertake purposeful economic development.\r\nWe were able to secure for the veterans, during the state visit to the United States, benefits which have been heretofore considered closed after repeated rejections:\r\nFirst, educational assistance not only for war orphans but also for the children of deceased or permanently disabled Filipino veterans;\r\nSecond, hospitalization benefits;\r\nThird, the payments of recognized veterans not paid arrears-in-pay and the refund to our veterans of unearned premiums of national service life insurance which had erroneously been deducted from their pay; and\r\nFourth, the payment of all veterans benefits at the rate of $0.50 for every peso, instead of the old rate of P1 to the dollar.\r\nThese benefits to Filipino veterans will contribute some $400 million to the national economy.\r\nEvery bona fide war veteran is a stockholder of the Philippine Veterans Bank. I am glad to note that this bank has doubled its resources from P31 million to P66 million in one year under this administration. As provided for under Republic Act 3518, the capital of the bank will come from funds generated by the Reparations Commission out of a $20 million allocation to the veterans. Since this administration took over, some P7.84 million have been transferred by the Reparations Commission to the Veterans Bank.\r\nOne of the immediate targets of our development program is to put the unemployment problem under control.\r\nAll our efforts to strengthen business and industry, and for that matter the entire development program, are intended ultimately to help the unemployed, the underemployed, and all the less privileged members of our society. This is a decisive departure from the make-work approach to employment, and dole-outs in the Emergency Employment Administration tradition which recent experiences have proved futile and, in the end, self-defeating and suicidal. The EEA is the path of least resistance. The harder choice is in directing capital towards permanent economic gains; a robust and growing economy will create, as a matter of course, the jobs needed by our workers. But, of course, the gains will not be apparent immediately.\r\nWe have chosen the harder course, we have consciously redirected the main flow of expenditures from nonproductive and nonessential government activities to private enterprise\u2014the productive sector. We have oriented the government to succor and resuscitate industries that had become moribund under the previous regime. The outcome has been favorable both to labor and to business and industry.\r\nThe latest statistics of the National Economic Council and the Central Bank show that in 1966, these development efforts realized 484,000 job opportunities, decreasing unemployment by a dramatic 10%, in spite of the fact that most of business and industry were still convalescing.\r\nThese new opportunities are stable and permanent, generated by heightened economic activity, rather than by government-induced crash programs on the EEA pattern. We have not, and we will not, resort to remedies and palliatives which only create artificial and temporary employment.\r\nAt the same time, we intensified the campaign to enforce labor laws in order to secure for the worker his due. In less than a year, this campaign has resulted in the restitution of wages amounting to P818,143.89 to 177,983 workers, in the payment of compensation benefits totaling P3,428,275.95 to victims of industrial accidents, and in the award of P293,134.80 to 2,061 employees.\r\nThe general improvement of the economy, together with effective government mediation, has also brought about industrial peace. Only 63 strikes were reported last year, most of which were speedily settled, as against 109 in 1965. This trend points to a maturing partnership between labor and capital, a kind of partnership essential to a just, enduring, and creative peace in industry.\r\nFor the first time since the Social Security System was established in 1957, the services of SSS will be brought directly to member-workers and employees in all provinces and cities. This will be accomplished through a decentralization program to be started on February 1. Regional and provincial offices will be created throughout the country. With this, it is expected that 400,000 more workers will be covered by the Social Security System. Red tape will be cut down and services materially improved. Under this administration, social security benefits have been significantly increased: sickness benefit by about 40%; death benefit for seasonal workers by 25%; total disability benefit by about 200%; and retirement benefit by an average of 60%.\r\nAlso worthy of mention is the SSS educational assistance scheme for students and parents of schoolchildren. Coupled with this is the SSS scholarship program which will help poor but deserving students acquire the education they deserve. The assets of the Social Security System increased by 17% over the same period last year. Benefit payments increased by around P5 million over 1965.\r\nThe Government Service Insurance System succeeded in reversing unfavorable initial trends by returning to its fundamental function of providing security and shelter to its members. Additional insurance coverages during the year 1966 totaled P253 million. Claims and benefits paid to retirees, deceased members, and other claims totaled P82.6 million during 1966. During the year, the GSIS, in line with its objective of giving more insurance benefits to its members, has increased housing loans, particularly to retirees and the low-salaried employees of the Philippine government. Apart from the 500-bed GSIS hospital in Quezon City, the system has financed low-cost housing in DavaoCity, Project 8-C in Quezon City, and the PNR property in Rizal.\r\nSoon after our administration began, we inaugurated a land reform program based on the Agricultural Land Reform Code, and put the implementation of the law for the first time on a serious level. The declaration of the 2nd District of Pampanga as a land reform area put an end to two decades of official temporizing and hedging over land reform. I regard this as a militant thrust beyond land reform into the wide open field of social regeneration. Until this was done, land reform was a utopian dream or an agitator\u2019s delight. With this single act, land reform has become a feasible program of government.\r\nWe have also activated the Land Bank. The government\u2019s Plaza Militar property has been offered for sale, the proceeds to be used as capital of the bank. Land reform, however, has its own schedule of priorities, and at present the most important is the conversion of tenant farmers into leaseholders or independent farm managers. This is financed by the Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA). Later, the Land Bank will engage in land acquisition and distribution, as well as in the redirection of idle capital from land to industry.\r\nHappily, the Pampanga experiment has been going on smoothly, with both tenants and landowners cooperating admirably in the implementation of this history-making project. For fear of its success, however, I understand the Huks have reversed themselves on land reform and are actively obstructing its progress in Pampanga. This has exposed the Huks for what they are.\r\nFor us, the aim of land reform is to modernize our vast rural sector\u2014to release latent energies locked up by obsolescent tenancy.\r\nConsistent with the spirit of land reform, we have also provided land, in the form of home-lots and family-size farms, to 1,827 landless families. We also resettled 574 families, including victims of the Taal Volcano eruption, and provided each of them a farm lot to till.\r\nMoreover, we have increased various forms of assistance to the farmers.\r\nLast year, we released farm loans amounting to P15,713,140.77 to 31,369 fanners, representing an increase of 58% over 1965. We provided extension service to 908,610 farms and rendered free legal assistance to 64,944 farm tenants.\r\nThe people\u2019s support and participation are essential to democratic progress.\r\nWe have, therefore, revived the community development program which had become moribund under the previous administration.\r\nIn less than a year, we have increased community development projects by 150% over 1965. In terms of community participation, the increase was over 500%. We have organized 25,000 community projects involving more than a million people. In response to the challenge of self-help, 18,000 projects were undertaken by the people themselves, with their own resources.\r\nWe have sought to awaken the bayanihan spirit in our people. Their response over a wide part of the country has been spectacular.\r\nIn public health, we have launched the Malaria Eradication Program which will wipe out malaria in the Philippines. The World Health Organization and the Agency for International Development are helping in this program. The Department of Health has started the TB Control Program which aims to immunize 1 million children a year. At this rate, the population in due time will be immune to this disease. I have directed the Department of Health to enforce more aggresively the Food and Drug Act in order to safeguard the public against illicit drug manufacturers and dealers. Rural health centers have been reinforced in equipment, personnel, and services rendered.\r\nFor the first time in many years, we had no admission crisis in the public schools. Positive steps have been taken to improve the quality of instruction on all levels of the educational system. Incentives, short of direct subsidies, will be given to private schools in order to help them develop their curricula in the physical and natural sciences, social sciences, and technology. We are working hard to improve academic standards.\r\nThe general improvement of the economic situation, including rising employment, has told on crime.\r\nI can say that on a nationwide basis, crime is now under control. Excluding Metropolitan Manila, crime decreased per 100,000 people by 4.8%, from 9.9% in 1965 to 35.1% in 1966. This has, however, been obscured by the increase of crime in Manila, which increased by 18.4% for major offenses and 23.8% for minor offenses from 1965 to 1966. It is clear that more attention must now be given to crime in Manila.\r\nOver the years, so much has been said about graft and corruption as a characteristic feature of our government. We have refused to accept this feature as permanent because that is cynical. Under this administration, the most serious efforts are being made to stamp out corruption, by making the cost of corruption prohibitive. Indifference and collusion are things of the past; under this administration, stem corrective measures are applied at once, or punishments summarily imposed on all cases of official corruption. There is not a single reported case of venality on which action has not been taken. The effect on the bureaucracy and on officialdom has been salutary.\r\nWe have acted decisively to meet the challenge of corruption in the very loci of infection\u2014the Philippine Constabulary, the Bureau of Customs, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue. A complete and massive reorganization of these offices, involving change of personnel and reassignments, has just been finished. The close ties between members of the Constabulary and smugglers have been sundered.\r\nA drastic reorganization in the Armed Forces, including the Constabulary, has resulted in the expulsion of undesirables and a higher level of discipline and responsibility. In the Bureau of Customs alone, 107 officials and employees were charged criminally or administratively in 1966. During the year in the BIR, 183 officials and employees were charged with various offenses. Of these cases, 33 were decided by the Civil Service Commission, and 12 persons were dismissed. The comparable record in 1965 was 68 employees charged, two cases decided, and none dismissed. As a matter of fact, more officials and employees were subjected to disciplinary action in these areas in one year of the present administration than in all the four years of the previous administration. In the removal of 80,000 casual employees, reemployment was denied to those who had been linked to cases of dishonesty or inefficiency.\r\nSubstantial as these achievements against corruption are, we have hardly begun.\r\nThe failure of justice\u2014the inability of the people to get it on time\u2014undermines popular faith in democracy. Our task, therefore, is to demonstrate the efficiency and impartiality of democratic justice.\r\nWe have called on our courts to speed up the disposition of cases. The response has been encouraging, but still inadequate. Last year, a record increase in cases disposed was registered: 47,658 as against only 44,122 in 1965. For the first time, we have also caused the trial, conviction, and sentence of smugglers in two-and-a-half months after the filing of the case. This was in Batangas Court of First Instance.\r\nWe have carried on the tasks of development under the shadow of a grave threat to our open society\u2014internal subversion. The PKP/HMB have not abandoned their objective of organizing a Communist society in the Philippines, but have merely shifted their strategy, after their defeats in battle in 1949 and 1950, to a legal and parliamentary struggle to overthrow the constitutional government.\r\nIn the very recent past, complacency about this threat led to strange alliances between Huks and elements of the Armed Forces. It would be reckless on our part to ignore the seriousness of the problem today.\r\nWe have decisively confronted this threat both by programs of social reform and by military action. Through the Central Luzon Development Program, substantial gains in public works and social development projects as well as in the struggle to win the hearts and minds of men have been made. In fact, the situation in Central Luzon has significantly improved on the side of freedom.\r\nThis is only the briefest outline of a massive, serious effort in development.\r\nIn general, the administration has had a hopeful start. But we are not content\u2014we have to do more and more each time more than the last to create for our people higher incomes, better health and welfare facilities, adequate infrastructure, improved transportation and communication systems, and all the other benefits of modern civilization.\r\nThese accomplishments were made possible by the admirable cooperation of Congress. I cite particularly the laws authorizing the increase of our foreign borrowing authority and our domestic bond floatation ceiling; the increase in our subscription to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; and the authorization of funds for the NAWASA Interim Waterworks Project for Manila which was a condition by the World Bank for considering further loans to the Philippine government.\r\nThis year, the government must set itself the following objectives:\r\nFirst, increase government income to meet the expanding needs of a society in the process of modernization;\r\nSecond, build more roads and bridges, ports, and harbors, irrigation and power facilities, and establish the foundations for long-term growth;\r\nThird, increase the productive capacity of our domestic industries;\r\nFourth, expand domestic trade and commerce and increase the efficiency of our marketing system;\r\nFifth, attract more capital, both domestic and foreign, to strengthen our country\u2019s capacity to sustain, in the future, and by itself, the growth initiated in the early stages of development;\r\nSixth, implement a realistic program for rice and corn and other prime commodities;\r\nSeventh, incorporate in existing socioeconomic plans an adequate program of housing and urban development;\r\nEighth, expand and diversify our export trade and its market;\r\nNinth, gear the governmental machinery to the requirements of economic development by adopting long-term measures to modernize the administrative system;\r\nTenth, end the wanton destruction of our natural resources, particularly our forests and our marine life;\r\nEleventh, assure labor of its share of the incomes generated by government policies, and continue the fight against unemployment;\r\nTwelfth, strive continuously to maintain peace and order throughout the country, and minimize the effects of resurgent subversion among the economically underprivileged.\r\nOn these imperatives, we have developed interrelated programs of action, each one an integral part of one basic document, our Four-Year Economic Program. These programs, whether in terms of physical targets for public works or social and economic objectives, have been drawn up in an orderly manner, and different from the improvised, crisis-to-crisis approach of the past years. They may well represent, at this time, our clearest and best hope for development.\r\nTo gear the governmental machinery to economic development, I have asked Congress for authority to reorganize, in one year, the executive departments, offices, agencies, and instrumentalities of the government. I will also certify to this Congress the proposed Administrative Code; preliminary recommendations to this effect have been recently submitted to the Office of the President. Copies of the proposed Administrative Code will be presented to Members of Congress next month.\r\nGovernment corporations have been established to pioneer in certain enterprises too forbidding or too costly for private business to undertake. They were\u00b7organized to serve the public. Of late, however, some government corporations have either ceased to pioneer or stopped serving the public interests. They have become a burden to government and an obstacle to private initiative. It is time that they are liquidated. A reassessment of these corporations is in order and will be carried out.\r\nThere are several other positive measures I have approved that will transform the government into a more effective instrument of national policy. I have implemented the recommendations of a Management Audit Committee to realign functions in the various divisions of my office, and to delegate certain activities to the line departments. This will allow my immediate staff members to concentrate on more important work.\r\nWe have also transferred the Arrastre Service to the private sector and thereby greatly reduced pilferage in the piers.\r\nTo improve our work on projects financed with foreign loans, I have appointed a Presidential Action Officer whose primary task is to oversee their early and successful completion.\r\nRegional Public Administration Seminars are being held in all the agencies and offices of the government to acquaint all officials and employees with the government\u2019s economic development program. A course in Development Economics has been prescribed for technicians in operating agencies. This joint program of the University of Wisconsin and the University of the Philippines is in line with our effort to improve the planning and programming functions in the government.\r\nBy promoting efficiency, economy, and simplicity in public administration, and by allocating properly the functions of government, we hope to increase inter-agency cooperation and approximate more closely our ideal of government.\r\nFinally, the cooperation and assistance of the private sector have been sought and received. As a result of a dialogue between the Management Association of the Philippines and representatives of the government agencies, initial steps have been taken to insure harmony and satisfactory working relations with private entrepreneurs and managers. This dialogue will continue.\r\nIn 1966 the government built up new irrigation systems and improved old ones which resulted in irrigating additional 60,664 hectares of farmland, as against 17,785 the previous year, or an increase of 300%. The additional 26,679 hectares brought under irrigation by the Irrigation Service Unit alone more than equaled the total of 25,699 hectares irrigated in eight years by the past two administrations.\r\nWe have built 110 kilometers of concrete roads as against only 70 kilometers in the four years of the previous regime. We have also built 1,948 linear meters of bridges.\r\nA total of 724 schoolhouses have been built, making available some 17,000 new classrooms. Many of these are schoolhouses of the Marcos type, said to be capable of withstanding typhoons.\r\nPortworks have been vigorously carried out. Three new berths for domestic ships and three others for overseas vessels are now almost finished. In addition, 258,028 cubic meters of sediments have been dredged during the same period.\r\nWe have not overlooked flood control. Nine major flood control projects and 56 minor ones have been undertaken, thus insuring half a million people and 20,000 hectares against floods.\r\nWe have expanded and improved seven airports, namely: Cotabato, Daet, Catarrnan, Wasig, Itbayat, Virac, and Calbayog. Iloilo\u2019s should be finished in a few months.\r\nIn the field of communications, 22 telecom projects have been installed in 22 municipalities. Moreover, the Baguio-Manila microwave link, a part of the national telecommunications network, has been completed.\r\nIn a decision that is precedent-breaking, we have organized an engineer brigade in the Armed Forces with 10 engineer construction battalions. They are being used to build and repair public works. The most dramatic proof of the wisdom of this decision is the speed of the work done in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, the Manila North Diversion Road, and the Manila South Diversion Road.\r\nOn infrastructure, we have developed a coherent plan of action to give the economy the physical support required for self-sustained growth.\r\nOur primary program is to expand our irrigation systems.\r\nWe have a gap in agriculture to bridge. This may well be called the \u201cdry gap.\u201d The crying need of the hour is irrigation. The efficient use of production inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds depends on an adequate supply of water.\r\nWhen I came to office, the official statistics showed that irrigation systems supposedly constructed served about 1 million hectares of agricultural land. Actual survey showed only about 300,000 hectares were irrigated. This involved an error of 70%. We have had to meet such gross errors in the conduct of government.\r\nMoreover, we found numerous irrigation systems in a deplorable state of neglect and many other projects started and abandoned. The irrigation program we subsequently formulated envisioned the repair of the 79 national systems as first priority, and the construction of 52 new projects to irrigate 200,000 hectares of new lands with the national gravity systems as second priority.\r\nTo start the program, we recently committed P40 million in resources for the irrigation of 120,000 hectares of land by the end of the next fiscal year. We will commit another P60 million soon to realize as fast as we can our targets.\r\nLike highway development, the price of irrigation is high. But there is no alternative. We would not once again neglect to maintain the irrigation systems we construct. We would not once again fail to operate efficiently these facilities because our failure will mean the continued shortages of staple crops.\r\nWe will also build a modern highway system. We made a start last year, by constructing 110 kilometers of concrete roads. (The Macapagal administration built an average of 37 kilometers of national concrete roads per year.) Over the next three years, we will enter into a season of building without equal in the past.\r\nWe have programmed in that period the construction of 900 kilometers of developmental roads and 3,000 kilometers of feeder roads; the improvement by concrete and asphalt paving of over 5,000 kilometers of existing roads; and the replacement of 60,000 lineal meters of temporary bridges with permanent structures. Our more immediate physical targets include completing 700 kilometers of concrete pavement, 200 kilometers of asphalt roads, and 200 kilometers of feeders roads; replacing 425 temporary bridges; and completing the two-lane portion of the Manila North Diversion Road, the Manila South Diversion Road from Harrison Boulevard in Manila to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in Pasay City, as well as the Nagtahan Bridge. For these projects, we have released P183 million from the Highway Special Fund, the General Fund, and bond issues.\r\nWe intend to utilize these resources well by using fully existing equipment and by adopting turnkey and toll road schemes for selected projects.\r\nTo organize a comprehensive system of ports and harbors throughout the country and to relieve the congestion at our national ports, we intend to construct an additional 400 berths to be distributed in strategic areas. In addition, we will soon reclaim 871 hectares of foreshore lands and dredge some 40 million cubic meters to meet future navigational depth requirements. These measures will relieve the congestion at the Port of Manila, and by developing alternate ports at San Fernando, La Union, and Batangas, Batangas, prepare the way for an adequate national system of ports and harbors.\r\nFurthermore, for aviation, we will add another runway to the ManilaInternationalAirport suitable for supersonic transports. We will improve existing facilities in our other major airports. These measures will provide for our growing domestic and international air traffic and secure for our country a larger share of the Pacific tourist trade.\r\nEvery year we spend $100 million to ship our products. Philippine registered vessels account for only 7.9% of this total. This means that every year we spend more than $900 million to use foreign ships. Philippine merchant shipping should account for at least 30% of this total. The NASSCO originally planned to acquire four to six ships; now the new plan is for 12 ships; later the NASSCO will buy 48 ships. It may be preferable to take the initiative in the acquisition of ships. The Philippine government will guarantee repayment within a certain period of amortization.\r\nShipping and portworks are related. Shipping on foreign bottoms costs us so much because our ports are badly maintained. It is necessary to put 104 additional foreign and domestic berths. There must be a reclamation of 871 hectares of port areas, and 140,730 square meters of transit sheds. For the port of Manila, we need 14 additional berths for overseas vessels and seven additional berths for domestic ships.\r\nWe plan to increase our merchant fleet every year until 1969.\r\nIn the last 12 months, this administration has built more schoolbuildings than the last administration in three years. However, there are still thousands of classrooms and schoolbuildings all over the country that are in disrepair. These classrooms are unhealthy and dangerous; they also discourage proper learning and teaching.\r\nMy administration has a program for constructing more than 60,000 classrooms from 1966 through 1970. This program will cost more than P257 million. But even so, this will only meet 75% of our present classroom requirements.\r\nBeginning next month, we will start a P51 million schoolbuilding program that will eventually produce more than 20,000 classrooms.\r\nOur development program impels us to look for new sources of capital.\r\nWhile I am grateful to Congress for increasing our borrowing capacity, I must say that this is not enough. Foreign creditors are asking us what we are doing to help ourselves. It is now time for Congress to legislate new sources of revenue.\r\nNew revenues will be needed to repay debts incurred in financing public\u00b7works projects. As one of the possible sources, we are contemplating the sale of idle government lands in order to supplement government income raised through taxation, and to open unused government lands to private investors.\r\nThe manufacture of steel and metal products will be encouraged. In this regard, we are prepared, first, to discourage proliferation in strategic industries through credit priorities and tax incentives, and second, to undertake a comprehensive reform of our tax and tariff structures so that high-priority industries will receive adequate economic guarantees and protection.\r\nWe will again propose to Congress an investment incentives bill to attract domestic and foreign investment in preferred areas of economic activity such as mining, iron and steel manufacturing, deep-sea fishing, shipbuilding, and the manufacture of agricultural machinery.\r\nIncentives such as accelerated depreciation of assets and carryover of losses will be granted. I must emphasize that more incentives will be given to domestic investors, or to joint-venture arrangements in which Filipino, rather than foreign, participation is greater. This is only consistent with our policy of giving first consideration to our own citizens so that they can accumulate capital.\r\nNew development opportunities in the Philippines have caught the attention of major investors abroad. We welcome such investments, especially for infrastructure or groundbreaking projects. What are some of these offers?\r\nLe Nickel of France, Sheritt-Gordon of Canada, and three American companies have offered to develop the Surigao ferronickel deposits with a possible total investment of $300 million. The proposals are being assessed.\r\nA Belgian and an Italian offer for power development, a West German offer for various public works projects, a Dutch offer for reclamation and port development are on file. They are being explored.\r\nThe most aggressive offers have been received from American and Japanese companies. Several Japanese firms have offered to construct all the sugar mills we need. We need five new sugar mills, each with a rated capacity of three thousand tons a day\u2014three for Negros, one for Cebu, and one for Batangas. American financiers have offered to construct on a turnkey basis three sugar mills. They are even ready to finance the development of new sugar districts in Mindanao. Some American firms have offered to finance a $300 million road building project on the condition that a group of Filipino contractors enter into a financing arrangement with them.\r\nSeveral large Japanese firms have shown interest in the construction of the bridges in Cagayan, between Cebu and Mactan, and between Samar and Leyte. The same Japanese firms have offered to enter into partnership with Filipino contractors in road building, irrigation, and portworks construction.\r\nSeveral American and Japanese firms have offered to sell to the Philippine government, on a deferred payment basis, heavy construction equipment worth $20 million to $50 million. There are other American and Japanese offers for road building, irrigation, and other public works construction which are still being investigated.\r\nAs soon as our technical men have assessed these offers, we will enter into agreements with these firms.\r\nEarlier, I said that one of the great decisions I had to make was this: follow a policy of convenience and stagnation or assume the risks of moving forward. I chose the latter. As we released more funds to stimulate economic activity, a certain buoyancy in the price structure was naturally the outcome. The rise in the overall price index averaged 4.8%. This was led by the rise in the price of foodstuffs. This means that food supply has still to catch up with the growing population and rising income levels. The stepped-up food production under this administration is therefore serving a double purpose\u2014increasing sufficiency in the staple crops and promoting a greater long-term stability of prices.\r\nThe redistributive social policy behind the minimum wage law, which increased floor wages from P4 to P6 in nonfarm employment, andP2.50 to P3.50 in agriculture, has helped stimulate prices. So has the increase in the floor price of palay from P11 to P16 a cavan.\r\nIn the past, prices were kept relatively stable by artificial price controls which were maintained at great cost to our economy.\r\nUnder the previous administration, the government lost P497 million to control the price of rice. In 1963, the government imported rice at a cost of P1.71 per ganta and sold it at P0.80, resulting in a loss of P0.91 per ganta. In 1964, the government imported rice again at P1.52 per ganta and sold it at P1.30, or a loss of P0.22 per ganta. In 1965, it cost the government P1.98 per ganta to import rice: It was sold at P1.15, or a loss of P0.83. The total loss in 1962-1963 was P66 million; in 1963-1964, P144 million; in 1964-1965, P88 million; and in 1965, an election year, the loss was P199 million.\r\nThis bread-and-circus policy was wisely reversed by Congress in 1966 by adopting the policy of the Rice and Corn Administration not to sell at a loss. This is the only acceptable policy.\r\nAside from the drain on badly needed government resources, the policy of the previous administration siphoned away substantial amount of foreign exchange, and hindered the development of local industries. The sad fact about this policy of artificial stability is that prices kept going up despite these measures.\r\nWorse, the price stabilization arms of the government were rendered bankrupt and inoperative by past profligacy. Vast storehouses of canned goods were found spoiled and unfit even for animals. The RCA could not account for its last rice importation of 600,000 tons, which was supposed to be available in December 1965 but was not. Far from helping stabilize prices, the rehabilitation of these agencies constitutes a severe drain on government resources.\r\nThe National Marketing Corporation has been refused further credit by the Philippine National Bank. If it must exercise its function of price stabilization, the NAMARCO must look for financial assistance elsewhere.\r\nA promise to hold down prices is empty and misleading. What this administration seeks to do is to attack the price problem at the root.\r\nWe intend to keep prices down by increasing the production of prime commodities, especially rice and corn. We hope to be self-sufficient within a few years. By implementing vigorously coordinated programs of production, including the use of high-yielding seeds like IR-8, BPI-76, and C-18, which yield 100 cavans per hectare, agricultural production should develop even faster than its present 7.1% annual increase. The proper government agencies will provide, in support, incentives to our farmers, including production credit, marketing facilities, and research assistance. Through government initiative in 1966, the high-yielding IR-8 was propagated and accepted by the farmer. By May 1967, we hope to have enough of this seed to be able to propagate it more widely.\r\nWe are concluding studies on the establishment of farmers\u2019 markets in important production areas, with facilities to store and distribute grain and other farm produce. A fishing and marketing complex in Navotas, patterned along the lines of these farmers\u2019 markets, will soon be started with the help of the Japanese government.\r\nSelf-sufficiency in rice and corn is a major goal of the nation. Thus, I have made it a principal concern of my administration. Most of the projects in public works and agriculture bear directly on rice and corn. In terms of funds channeled through agricultural extension work, farm loans, community development, technical education, pest control, irrigation, and other infrastructure projects, an estimated P200 million is devoted to the task of increasing rice and corn productivity. The PNB has made available another P150 million in credit assistance.\r\nThis bold commitment to rice production is warranted by the fact that while our population increases at the rate of 3.2% annually, the increase in rice production in the last 12 years was only 1.7%. Our average yield per hectare is 28 cavans, one of the lowest in the consumption requirements. Likewise, the average yield per hectare of corn is less than 12 cavans per hectare, one of the lowest in the world.\r\nWe have enough seeds now of the seedboard variety, like IR-8, BPI-76, C-18, for dry season planting, and we will have enough for wet season planting by May.\r\nFor the first time in the history of our agriculture, we have succeeded in producing enough seeds through agreements with private landowners as seed cooperators, whereby we purchase all the seeds they can produce.\r\nSuch a strong effort is all the more necessary in the face of the warning made by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that all of the world will go hungry in five years unless food production is increased very substantially.\r\nApropos of this, it has been observed that there is once again market speculation on rice because of the announcements of deficiencies this year. This points up the need to have an adequate buffer stock of rice and corn to protect otherwise defenseless consumers. In this regard, I should like to announce that necessary steps have been taken to bring about this safeguard. The government will be in a position in just a few weeks to flood the market with rice. We have entered into agreements with foreign suppliers to meet the deficiency certified by the National Economic Council. In 1966, we realized a corn surplus for the first time. I hope that in a year or two the same can be said of rice.\r\nTo help promote and expand foreign trade, I have submitted to Congress a bill proposing the creation of a National Export Trade Authority. This will promote Philippine products abroad, coordinate the export-promotion function of government agencies, and prevent further imbalances in trade by providing government assistance to export-oriented industries, simplifying export procedures, and regulating the quality of Philippine exports.\r\nI am submitting for consideration by this Congress measures to industrialize and stabilize our problem-beset abaca industry. The progressive decline in the price of this commodity, accelerated by the inroads of synthetics and current heavy disposals of foreign stockpiles, discouraged production, reduced incomes, and diminished export receipts. We should strive to maintain abaca prices at remunerative levels, discover new uses for the fiber, and undertake more domestic processing of the product.\r\nRight now we have a team in Washington which is conducting discussions on the technical level on how to cushion the impact on abaca prices should the U.S. government reduce its stockpile.\r\nWe have proposed the establishment of an International Research Institute for Coconut, similar to the IRRI, which will serve as a regional center for the improvement of coconut production. We are also taking steps to stabilize the price of copra.\r\nUnder Republic Act No. 4155, 50% of all tobacco taxes, amounting to about P80 million, is created as a special fund channeled to the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration. Out of this, only about P45 million is used by the PVTA for its trading and subsidy program and the balance or excess is used to settle past obligations with the Central Bank or the Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration (now Agricultural Credit Administration). It is now time to restudy whether this excess should be used for other agricultural programs like rice.\r\nStudies are also going on to transfer the burden of buying domestic tobacco from the farmer at favorable prices from the PVTA to the private sector, particularly the cigarette manufacturers. I suggest that Congress participate in these studies.\r\nIn 1965, our sugar production fell short by 100,000 tons of our quota in the U.S. market. This obliged our government to notify the U.S. government formally that we could not meet our quota. Fortunately, our quota was not reduced. But again, last year, because of the drought, typhoons, and floods, the sugar producers manifested their fears that the shortage might reach up to 200,000 tons. As a result, we took steps to convince sugar planters to discard the old sugar quota system, which has been a source of venalities and trade malpractices. Consequently, the sugar producers have agreed to discard the old quota system and to allow the organization of five sugar districts and mills; three in Negros, one in Cebu, and one in Batangas. At the same time, some financiers are studying the establishment of a sugar district and mill in Mindanao.\r\nThe crux of the problem in sugar appears to lie in the fact that the cost of production in most of our sugar areas is 3.5 to 4.5 cents a pound while the world market price is only 1.6 cents per pound. The sugar industry, with the help of our government, must find the means to improve its competitive position through increased productivity. What is more important is that we must not fail to take advantage of our privilege market in the United States where the price is $0.07 per pound.\r\nIn no other field has the administration so clearly demonstrated its capacity for the harder choice than in forest conservation. At the outset, we were faced with the choice of carrying on the policies of the former administration, which were safe and convenient, or inaugurating new policies at the risk of inflaming a major industry against the administration. We chose the latter. We insisted in banning log dealers and in requiring processing plants for wood products as a condition for the grant for forest licenses. We are warned that our export receipts would fall off drastically as a result of this policy. I am glad that these fears have been proved unfounded; we have experienced the incidental benefit of cutting out illegal exportations of logs. We have regulated uneconomic logging which has led to depredations of our forests. We require loggers to plant two trees for every tree that is destroyed or cut, and this has induced many loggers to establish their own nurseries for the replenishment of their logging areas. Logging concessionaires are now deputized to arrest violators of forest conservation laws in their respective areas.\r\nI will propose a bill providing incentives for wood processing and reforestation. This will enable us to raise the money for the reforestation of denuded areas, the relocation of kaingin farmers, and the employment of more rangers to police our forests. This will allow us also to lift the tax on domestic sales of logs to give our domestic wood-processing industry a competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers without loss of revenue on our part. I am also thinking of raising the share of the government in the exploitation of our forest resources.\r\nWe have begun well with the implementation of two measures: first, prohibiting the acquisition of concessions in excess of 100,000 hectares; and the second, ending the renewal of concessions that are less than 20,000 hectares, to prevent the proliferation of uneconomic forest concessions. Existing forest conservation laws will be enforced strictly. Punitive measures will be taken against loggers who violate these laws.\r\nIt is needless to remind you of the evil effects of forest vandalism. It jeopardizes P500 million worth of irrigation systems. I view with alarm the drying-up of a number of existing irrigation systems and the reduction of the water supply available for irrigation. This can be traced directly to the destruction of watersheds.\r\nIt is now time for Congress to formulate a more comprehensive and effective policy on forest conservation.\r\nTo conserve our fishery resources, we have designated the Philippine Navy to take full command and responsibility for all operations of the various government agencies against illegal fishing. In addition, we will propose legislation, first, to define clearly the national and local jurisdictions over freshwater areas, to delineate fishing areas, and to prescribe fishing methods; second, to provide the Fisheries Commission with funds to enable it to employ more technical personnel; and third, to strengthen present conservation laws through the adoption of supplemental provision.\r\nI will widen conservation to include restocking of wildlife, prevention of air and water pollution, the silting of harbors, rivers, and waterways, and safeguarding against the loss of archaeological and historical artifacts. We are destroying these with wanton indifference. I find this intolerable and I will use every means at my disposal to check this destruction of national wealth.\r\nOur livestock industries lack feeds, particularly grain and concentrates.\r\nLast year, a good crop of corn increased the feed supply, but much more remains to be done before we can definitely arrest the downtrend in livestock production which had been apparent in the past five years.\r\nWe are conducting a nationwide cattle survey with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program. This survey will determine our plans for the cattle and dairy industries.\r\nWe also propose to expand the number of milk collection centers in selected areas of the country to provide a ready market for the milk produce of our fanners. Early this year, a milk collection center will be established by the Bureau of Animal Industry in Central Luzon. At least two others will be set up during the year.\r\nWe also envision the establishment of a livestock auction market for hogs and cattle and floating meatworks to be undertaken by the private sector.\r\nThese tremendous efforts at the development of our economy are overwhelming, but they would be meaningless should we fail to relate them to the continuing welfare and security of our people. We must therefore devote more attention to social development. We should give our children better education, we should expand public health services particularly in rural areas, we should enhance the productive capabilities of our people, and we should promote attitudes and values conducive to the establishment of a viable and humane social order.\r\nEducation is central in our plans for national development. Our allocation for public education is 30% of the total annual budget of the national government. This percentage is already one of the highest for all countries, including the rich industrialized countries.\r\nThe main portion of this amount, more than P60 million, is spent on lower education. However, lower education adds little or nothing to the skilled manpower pool of the country since these skills are produced by vocational schools and colleges and universities. I might add it is these skills that are economically significant and socially desirable. It is therefore necessary to integrate our educational programs with the economic effort of the nation, especially with manpower development.\r\nScience teaching is necessary for our development programs. I have directed the Department of Education to revitalize the science courses in our public high schools. In cooperation with the University of the Philippines, the Department of Education has worked out a scheme to improve high school science teaching.\r\nThe Department of Education is also negotiating a project with the National Science Development Board, under which 90 selected high schools will be provided with basic science teaching equipment over a four-year period. The equipment will be manufactured by government trade schools on the prototypes developed by the U.P.ScienceTeachingCenter.\r\nThe need to have a strong healthy nation makes it imperative for us to revitalize athletics in the country. The declining performance of Filipino athletes in international competitions has aroused public opinion. We are launching a long-range integrated national program of sports development which will involve students in public and private schools, colleges and universities, the members of the Armed Forces, and private firms.\r\nWe shall continue to secure for labor a fair share of the incomes and profits resulting from policies favorable to business and industry. And to make this possible, the growth of free and democratic trade unionism as well as the participation of labor in wage-fixing dialogues shall be encouraged.\r\nLabor and capital must be partners not only in production but also in progress.\r\nTo reduce further unemployment and raise labor productivity, we shall expand and intensify our placement services and step up systematic manpower development through the newly established Manpower Development Council.\r\nThis year, we propose to put greater emphasis on urban development and housing than before. The healthy growth of our cities and towns depends on what we plan for them now. Housing conditions are getting worse and urban squatter colonies are increasing at the rate of 12% yearly. We cannot let this situation deteriorate further.\r\nIt is now time to incorporate into our long-term socioeconomic plans adequate and practical programs for urban development and housing.\r\nOne such program is the establishment of savings and loans associations to finance low-cost housing schemes all over the country. I believe that we should also tell our financial institutions to reexamine their policies regarding housing loans. More incentives should be given in the future to low-cost housing to keep up with our population growth.\r\nOn my instructions, the Social Security Commission and the Department of Labor have undertaken a study towards the institution of an unemployment insurance scheme for the first time in the Philippines. A bill creating this scheme will be presented to Congress for its consideration during this session.\r\nFor the first time, a serious effort has been initiated under the present administration to control the proliferation of welfare agencies and services, both public and private, and to maximize their usefulness under an integrated program. This is just the beginning. The next three years will see more initiatives on the humanitarian front.\r\nThe Social Welfare Administration has initiated a new service for the rehabilitation of ex-prisoners. At the same time, relief activities have been carried out successfully for victims of natural catastrophes such as the Taal Volcano eruption, typhoons, floods, and fires.\r\nI fully endorse the early enactment of House Bill No. 7324, now with the Senate, which seeks to improve and update the present Armed Forces Retirement Law. This is necessary for the maximum utilization of the useful years of professionally competent members of our Armed Forces.\r\nThe fight against corruption will be accelerated this year. We shall not countenance political interference in favor of the corrupt official or employee. Party affiliations and political debt will not be taken into account if, at all, they will work in reverse, inviting a presumption of guilt rather than that of innocence.\r\nDespite the commendable performance of our trial judges, we are still faced with a huge backlog of pending cases, which added up to 82,363 at the close of the year. In 1966 alone, a total of 49,023 cases were filed.\r\nThere is, therefore, a real crisis in the judicial arm of our democracy. For this reason, I reiterate the request I made last year for the enactment of a bill creating 16 circuit criminal courts and another seeking to enlarge the prosecution arm of the Department of Justice. These bills, already approved by the Senate, are pending action in the House.\r\nI must also call attention to the bill seeking to transfer jurisdiction over certain cases from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeals and from the Courts of First Instance to the lower courts.\r\nWe shall continue the fight against subversion through our policy of compassion and firmness\u2014 compassion for the misguided and firmness against the subversive.\r\nThe Central Luzon Development Program shall be pressed with greater vigor to correct the conditions which breed unrest and discontent. At the same time, we shall not hesitate to use the sanction of law to suppress dissidence.\r\nRecently, however, the problem of subversion has become more difficult, due partly to past contradictory government policies and to the absence of sobriety in assessing the problem of subversion. It is unfortunate that many valid liberal causes have been denounced as Communistic by those among us of an authoritarian bent, and equally unfortunate that the essentially conspiratorial character of Philippine Communism has been taken too lightly by others. These errors have contributed, not to the solution of the problem of subversion, but to its clear and definite aggravation.\r\nTo those who seek to overthrow the government, we shall respond in the only language they know\u2014the language of firmness. But to those who are merely misguided and are sincerely working to uplift the common man, we offer the loving embrace of our people in a common effort to build a just society.\r\nBut we cannot succeed completely until we regain the confidence of the ones most directly concerned; the local officials who have been intimidated into supporting the Huk movement, the farmers who have found more justice in the Huk tribunals than in our regular courts, the many others who have remained indifferent to both the Huks and the government. It remains our duty to justify for them their faith in democracy, by proving to them that our open system can succeed, as no regimented system can, in giving them a better and more equitable life.\r\nThese are what we have accomplished in our first year of office, and what we intend to accomplish in the coming years. In summary, we have weathered the crisis of our first months: a bankrupt government, debt-ridden government corporations, distressed industries, inefficient agriculture, smuggling, lawlessness, rising prices and declining terms of trade, and widespread demoralization among citizens. The government in that year redirected its attention towards more realistic programs of development, building, on the one hand, the foundations for further growth, and reviewing and correcting, on the other hand, the errors in planning and execution which it inherited. It is not unreasonable to expect, in view of this performance during that year of transition and foundation-setting, higher rates of growth and more widespread development in 1967.\r\nAll these initiatives and energies for development define a new epic of nation-building. The epic proportions of this effort can be seen in the fact that from Malaca\u00f1ang and from this Congress to the last hamlet of our 26,000 barrios, there are a thousand difficult tasks to do each day, problems and decisions that call for much in courage and self-confidence, mental and moral blocks that stand between the vision and the reality. The government cannot attend to all these tasks; it can only provide the climate in which a self-actualizing citizenry can have the opportunity to confront them.\r\nIt is a part of maturity to recognize that we, as a nation, can attain greatness only through labor and salvation through work. We used to pride ourselves in being a generation of fighters. Today, we are called upon to become a generation of builders. Our mission is to build those foundations that will replace the bamboo supports of our agricultural economy, in the phrase of Rizal, with bases of concrete and steel on which can rest a modern civilization and a fuller life for our people. This is central to the task of development.\r\nToday, in Congress, these difficulties seem to converge upon us. They press upon us with a special urgency, for we know that time may be getting short and that we must redouble our efforts. We sense that our democratic institutions are on trial, that they may not have a second chance to prove and sustain themselves. It is history that sets an early deadline for our effort. No one\u2014not even the U.S. Seventh Fleet\u2014can insulate us from the insidious dangers lapping all the Asian shores, except our own mighty will for progress and freedom.\r\nIn the end, our salvation lies within us\u2014in the flexibility of mind and strength of purpose that we can bring to the tasks of development. We must learn to accept the harder choice over the easier, mindful that integrity is nothing but moral traction.\r\nThe year just past shows that our people have this capacity for making the harder choice\u2014which in the end is synonymous with the capacity for greatness. As for me, I choose to put my faith and trust in our people\u2019s genius to overcome. At the roots of this genius is the gift of courage. Victory seeks not the crave-hearted but the man of burning purpose and indomitable will; as with men, so with nations; as with war, so with the task of peace.\r\nToday, the great epic of national development is working itself out in terms of a thousand acts of courage and faith day after day among our countrymen, and the whole society is the theater of action. Everyone sustains this great effort with his own acts of initiative and courage, which convert latent resources into opportunities for development. The whole nation, thus, is involved; and every one is involved according to the measure of his commitment to the future of his country.\r\nThe very difficulties we face should deepen this commitment to our collective future. I leave you now to your work with the thought that, with the help of God, we will look again to ourselves, and succeed in our duties according to the measure of our labors.", "title": "The Epic of Nation-Building"},
{"delivered": "1966-01-24 07:09:55+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, on January 24, 1966]\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate and House of Representatives, excellencies, friends, my countrymen.\r\nToday, I come to Congress as a partner in a great enterprise. Congress is the \u201cseat of reason,\u201d and the Executive is the \u201cseat of the will.\u201d\r\nWe are indispensable to each other. Reason without the power of will is impotent, and will unaided by reason degenerates into brute and force. Thus, it is that you and I are bound to each other, and crisis strengthens this interdependence. And we are in crisis.\r\nAnd so I come to you not as a partyman, for it is my fervent hope that I shall always conduct myself as a President of all the people.\r\nI was met with disbelief when, during my inaugural address on December 30 last, I stated that we were in a state of crisis. It is my task today to recount the unhappy details of such a crisis. Our government has been spending more than it has been earning. The daily income of government is P4 million while its daily expenditures are P6 million. This means a daily deficit of P2 million. As of December 31, 1965, the cash position of the government was minus P228 million.\r\nDuring the preceding six months from July to December 1965, the total net borrowings amounted to P300 million. This was utilized to finance the excess of expenditures over income. As of December 31, 1965, the total budgetary loans of the government aggregated P1,018.1 million. This is broken down as follows:\r\nOut of the outstanding treasury notes amounting to P562.3 million as already indicated, P213.4 million will mature during the current fiscal year 1966; P197.9 million in FY 1967; P30 million in FY 1968; while the balance of P121.0 million will mature in FY 1970. But in addition to these maturing obligations, the provisional advances of the Central Bank granted to our government of P170.0 million will also be due on or before the end of September 1966. You can see, therefore, that our government is hard put to meet its obligations. And the financing horizon is shrouded in darkness. For the different government financial institutions are floundering.\r\nThe Philippine National Bank is holding loans to the Rice and Corn Administration, the Philippine National Railways, the NAMARCO, the National Development Corporation, and the Agricultural Credit Administration in the amount of P408 million which it may have to pay itself, if it does not transfer it to our government. The most probable alternative will be that our government will have to pay for this. The Philippine National Bank, therefore, now seeks to borrow funds for its own operations. The GSIS has overdrawn its count with the Philippine National Bank by P35 million. The Development Bank of the Philippines with a billion capitalization lost more than P5 million in operations last year, the first time since its organization. The Social Security System is badly indebted. This is the picture about our fiscal position. And let\u2019s not forget that we have just survived a ruinous electoral campaign which threatened to debauch the national treasury.\r\nElection\u2014the noble process of manifesting the mandate of the majority\u2019s will\u2014has been degraded into a contest of the rich and the unscrupulous. Apparently, only by a miracle, so the observers say, has the deserving but penurious candidate won in an election.\r\nIt is now time to rise from such a degradation. We must curtail unnecessary expenditures and limit the period for active campaigning. I therefore propose legislation limiting the expenses of any candidate to four times the annual salary for the position to which he aspires.\r\nThe total expenses of the party to which he belongs, all his contributors, and all supporting organizations should not exceed the total of one centavo per registered voter in the country or about a millions pesos.\r\nIt is suggested that perhaps it would be better if no sample ballots were distributed except as incidental to or as a part of other propaganda leaflets within the limits prescribed, but the names of all candidates of each party, and independent groups, should be posted in every election booth at election time. The use of newspapers, television, and radio should be limited to a reasonable level. The period of campaign should be limited to six months for national offices and to three months for local offices.\r\nI therefore recommend legislation which would prohibit any campaign activity such as the printing and distribution of any poster, advertisements for candidates, or activity of any candidate seeking insertion of such advertisements before such period allowed by law for campaigning.\r\nIn relation to electoral reforms, I feel that the power of the Commission on Elections should be expanded so as to clothe it with more investigative and regulatory authority. Our Supreme Court, the final arbiter of the law, has clothed the Commission on Elections with power to annul votes that appear in election returns that are patently fraudulent. I recommend legislation which would grant the Commission on Elections the additional power to issue injunctions against any candidate, under pain of cancellation of his name from the list of candidates, for violating the limitation on expenditure and the period of campaign.\r\nThe implementation of the new registration law must continue so as to prevent flying voters and other malpractices vitiating the popular will.\r\nI recommend the passage, however, of amendments to this new registration law, such amendments to include the punishment of possession by persons other than the owner of identification cards of voters.\r\nI also recommend the increase in the penalty for violation of the election law committed by public officials, especially public officers, and the legal methods to stop these violations should be made summary.\r\nIt is now propitious to study the amendments to the Constitution to synchronize elections, provide a single term of six years for a president. We must remove the infirmities of the fundamental law. And perhaps, it is now time also to prevent the deadlocks in the Senate, by providing for an increase in its membership.\r\nLet me now resume the recounting of the woeful state of our nation.\r\nThe productivity of our fields has barely inched upwards from substandard levels.\r\nOur industries face the challenge of recovery. Their growth has been stunted. Machines in our factories have sputtered to a stop, thereby leaving industrial capacity unused and hundreds of workers unemployed.\r\nOur industries have been the main propellent of our growth. Now they are suffering from being too thin in capital base, too fat in accounts receivables, too starved for credit, and too drained of profits.\r\nAt year-end 1965, the country continued to be plagued by serious port costs and inadequate communications.\r\nThe convenience of water supply facilities is afforded to less than half our population. Electric power reaches only a segment of the cities and the municipalities. Only 5% of our rice lands are irrigated. Indeed the challenge of adequacy on the basic complements of public service and physical facilities seems insurmountable; and our need for public works seems unlimited.\r\nOur school system continues to experience difficulties in accommodating the annual increment to the school population; in improving the quality of instruction at all levels; and in efficiently utilizing the output of our colleges and universities. We are faced with the irony of having to religiously invest a very high proportion of our limited resources in education and yet experiencing so much waste in high dropout rates and in the incidence of unemployment among college graduates.\r\nDespite advances in public health during the last decade, tuberculosis, intestinal and communicable diseases continue to take a heavy toll of life among our people.\r\nThere is a very disturbing upsurge in the incidence of criminality in our country. The crime clock indicates murder and homicide every hour; theft every 30 minutes; robbery every hour; sexual offense, estafa, and falsification every two hours. Speed in the investigation of complaints, prosecution of criminals, and adjudication of cases is far from satisfactory and there is backlog of more than 80,000 cases pending in our courts.\r\nThere are other crimes whose pernicious influence rests not so much on their rate of incidence, but more importantly, on their adverse effects on the national economy. I refer particularly to the problem of smuggling\u2014that cancerous evil that has wreaked havoc on our economy and weakened the moral fiber of our people.\r\nThese threats to our security are further aggravated by the state of preparedness of our military and police establishments, which is far from adequate.\r\nWe face a pervasive threat from a military power that has resorted to open aggression to attain its ends and has never accepted that general war would be disastrous.\r\nLimited but protracted warfare is very much in evidence in areas immediately adjoining our territory.\r\nThe conflicts in South Vietnam and Malaysia present security problems of the gravest concern.\r\nThese are some of the problems and realities in our national life. I state them with candor; and in the light of their graveness, we must solve them with vigor.\r\nAs against this background, the temper of the people has changed. It has turned from complacency into an aggressive demand for greatness. So let me outline the plan of action of this administration.\r\nOne of our first concerns is to strengthen the agricultural sector.\r\nSelf-sufficiency in the production of food, especially rice, must be attained in the shortest possible time. We must also improve and diversify our production of export crops so that we can develop Philippine agriculture into a reliable earner of foreign exchange.\r\nThis administration is prepared to find the means for the implementation of land reform. If necessary, we shall consider the sale of government properties not immediately needed to realize the funds for the proposed Land Bank. The Agricultural Credit Administration must be reoriented to permit a total concentration of its resources on land reform cases.\r\nCommunity development shall be pursued with greater momentum and depth to develop a new sense of values and to further strengthen our social, economic, and political base in an atmosphere of mass participation and mass involvement.\r\nThe attainment of these objectives, of course, requires the unstinted support of Congress, which I now ask. It is necessary to enact legislation to\r\nNext I come to the problem of industry. It is clear that the government must assist in the rehabilitation of ailing essential industries and promote the development of basic manufactures to balance our industrial structure.\r\nLet this message go forth to businessmen: Our faith in free enterprise demands that we accept the consequences of this bold adventure. While we in government are committed to defend the free initiatives of business which are not inconsistent with the public interest, we will not shy away from our responsibility to intervene, to sustain ailing essential industries. On the other hand, we expect infant industries to grow, sick industries to recover and begin to stand on their own feet. We believe in helping by temporary assistance, not in pampering through permanent subsidies. We act from a conviction that in business, as in any other activity, only those who know how to exercise their freedom deserve to be free.\r\nWe appeal to the businessmen of this nation to harness their best qualities towards our common goals. With the lifting of the retention scheme and the relative easing of credit policy, we invite our investors to direct their attention towards ventures that contribute to our productive capabilities.\r\nTo achieve these aims, we shall\r\nTo complement the efforts of the Executive in this area, I would like to see the enactment of an investment incentives legislation which shall\r\nThere shall be created an Investment Office which shall furnish all the information that may be required by prospective investors, foreign or domestic. Such an office should be ready to recommend openings for investment and to help to extend all facilities in both the public and the private sectors to the entrepreneurs.\r\nThe loss of our traditional American export market by 1974 with the expiration of the Laurel-Langley Agreement should be counterbalanced by the exploitation of new markets in Europe and among our Asian neighbors, the diversification of our export products, and a switch in export emphasis from unprocessed and semiprocessed raw material to intermediate manufactures and finished goods. For this purpose, we are submitting for congressional consideration the following measures:\r\nIn view of the scarcity of public funds, it shall be necessary to seek the aid of private financiers for some of these projects. Toll roads may be established by private contractors under Republic Act No. 3751, which I now recommend to be amended to make the terms less onerous on the contractor.\r\nHere are some of the projects conceived within the new Four-Year Development Plan which we are finalizing:\r\nThese projects amount to an astronomical total of P3,986 million.\r\nThese intentions, however, when translated into action are only a small contribution towards bridging the wide gap between present needs and present realities. Our inability to make a bigger contribution does not derive from any lack of will but from a lack of means. To augment the limited government resources available for these projects, we have recommended to Congress the amendment of the Reparations Law in order to allow greater utilization of reparations, goods, services, and funds for public works development.\r\nIn the event that our financial resources fall below present expectation, I shall not hesitate to call upon Congress to legislate such measures as may be necessary in order to avoid the alternative of having to fall back in our public works program.\r\nThird, the government must provide a solid physical base which can adequately support planned and sustained economic growth.\r\nWe seek to provide\r\nTo these ends, we intend to build no less than 1,500 kilometers of concrete roads and more of asphalt and gravel roads. We intend to improve 16,000 kilometers of feeder roads and close to 30,000 lineal meters of permanent bridges. We intend to develop an additional capacity for 1 million kilowatts of electric power and provide adequate water services for 3.7 million people in the provinces. We will irrigate an additional quarter of a million hectares and undertake river control projects in eight regions and 38 localities.\r\nThese objectives seem ambitious and they may take more than four years to accomplish, but this does not indicate any political ambition. They are merely clearly set for our planning.\r\nWe are committed to provide an educational system which can tap the potentials and vitality of our human resources. We shall continue to meet the constitutional mandate of providing free and universal primary education. Our best efforts shall be directed\r\nThe fifth plan is we shall extend maximum protection to the working man and we shall do so through a vigorous and effective implementation of existing labor laws, and we shall enhance the productivity of workers through training and placement services. However, I shall periodically present and recommend to Congress amendments to some of the existing labor laws.\r\nSixth, we shall strive to raise the efficiency of our public health services to a level which should meet the minimum requirements of our people.\r\nSeventh, the elevation of the standards of the administration of justice is a primary concern of this administration, as it should be for all administrations. It is essential that crime prevention and law enforcement should be complemented by the speedy and fair adjudication of cases. To this end, the performance of the judiciary, particularly at the lower courts, shall be improved by instituting reforms within the judicial machinery and by limiting appointments to judicial positions to men of known dedication, integrity, and knowledge of the law.\r\nAt this juncture, it may be well to remind the Members of Congress of the bills that failed to pass which sought to transfer jurisdiction and responsibility for certain cases from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeals and from the Court of First Instance to the lower courts. I shall propose legislation of this nature as they fall due.\r\nInvestment and production are the true answer, the final answer to our economic ills, but this true final answer requires as condition a measure of social and political stability.\r\nIt is imperative that certain measures be undertaken to enhance our national security, therefore, both externally and internally. These measures should be directed towards revitalizing our regular force, including local police forces, and accelerating the buildup of our reserve elements. The following are some of these measures:\r\nConcurrent with these efforts to revitalize our Armed Forces, I also propose to mobilize the manpower, material, and equipment resources of the Armed Forces in order that they may be able to assist in the execution of our social and economic development programs.\r\nWe believe in the principle of free enterprise. We realize that when the public sector goes into debt and competes with the private sector for credit, the scale is biased against the latter. This results in the draining of the credit flow to business, which in turn impinges upon production and thereby operates against our basic growth. Our financial policy therefore will be so designed that the public sector may not unduly tax the existing credit sources in competition with the private sector.\r\nIt will also be so designed that consumers do not suffer from the consequences of a rise in prices. Not only will we exercise the utmost responsibility in monetary and fiscal policy in order to hold the line on prices, but we are determined to undertake massive production programs in rice, fish, vegetables, and meat. We shall fight hoarding and market manipulation with every force at our disposal. We will continue to use the persuasive powers of the Presidency to prevent the spiraling of prices in key sectors and products.\r\nWe cannot lay any claim to nobility or greatness unless we can improve our tax collection system. We must show convincing proofs that we are using in the most judicious and economical manner the funds we collect in the form of taxes in order to leave no room for the justification of the popular hesitation to pay taxes which taxpayers claim will just be squandered away. We are recommending that the debt ceiling on domestic borrowing specified under R.A. No. 1000 and on external borrowing specified under R.A. No. 16 be raised to higher levels to provide for policy maneuver during the times of financial stress.\r\nWe must achieve not only a balanced budget with respect to current expenditures but, if possible, generate a surplus which we can use to finance capital expenditures for economic development. However, when it will not be possible to generate a surplus in the magnitude that will suffice to cover our requirements for economic development, we shall not be limited to the mere extent of such a surplus. For we intend to fulfill our responsibilities of providing adequate growth and maximum employment opportunities for our people.\r\nI therefore seek the cooperation of Congress in the amendment of R.A. No. 1000 and R.A. No. 16.\r\nTo guard against the indiscriminate use of the foreign borrowing authority, we propose that all borrowings will be on a project basis and only after the plans for such projects have been developed by the agencies concerned, approved by the National Economic Council and the Monetary Board. In view of the ambiguity in R.A. No. 16 and R.A. No. 1000, it is also desirable that we clarify the respective ceilings as applying to the amounts outstanding rather than to the amounts incurred under the respective borrowing authorities.\r\nThe challenges we face pose unprecedented and unremitting demands for high quality in ideas and performance of the public service. High competence in administration, integrity, responsibility, responsiveness, and stability in performance, and most important, the capacity for innovation and change, are needed to envision and attain our national goals.\r\nIn the past, governmental programs requiring innovations have most often been entrusted to newly created agencies staffed by dynamic \u201cnew blood\u201d as new to the public service as the program itself.\r\nWe must accept that the infusion of new blood is desirable and necessary rather than just a concession to political exigency. Let me state here and now that I respect the civil service system and will do all in my power to strengthen it. However, the existence of a \u201cclosed\u201d career civil service should not be made a shield for incompetence and mediocrity.\r\nThe challenge of our times demands that we mobilize the best talents available in the private sector as well as in the public service if we are to realize our aspirations as a people. To this end, I would like to see the infusion of our career staff with \u201cnew blood\u201d at all levels of the national government and the interchange of talent between government and private employment and among government agencies in order to enhance the responsiveness of our public service to the challenges we face.\r\nOur administrative machinery must be regenerated to gear it to the requirements of national growth. Graft and corruption in our government must be exposed and eliminated.\r\nWe resolve to effect reforms in governmental operations. To promote economy, simplicity, and efficiency in the conduct of public affairs of the government, we have already recommended to Congress, during its recent special session, a bill authorizing the reorganization of the executive department and entities.\r\nAt present, there is no single body responsible for the orderly growth of the shipping industry. We shall propose the creation of a Maritime Commission to consolidate the functions dispersed among several entities, concerning coastwise and overseas navigation.\r\nBeset as we are with tremendous challenges at home, we are also affected by the momentous happenings abroad.\r\nThe foreign policy of our Republic shall continue to be dictated by our national interests and the interests we share with other peoples of identical aspirations and goals. It must serve the enduring welfare of our nation by promoting its prosperity, security, and liberty. Its primary goals must be the security of our country from aggression and subversion, and its economic development through our own vigorous efforts and in close economic cooperation with other countries.\r\nWe shall be friends to all nations that either share our values or wish us no evil. We shall maintain close relations with our allies on a basis of mutual respect, equal dignity, and genuine identity of purpose.\r\nCommunism remains an ever-present danger to the security of this region. We shall stand ever alert to this menace and are determined to resist its expansion through our own strength and in cooperation with other nations.\r\nWe shall continue to give loyal support to the United Nations. We have participated in the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Association of Southeast Asia, and MAPHILINDO. It is our hope that these organizations will continue to strengthen our capability to ward off aggression and subversion, build our economy, and enrich our culture. We are prepared to consider with our allies and fellow members in what ways these organizations can more effectively serve our regional interests.\r\nWe intend to set arrangements in motion for the normalization of our relations with Malaysia without, however, prejudicing our claim to North Borneo and impairing our friendship with other countries.\r\nWe extend the hand of friendship and goodwill towards the Indonesian people. We pray that they shall emerge from their present trials strengthened in foreign intervention and domination.\r\nWe shall endeavor to strengthen our present policy of friendship with the Republic of China. We, therefore, intend to reexamine the procedures for the entry of persons of Chinese origin, and seek an early and just settlement of the long-pending problem of overstaying Chinese.\r\nRecognizing the importance of our relations with Japan, we shall seek to more stable political and economic arrangement with this country.\r\nThe Philippines has a vital stake in the survival of the Republic of Vietnam. We shall continue to assist this nation to the best of our ability. But at the same time, we shall support any reasonable move for a negotiated peace in Vietnam. It is my intention to send a fact-finding mission to South Vietnam to report to the Security Council and the leaders of our country thereafter.\r\nOur relations with the United States shall be maintained on a basis of common ideas and interests, of mutual respect and consideration. We are convinced that this great nation would want nothing better than to see our nation prosper in dignity and freedom.\r\nSince trade with the United States is essential to the national economy, we shall maintain this trade on equitable and mutually advantageous terms. At the same time, we shall seek to expand our trade with other countries under conditions consistent with our fundamental interests.\r\nThese are the problems that we face; these are the plans that I propose to utilize to meet them. This is the challenge of our responsibilities. Complete dedication, total heroism are demanded as the proper response. For our body politic is ill, perhaps paralyzed by a great disease, and we must meet this ailment vigorously.\r\nSome questions have been raised about the stem measures taken like the laying off of casuals. The truth of the matter is that there were no funds to pay for them. It would have been the easy way out on the part of the Chief Executive to have allowed their retention in government, but it is the hard role of the leader to sometimes inflict pain during the process of medication and perhaps of surgery. And this will be, I know, the heavy burden, the thankless task that the Chief Executive must perform during this period of recovery. But I accept this heavy burden; I ask you to accept it with me. I accept it for today my life seems to have run full circle.\r\nDuring the war and after the war, I participated in the recovery and rehabilitation of our people from a devastating conflict. And in these Halls of Congress, like you as legislator, I often stood up to plead for self-abnegation and sacrifice.\r\nToday, I come to you again not as a legislator but as a partner, as I said, in this great enterprise, in this enterprise for the recovery of our dignity and of our freedom, and I come with the same plea. The democratic faith is premised on the concern of our people for the individual\u2019s life, liberty, his security, and his health, but we still have very far to go to do justice to this faith. With the help of the Almighty, the bounty of our resources and the energy of our people, I am confident that we will meet the demands of our faith.\r\nWe must, for too long have we procrastinated as a people, be never daring to forsake, in the phrase of Rizal, \u201ca humble present for a brilliant future.\u201d But our people cannot wait and they ask us to act, and I hear them say there is no margin for pettiness. There are no reserves for partisan strifes. Our people look to Congress and to the Executive for effective, dedicated leadership for the attainment of greater freedom for all. I therefore call upon you and the rest of the nation join with me in a massive and unrelenting effort to translate these expectations into action and accomplishment. For our survival, and beyond it, our progress is in our hands. We cannot look to anybody else. We expect no help from any other sector. We must look to ourselves alone. Our nation can be great only according to the scale of our own labors, our self-abnegation.\r\nTherefore, I ask you, let us look to ourselves, and I pray that God grant guidance to all of us in this sacred and noble mission.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1968-01-22 07:16:07+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 22, 1968]\r\nTwo years ago, I came before you for the first time to report on the state of the nation, and I gave you a faithful picture of a nation bogged in crisis and a people gripped by fear of the future. Barely a year ago, I came again before you to report that the crisis had been surmounted and that the people had a new lease on hope and faith. Today, as I pass the halfway mark of my term of office, I am glad to report that in the year just past we have sustained the momentum of our advance; we have moved forward at an accelerated and accelerating rate.\r\nMany grave problems remain and most of our people\u2019s needs remain acute. But today, we face them with the confidence of self-made success; we have lost our fear of the future; problems have become challenges and goals to action.\r\nIn terms of history, two years is just a fleeting instant in the life of a nation. What could be done in two years, set against the centuries-old hard crust of problems\u2014the mass poverty, ignorance, and disease that make up the main heritage of a former subject people?\r\nBut we believed in our people. We believed that in two years a resolute people could do something meaningful for themselves\u2014perhaps meaningful enough to alter their destiny. We set out two years ago to accomplish some basic tasks which popular belief held to be impossible. The results of our common labors hearten us. For they show that the impossible can be attained and that in some respects, it has in fact been attained.\r\nSome of these achievements are in fact historic breakthroughs for our people in their march to a fuller life. Others are much less spectacular, but in the long run just as important. Consider the following:\r\nInvestments in 1967, according to preliminary figures of the NEC, amounted to P5.375 billion compared to P4.562 billion in 1966, showing a growth rate of 17.8%. An independent, nongovernmental source, the Economic Development Foundation, places the figure at P5.614 billion, or an increase of 23%.\r\nPaid-in capital of newly registered corporations for the period January t0 November 1967 totaled P385 million compared to P358 million in 1966 and P294 million in 1965. Increased capitalization of existing corporations amounted to P1,108 million in 1967 compared to P824 million in 1966.\r\nBetween January 1966 and September 1967, government financial institutions provided long-term financial assistance to private enterprise in the amount of P4.4 billion in loans, equity investments, and guarantees. Of this amount, about 40% went into manufacturing and about P1 billion consisted of assistance to rehabilitate industries that became distressed during the previous administration.\r\nThese are achievements not of a particular government administration but of the Filipino people as a whole. All these results, realized with no increase in material resources, tell a story about us\u2014a success story that exhilarates by its very novelty and rarity in our national experience. We are no longer what we always believed we were\u2014a nation of incompetents and failures. We have become a nation of achievers. We have begun to undergo the experience of competence which forms the basis of genuine self-confidence for men and nations.\r\nThere is a new birth of confidence in ourselves as Filipinos. This is in itself a source of great creative power. It reminds us of our distinguished heritage as the nation that pioneered the libertarian movement in Asia and founded the first democratic republic in our part of the world.\r\nThis year, we shall be called upon to initiate bold steps to support the pace of development that we have begun, to maintain the momentum of our social and economic advance, and to achieve within the next two years a meaningful degree of well-being among our people.\r\nThe experience of nations shows that the cost of development must be borne mainly by the people themselves. Increasingly, the burden of development will have to be shared by citizens in proportion to their economic means. It is in this spirit that the administration plans to propose to the Congress this year sweeping reforms in our traditional and inadequate tax structure. To act on this will require an atmosphere of courage and civic spirit and the ability to face the unpleasant today in return for the just rewards of tomorrow.\r\nIt seems to me that this will put to a test the capacity for courage and statesmanship of the distinguished Members of Congress.\r\nWe appeal to you for your support so that the means required to sustain the pace of our efforts for national development can be made available to the government.\r\nI think we can now point to a well-defined consensus as to certain priorities that will demand our undivided attention and concern in the year just beginning.\r\nA national consensus certainly stands behind the fuller implementation of the land reform, especially in Central Luzon.\r\nA massive housing program for low-income groups will be launched under a coordinated leadership with various agencies of the government taking part. An energetic thrust in the field of manpower training will be carried out to upgrade our labor skills and meet the growing needs of business and industry for technicians and skilled hands. We shall engage in a vigorous campaign for the promotion of Philippine export products to realize an increased amount of foreign exchange needed to provide the import requirements of our growing economy.\r\nWe shall concentrate great energies on the problem of peace and order. Local governments will be asked to play a more active role.\r\nWe shall press vigorously the existing efforts to assure our food self-sufficiency on a sustained basis, to meet the crisis posed by the lack of schoolhouses for our children, to conserve our natural resources, and to upgrade our human resources through adequate educational facilities.\r\nAs we look back over the last two years, we can say that, in general, we have good reasons to be pleased; and our satisfaction is heightened by the fact that, on the most important occasion so far given them to make their opinions felt, the great majority of our countrymen have shown that they agree with our estimate. Halfway through the administration, and almost halfway through its economic program, both the progress and the prospects of the country are encouraging. Many serious problems still confront us; but some of the most critical ones have been handled with a success that has surpassed even our early expectations. A good start has been made towards solving the others.\r\nThe administration addressed itself upon taking office to the three most serious requirements:\r\nA necessary condition to securing these was the solution of the peace and order problem.\r\nThese problems had to be solved to attain the basic objective of the economic program, which was to increase real income per head by about 2.5% annually. This meant that gross national product had to increase at the average of 6.1% annually over the four years of the plan: the target growth rates to increase progressively from 5.8% in the first year to 6.3% in the fourth year.\r\nIn the attainment of these targets, large amounts of both investible resources and foreign exchange were expected to be needed; and foreign exchange was thought harder to obtain. Domestic savings were expected to fall short of investment requirements by a total of P2.4 billion over the four years of the program; but the shortage of foreign exchange earnings as compared to import requirements was projected at P3.3 billion. A high priority was therefore attached to the expansion and diversification of our exports.\r\nThe end of last year was also the end of the first year and a half of the Four-Year Plan, and a partial comparison is now available of targets and accomplishments for Fiscal Year 1967. In most sectors, achievements have surpassed expectations. The target growth rates for the first year of the program were 5.0% for real national income and 5.8% for real gross national product. A rough comparison may be made with actual growth rates obtained during the last calendar year. According to preliminary estimates, these were 5.4% for real national income and 5.6% for real gross national product: the first figure well over the target, and the second just under it.\r\nThe target growth rate for agriculture was 4.0% for the four years of the plan. Over the last two years, our agricultural production index has been growing at almost 6% annually. The increase in real agricultural value added was 5.1% during the last year. Target growth rates were also exceeded in the transportation and commerce sectors and just about matched in the service sector. The manufacturing sector has responded vigorously to massive government support. I shall dwell later on the extent of this response.\r\nEspecially encouraging was the extremely high growth rate in agriculture over these two years, almost one and a half against the target rate that had seemed ambitious by the standards of the past. It is an indication that, well ahead of schedule, we have made a major breakthrough in food production. The National Economic Council has certified that we will have a substantial oversupply of rice at the end of the current crop year.\r\nWhen this administration took office in 1966, our manufacturing sector was in a state of deterioration. Many of our factories had sputtered to a stop or had substantially reduced their operations, laying off thousands of workers and leaving idle a considerable portion of our industrial capacity.\r\nRecognizing the importance of industrial development to our country\u2019s economic growth, we immediately instituted measures to relieve the manufacturing sector.\r\nThus, we harnessed all government agencies to an unrelenting drive against smuggling. Tariffs on imports were strictly administered to protect local products; antidumping measures were intensified. On the positive side, our domestic industries were encouraged to step up operations, to expand and to diversify according to the demands of the local and foreign markets. Infrastructure projects were implemented to aid industrial undertakings. Capital investments were stimulated in both domestic and foreign sectors through the issuance of an Administrative Order to guide investments, the approval of an amendment to the Corporation Law to allow broader investments in mining ventures, and the enactment of an Investment Incentives Act designed to induce the rapid growth of industries.\r\nThe most tangible results of government assistance to industry in the past year were in financing. To alleviate the crisis of manufacturing and mining enterprises, the Development Bank of the Philippines accelerated the industrial refinancing program which the administration launched in its first year. By November 1967, a total of P1,073 million had been channeled to distressed industrial enterprises under the program.\r\nIn addition, the administration geared the lending operations of DBF, GSIS, SSS, and PNB to the need to bolster the pace of industrialization. By the end of September last year, these financial institutions had extended accommodations totaling four-and-a-half billion pesos. Nearly 40% of this figure, more than P1.7 billion, was coursed to mining and manufacturing enterprises.\r\nThe beneficial effects of this financial assistance and of these measures instituted to curb smuggling and protect the local products can be readily seen in the upsurge of activity in our industrial sector. Production for the second quarter of last year, the latest available figure, exceeded the comparable 1966 level by 8.7%. Formerly distressed industries have come up with definite signs of good health, particularly the textile industry which was floundering and hence required sizable aid from the government. Other essential industries also showed significant improvement. The output of plywood rose by 14% in 1967; veneer by 38%; cement by 28%; and tire manufacturing by 20%.\r\nIn general, mining and manufacturing in 1967 made very favorable improvements over 1966, and even more from earlier years. Similarly, and significantly, electric power consumption rose by about 15% from the level in 1966.\r\nThe gratifying trends in the operations of our existing industries have carried over to the business atmosphere. Our private sector\u2014our entrepreneurs, investors, and industrialists\u2014have shown a new faith in the future of Philippine industry. Some 2,112 new corporations were registered in 1967, an increase over the figure for 1966 and exceeding the registrations in 1965 by over 40%. The subscribed capital stock of these corporations combined reached over P400 million, representing a tremendous amount of fresh capital pumped into Philippine industry. Out of these registrations, some 483 new companies with over P150 million in subscribed capital were in mining and manufacturing.\r\nAs to the actual implementation of industrial projects, we identified more than 40 major ventures in mining and manufacturing which started operations during the past two years of this administration. The essential products which these projects are now adding to our industrial strength include great volumes of refractory chromite, magnetite, tiles, cement, plywood and veneer, resins, ammonium sulfate and liquid ammonia, carbon black, synthetic fabrics, and petroleum products. A host of other large-sized plants are currently in the process of construction or expansion. Some will supplement existing production capacities, while others will introduce new product lines for the domestic market and for our export trade. The new capacities will include among others, steel products, copper ore and copper concentrates, pulp and paper, and plasticizers.\r\nWe have also reached the final stages of negotiations for the exploitation of our valuable nickel deposits in Mindanao, which offer the prospects of a huge new source of foreign exchange income for our economy from the export of nickel or ferronickel, mild steel billets, and cobalt.\r\nWe have succeeded in securing substantial financing abroad for our economic development projects. The support we helped secure for shipping has already been mentioned. Also, during the calendar year 1967, foreign funds amounting to P12.5 million were secured from the World Bank for the construction of the Bataan Thermal Plant in Limay and the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric Plant Unit 4 in IliganCity. These power projects, when completed generate 75,000 kW from the Bataan Thermal Plant and an additional 50,000 kW from the Maria Cristina Unit 4.\r\nLoan agreements with the AID were similarly approved during the year. Irrigation received a $4.7 million loan to finance the acquisition of equipment needed for irrigation construction and rehabilitation work. Also, a $2.0 million loan for undertaking feasibility studies was granted.\r\nAssistance has likewise been granted to our export crops, of which the case of abaca may be cited. The production of abaca dipped by 4.9% from 135.3 thousand metric tons in Crop Year 1966 to 128.7 thousand metric tons in Crop Year 1967. To alleviate the plight of this industry, the government extended financial help by releasing P2.5 million to the Abaca Corporation of the Philippines.\r\nPrices of abaca were also threatened when the U.S. announced its decision to dispose of its abaca stockpile. The Philippine government intervened in behalf of this industry and secured an agreement for a more orderly schedule of disposal.\r\nThe accomplishments of the first two years of the government capital program are impressive; particularly impressive when one considers that they were done within the framework of limited government financial resources. The expected new taxes failed to materialize; we relied instead on the more efficient and organized use of what was available. We cite the effective assistance of the Armed Forces in implementing the road building and schoolhouse programs; we point to the proficient, productive performance of our dredging fleet. In infrastructure, here are our achievements over the last two years.\r\nIn highways, 515 kilometers were paved with concrete and 903 kilometers with asphalt; 3,167 kilometers of feeder roads were constructed and 7,685 lineal meters of temporary badges were replaced by permanent steel and reinforced concrete structures. The complete projects include roads and bridges thousands travel every day: the Manila North and South Diversion Roads, E. de los Santos Avenue, the Sayre Highway in Mindanao, the Cagayan Valley Road, and the Nagtahan and Guadalupe bridges.\r\nIn irrigation, a total of 22 national gravity, 109 communal, and 813 pump projects were undertaken, designed to irrigate a total of 161,670 hectares of farmlands, out of which 75,092 hectares were placed under irrigation during the two-year period. Rehabilitation of the 79 existing systems provided extended water coverage to an additional 25,500 hectares.\r\nIn airports and airways, runways, taxiways, and aprons in 25 airports were either constructed or improved and a terminal building for the MactanAirport was constructed. In our effort to provide the improved communications facilities which are essential to safe air travel, we are attempting to provide an integrated nationwide airways system under a turnkey deferred payment arrangement.\r\nIn ports and harbors, 55 new berths, nine of which are for international shipping, were completed, with attendant port service facilities. The principal port projects were the completion of Piers 3 and 15 at the ManilaSouthHarbor. The first phase of marginal wharf for the proposed ManilaInternationalPort is nearing completion, while the contract portion of Pier 16 at the NorthHarbor is already complete. Other major port projects included those at the ports of Tacloban, Zamboanga, Iligan, Dumaguete, Pagadian, Batangas, Pulupandan, and Makan.\r\nOn August 1, 1966, by presidential directive, half of the Bureau of Public Works fleet of 14 dredges were transferred to the operational control of the Philippine Navy. Before the transfer, the fleet had been dredging at the rate of 317,000 cubic meters a month. This total was immediately improved to 616,000 cubic meters a month; by December, the fleet was dredging 1,500,000 cubic meters a month, almost a fivefold improvement. At the same time, the cost of dredging was cut to one-sixth of what it had previously been, from P5.00 a cubic meter to P0.70 a cubic meter.\r\nIn power, 112,000 additional kilowatt capacity of electrical energy was added and work is continuing on projects to provide 225,000 kilowatts of new hydro and thermal power. Two major hydroelectric power projects were undertaken. One of these, the Angat Project, was inaugurated last September 9; the other, Maria Cristina Unit 3 in Lanao, is almost complete. The Bataan Thermal Plant Unit I was started last August.\r\nA total of 97 provincial waterworks projects were completed, of which 37 were improvements or extensions of existing systems; 365 artesian wells were drilled and 1,422 more rehabilitated; 35 springs were developed for water supply. The Manila and Suburbs Water Supply Project continues to receive special attention, and is expected to be completed by December 1968.\r\nTwenty projects in major or regional flood control systems and 60 localized flood control projects were completed. The principal projects were projects to control rivers in Pampanga, Agno, Cotabato, Ilog-Hilabangan, Agusan, Bicol, and Manila.\r\nIn schoolbuildings, over 5,816 units of prefabricated two- and three-room steel and wooden types have been delivered to sites, of which 1,765 units of the steel type and 1,247 units of the wooden type were erected and another 1,145 units of the steel type were under construction. In addition, 1,179 schoolrooms of other various types were erected, with 135 rooms more under way. These have the capacity to house 660,000 schoolchildren over our many rural and urban areas, assuming single-session classes of 40 pupils per class.\r\nFinally, in the related field of transportation, the government was instrumental in securing significant addition to our shipping capacity, both interisland and international. With the use of German capital aid and under loans and guarantees provided by the Development Bank of the Philippines, four passenger-cargo liners and two bulk carriers were ordered by five interisland shipping companies. Also, during the year and likewise under DBF guarantee, two oil tankers with a total deadweight tonnage of 173,000 were ordered for our international shipping fleet; they have increased our capacity for overseas cargo carriage by fully one-third.\r\nThe general success of our production program has already been mentioned; the success was most striking in the sector to which the government devoted most attention, namely agriculture. For the last crop year, agricultural employment was up 10%; instead of the target increase in production of 4% annually, the actual yearly increase over the last two years has been about 6%. For the current crop year, our supply of rice including importations will be 63.6 million sacks of 56 kilos. Our consumption over the same period will be no more than 55.1 million sacks. We shall therefore exceed our requirements by about 8.5 million sacks, or over 15%. This excess, moreover, is accompanied by a handsome increase in the efficiency of production. From 30.8 sacks per hectare in Crop Year 1967, we shall rise to 32.8 sacks per hectare in Crop Year 1968, an increase of 6.5%. This welcome situation has occurred in spite of severe typhoon damage; and the prospects for the next crop year are even brighter.\r\nAt the same time, we stepped up the development of our fishing industry by restocking inland waters with 1.6 million fish seeds, by intensifying the campaign against illegal fishing, and by promoting fishpond production through the opening up of new fishpond areas and the expansion of credit for the fishing industry. Last year alone, the DBP pumped in P3,122,700 in long-term loans to the industry. As a result of these steps, we expect fish production to reach 705,300 metric tons this year, which would represent an increase of 10% over the production last year.\r\nWe have achieved the full consolidation of timber licenses into viable units of not less than 20,000 hectares each with an annual allowable cut of not less than 25,000 cubic meters. We have also set 100,000 hectares as the maximum size of each logging concession. The result of these steps is the emergence of our forests as our second major foreign exchange earner.\r\nWe have also undertaken vigorous measures to conserve our forest areas through the strict enforcement of the law against illegal cutting and through a sustained reforestation program which saw the planting last year of 139,273 hectares with 292 million tress using mainly such fast growing varieties as the Kaatoan Bangkal and the\r\n. We have required logging concessionaires to conduct systematic tree-planting, which they religiously do now since failure to comply could mean cancellation of their permits.\r\nIn this way, we have speeded up the systematic replenishment of our denuded forests and reduced the dangers which the wanton destruction of our forests areas in the past brought in its wake.\r\nThe government continues to direct most of its expenditures towards the social infrastructure, and here again there are many bright spots to report. Under this heading, we include the extension of government services to improve health, education, and welfare, as well as the improvement of the efficiency with which these and other government services are provided.\r\nThe improvement of government organization is apparent in its performance, especially in such matters as the improvement of tax and customs collections and the success of the rice program. The most conspicuous of the improvements in organization are probably the various coordinating groups, such as those for rice and corn and infrastructure; but there have been many other innovations; and the morale of government employees has been raised as well as their salaries.\r\nBy improving our administrative machinery for collections of customs revenues, we have been able to increase net customs revenues accruing to the General Funds by 44.3% from 1965 to 1967. On the other hand, imports increased by 30% only during the same period.\r\nThe improvement in the administrative machinery has also helped diminish smuggling. The textile industry increased its production of cotton fabrics and knitted fabrics by 30% and 43%, respectively, in 1967. On the other hand, specific tax revenues on cigarettes increased by 11.9% per cent in the calendar year just ended. These outstanding increases, in the industries most sensitive to smuggling, indicate the extent to which this social and economic evil has been brought under control.\r\nSome new administrative projects and practices may be mentioned. The Decentralization Act of 1967 has been approved granting further autonomous powers to local governments. The allotment share of provinces and cities has been increased from 10 to 13% and the allotment share of municipalities, from 2 to 4%. To enable provincial and city governments to undertake field agricultural extension work and rural health work, they have been empowered to retain the amounts theretofore contributed by provincial, city, and municipal governments to the national government for these purposes. Steps are now being undertaken for the establishment and operation of a security printing plant to safeguard the printing, issuance, distribution, and procurability of security printing jobs. Steps are also being taken for the early operation of the Board of Investments, which has been created to encourage domestic and foreign investments in certain areas of economic activity to accelerate the sound development of our economy.\r\nIn education and manpower development, there have been many achievements; but our needs are very great, and lack of funds has prevented us from going as far as we would have liked. Nearly half a million children were admitted to the first grade this year, as well as 150,000 out-of-school youths, making a total of 7 million students in school; this is one out of five Filipinos. Three million textbooks are being produced for the Public School Textbook Program; the vocational education curriculum has been revised to make it more responsive to economic needs; and training centers have been established for cottage industry workers and urban squatters. And while government relationship with private education will veer towards encouragement and assistance in place of regulation and control, we have reconstituted the Board of National Education to help our schools become channels of change and development.\r\nOur participation in Southeast Asian educational cooperation has attained for our country the establishment of two internationally assisted centers for regional research and graduate study in agriculture and tropical medicine.\r\nThe Land Reform Program continues to improve the livelihood of our farmers as well as their dignity; here again, however, more could profitably have been done, if the funds had been forthcoming. Among other accomplishments, about 8,000 leasehold contracts were negotiated and entered into; about 80,000 hectares of private and public lands were disposed of, with another 21,000 under expropriation or investigation; and almost half a million hectares of disposable land were maintained or improved.\r\nIn land reform areas, credit assistance to farmers rose by 250% over the previous year, with a total of P3,549,169 in loans released to 3,029 farmers working in an area of 13,762 hectares.\r\nAlso significant was the acquisition by the government of one private agricultural estate, thus finally inaugurating the land-buying activity of the Land Bank. With an area of 108,8433 hectares, the properly was purchased at a cost of P380,900, of which 10% was paid in cash and 90% in Land Bank bonds.\r\nIn this connection, a consortium of Filipino consultants has been formed for the purpose of identifying specific projects in which Land Bank bondholders may invest. The USAID has made available to the National Economic Council the sum of P600,000 to finance this activity. Initially, some Central Luzon landowners have expressed preference to invest in fishpond, beef, and dairy projects. At present, the consortium is studying the possible sites of these projects.\r\nAll these demonstrates the validity of our decision to proclaim the whole 2nd District of Pampanga a land reform area, a bold decision which, for the first time, raised the implementation of land reform to a serious level. Our experience in the 2nd District of Pampanga has proved, beyond doubt, that land reform is both necessary and feasible and that our people, both landowners and landless, area now prepared for land reform\u2019s liberating and modernizing impact.\r\nThe development of Central Luzon continued to be a prime concern of the government. During the current fiscal year, the Budget Commission has already released a total of P13,871,660 for various development activities in the area, hiking the total budgetary releases since the start of the Central Luzon operations to P60,269,734. This amount was used mainly to finance production loans, public works projects, rural health units, and community self-help activities.\r\nIn Central Luzon, the ACA extended loans amounting to P1,636,456.05 to 3,572 farmers, thus raising total ACA fund releases in the area to P25,894,933.39 for 49,059 farmers; at the same time, a total of 153,327 bags of fertilizers valued at P2,685,713.40 were issued to farmers, including 55,700 bags secured under the reparations program.\r\nSide by side with land reform, we shall open new settlements in virgin lands, preferably drawing settlers from enclaves of tenancy. This will ease up the pressure of population in crowded areas and at the same time harness manpower to more challenging and productive activities. To this end, I have ordered the Land Authority to make an inventory of land which may be transformed into settlements and so formulate systematic resettlement program patterned in part after the Malaysia land settlement project.\r\nThis will consist of large-scale land development program for the settlement of landless rural people on economically viable farms in land schemes provided with all essential public utilities and social amenities, adequate management, training and extension facilities, and suitable processing and marketing arrangement in order to raise very substantially their level of living. The aim is to develop them into progressive and knowledgeable farmers so that they can take their rightful place in the community.\r\nI have also directed the Land Authority to coordinate with the Land Bank in arranging with landowners the exchange of their present landholdings with government lands for conversion into agro-industrial estates. This will implement the land reform objective of converting landowners into entrepreneurs, of shifting capital and energy from idle lands to productive industry.\r\nThe year 1967 witnessed the expansion of health services in the rural areas, with the deployment of more physicians, nurses, midwives, and sanitary inspectors in our barrios, the establishment of more rural health units, and the procurement of P6 million worth of medicines and other supplies for our rural population.\r\nHospital services were increased and upgraded, as 17 government and private hospitals were opened and 76 hospital plans and designs were approved for immediate construction. Supplies and medicines worth P1.5 million were channeled to government hospitals for the benefit of our less fortunate countrymen.\r\nA five-year national nutrition program, designed to combat malnutrition among children of preschool age, was launched, together with the Cholera Eradication Program, the Poliomyelitis Eradication Program, and the Malaria Eradication Program with financial and technical assistance from WHO, AID, and UNICEF.\r\nLast year, a cancer center was established with the cooperation of the private sector, the first of many cancer centers to be established in various parts of the country.\r\nThe year 1967 saw the launching of vigorous programs for the strict enforcement of labor laws, the upgrading of labor and social services, and the acceleration of manpower development and utilization.\r\nDue to effective labor law enforcement, 22,770 workers in the logging and mining industries were paid P2,166,564 last year. These special enforcement projects formed the basis for the establishment of a Metallic Mining Industry Wage Board and the contemplated establishment of two other wage-fixing machineries in the logging and coconut industries. These impact projects, aside from achieving fruitful results, paved the way to the resumption towards the end of 1967 of a general enforcement campaign aimed at affording protection to the greater mass of workers. Victims of industrial accidents were recipients of P8,864,295 in compensation benefits; 2,129 workers received awards totaling P336,010 arising from various labor cases.\r\nTo cope with the needs of a developing industrial sector, a Manpower Development Council, composed of agencies whose activities have to do with human resources development directly or indirectly, has emerged to undertake the planning and implementation of an integrated manpower development program.\r\nTwo employment offices recently created are the first step towards the operation of a network of employment exchanges throughout the country. The need for such a national network of exchanges is basic. Providing not only placement services, they collect labor market data upon which depend planning efforts for the development and utilization of manpower resources.\r\nAn improved industrial relations climate was brought about significantly through the intensification of preventive mediation by the Department of Labor. This included the holding of industry-wide dialogues between labor and management in the shipping and arrastre, wood, and coconut industries.\r\nThrough the rigorous exercise of fiscal discipline, we were able to effect last year the 5% salary increase for all government employees, including public school teachers.\r\nWe shall always keep an open mind to further salary readjustments as changing conditions require and as we succeed, through economy, in making funds available.\r\nThe opportunity to participate in the benefits of investment will be extended to the average citizen. The Government Service Insurance System will soon launch a special program to lend money to employees with which to buy stocks in private corporations. In this way, we accelerate the process of economic growth and further broaden the social base.\r\nDuring the last two years, the total benefits paid by the SSS added up to P46.6 million, representing 48.4% of all benefits paid by the SSS since its establishments in 1957. These benefits included payments for premature death, permanent disability, sickness, and retirement. At the same time, the SSS released in 1967 a total of P10.4 million under its educational loan program, the purpose being to enable poor deserving students to go to school through SSS assistance. A total of P16.2 million has been loaned out to qualified SSS members since the inception of the educational loan program under the present administration in 1966.\r\nThe SSS also channeled last year a total of P10 million to the government rice self-sufficiency program in order to help increase rural credit capacity and enable the farmers to avail of new and improved techniques of rice production.\r\nDuring the last two years, the Social Security System has released a total of P130.1 million for housing\u2014P50 million in 1966 and P80.1 million in 1967. This amount represents 45.7% of the total housing loans released since the inception of the SSS housing program in 1958. This year the SSS expects to grant housing loans worth P120 million under its low-cost housing program for its low-income members. Under the low-cost housing program, the ceiling for housing loans has been brought down to P15,000 payable in 25 years. The SSS also aims to launch its own housing projects by purchasing and developing raw lands and constructing on a massive scale housing units costing not more than P15,000 each. The SSS has an ongoing scheme to grant loans to employer-members for the purpose of developing housing projects for their employees at a maximum of P15,000 per unit.\r\nOn the other hand, the GSIS is now making feasibility studies for the acquisition of landed estates where the GSIS plans to build 500 units of low-cost houses a month to be sold to low-salaried employees on easy terms. The GSIS looks forward to increasing this monthly production target so as to enable the administration to close the huge gap in its overall low-cost housing program. Also contributing to the housing program of the administration is the Development Bank of the Philippines and the PHHC. Last year, the PHHC sold 934 dwelling units worth P5,151,471.27 and 173 lots with an area of 66,083.30 square meters at P1,031,671.85.\r\nAn integrated and coordinated social welfare program is now taking shape to put an end to the sporadic and disorganized effort of the past. This program gives priority to services designed for social change and the development of productive skills. Special focus, however, will be placed on services that will advance the welfare of children, the youth, and their families. We are determined that the problem of delinquency, of the school dropout, and the beggar shall not persist in our society.\r\nThrough the Commission of National Integration, we have accelerated the integration of our cultural minorities into the mainstream of our national life. Five farm settlements are being maintained and operated, and 3,075 hectares of land have been surveyed as possible new reservations for our minorities. The commission has also allocated for settlers 282 lots, titles to which are ready for issuance. In 1967, the commission granted 1,845 scholarships in Philippine colleges and universities, as well as a number of foreign scholarships.\r\nWe have added fresh meaning to social justice by the creation of the Small Settlers Protection Committee to see to it that the poor and ignorant settlers, who have left their homes in the hope that pioneering in the far-flung hinterlands of our country could provide a better and happier future for themselves and their families, shall not be deprived of the lands they have occupied and cultivated for many years through the machinations of unscrupulous elements. The committee in its deliberation does not, on the other hand, overlook the rights of owners over their private properties, taking into consideration illegal occupation thereon by misguided settlers.\r\nThe Development Bank of the Philippines has taken concrete steps to establish a Greater Manila Terminal Food Market, which shall form the base of an overall program for the establishment of similar markets in other populated centers of the country.\r\nIn this connection, field surveys have been undertaken, covering 17 provinces for selected food crops, 13 provinces for livestock movements, 10 provinces for commercial poultry farms, and 8 principal Greater Manila markets for the marketing system. At the same time, topographical survey of an appropriate site in the FortBonifacio reservation is in process.\r\nThe market, when completed, will provide fanners and producers from 20 provinces with a convenient outlet for their produce, create adequate storage facilities, and reduce distribution costs. Retail markets and stores and large-scale consumers in the Greater Manila Area will have, on the other hand, adequate and regular supply of foodstuff, thereby reducing and stabilizing prices.\r\nWhen I assumed office in 1966, smuggling, criminality and other forms of lawlessness were rampant, sapping our national will and capacity to progress.\r\nWe have instituted vigorous measures to combat this threat. The PC strength has been augmented to intensify the campaign against criminality and against dissidents. This intensification is reflected in the increasing number of combat operations. The fact remains, however, that our police strength per 10,000 population, national as well as local, is one of the lowest in the world.\r\nHand in hand with increasing the strength of our national police, the PC has been revitalized and revamped for more efficient prosecution of the peace and order campaign. The METROCOM was recently activated and is now effectively assisting the Manila Police Department in maintaining peace and order in Manila. In view of its success, METROCOM-type units are now being organized in other urban centers of the Philippines. Recently, I mobilized the entire Armed Forces to augment the still limited resources for the peace and order campaign.\r\nA vital piece of legislation, the Police Act of 1966, was enacted to carry out badly needed administrative reforms in our local police forces. The full implementation of this law will go far towards upgrading the efficiency and quality of these police forces.\r\nTo harness civilian participation and cooperation in the anticrime drive, peace and order councils have been organized on the national and local levels.\r\nDespite all these measures, the incidence of crime index (major crimes per 100,000 population) continues to show an upward trend. Peace and order, therefore, remains a serious problem which will require our increasing attention in the years to come. One reason for this is the uncertain and diffused location of responsibility for maintaining peace and order on the local level. At the proper time, I will propose the placing of local police forces directly under the Police Commission, and thereby liberate police forces from politics. Their immediate improvement is one of our major aims this year.\r\nThe campaign against dissidents was intensified in 1967, resulting in the death or capture of 24 Huks in battle, including four top commanders. The military operations against dissidents, however, although prosecuted with greater vigor, was matched by an increase in civic action work in Central Luzon.\r\nSmuggling activities decreased considerably in the past year, as indicated by the volume of goods confiscated and the number of persons apprehended in the relentless antismuggling campaign. Although the forces engaged in antismuggling drive have multiplied, only P3.5 million worth of goods were seized in 1967, compared to P8.5 million worth in 1965 when smuggling was at its peak. Similarly, 900 persons were apprehended, compared to 3,000 in 1965.\r\nWe have carried on a determined campaign to stamp out graft and corruption, especially in the most sensitive areas of government. Last year, in the course of this campaign:\r\nThe success of our relentless drive against grafting officials and employees is reflected, we believe, in the increase in our customs and internal revenue collections as well as in the increased efficiency and new vitality of our lower courts.\r\nThe administration of justice, as well as the machinery therefore, has been substantially improved. The sensational cases that have appeared in the front pages of our newspaper have been brought before our courts of justice and dealt with in record time. The preliminary investigation of criminal cases has been shortened, simplified, and made uniform with the promulgation by the Department of Justice of Circular No. 74, series of 1967. Two administration measures were enacted, one enlarging the prosecution staff of the Department of Justice and the other creating 16 circuit criminal courts. Incompetent judges and erring court employees are being dealt with administratively to complete the effort towards improvement of the administration of justice.\r\nThe stand taken by the administration on various legal controversies has been sustained by our courts of justice thus underscoring this administration.\r\nThe proliferation of statutes in different areas of legislation has become alarming, indicating the urgent need for codification of laws. I have therefore directed the Code Commission to initiate immediately the revision and updating of existing codes as well as the preparation of new ones.\r\nIn line for updating and revision are the Revised Penal Code, the Code of Commerce, the Revised Administrative Code, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Customs and Tariff Code. On the other hand, there is now a demand to codify our labor and social legislation, and the laws on natural resources.\r\nThe Presidential Arm on Community Development has cooperated with religious and student volunteer groups, and has initiated some 43,000 self-help projects and 23,000 training and information activities involving 953,000 participants. Some of these self-help projects are spring development for communal water supply and irrigation; rural electrification; the establishment of communal rice and corn mills; the distribution of IR-8 seeds; as well as the construction of feeder roads and the assembly on-site of prefabricated schoolhouses.\r\nThe corporations under the Office of Economic Coordination realized profits amounting to P53.3 million for Fiscal Year 1967, representing an increase of 29% over the previous year. To further improve the profitability of these corporations, allowances of board members and per diems for committee meetings have been standardized. In their role as developers of new industries, all investments are now required to be tunneled strictly to pioneering or pacesetting ventures.\r\nRecognizing technology to be the foremost factor in economic development today, as strikingly demonstrated in the economic recovery of Japan and Germany after World War II, the government has embarked on a new program to invigorate the scientific climate of the country. Additional funds have already been channeled to support new projects in the field of applied science. About P2 million have been allocated to augment the facilities and admit a larger enrollment in the Philippine Science High School. Thirty-five hectares of public land have been proclaimed by the Office of the President as a grant to the National Science Development Board to accommodate the science community.\r\nIn support of new projects in the field of industrial research, more than P6 million yearly have been allotted by the government for the Philippine Textile Institute, the MetalsIndustryDevelopmentCenter, and Coconut Research.\r\nThe government has also been active in tapping foreign assistance for the support of research in applied science. In the field of mineral resources development, the government has undertaken jointly with international agencies special projects in coal development and applied geology. More than P8 million yearly in counterpart funds are being expended by the government for foreign assisted research in dairy, fish, soil and training in agriculture, forestry, and meteorology.\r\nThe government is also supporting, through bilateral foreign assistance agreements, an Institute of Small Scale Industries and a Technological and ResearchCenter for Cottage Industries. The administration is drafting a plan providing for increased financial support for science and technological development, including the possibility of establishing regional science high schools in the Visayas and Mindanao.\r\nRecognizing the need to develop talent and provide it with greater opportunities, I have created a committee to formulate a new scholarship program. I am determined that poverty or lack of opportunity shall not prevent real talent from developing to its fullest possibilities. The committee on this new program of scholarships is now studying ways of financing the program and laying down the criteria for the grant of scholarships. I expect its recommendations shortly.\r\nAt the same time, we shall soon put into effect a scheme for the benefit of students, building on an existing service of the Social Security System whereby students may be provided loans, under special terms and conditions, to cover their school expenses. This will be financed from a special fund contributed by various financial institutions of the government.\r\nThe progress we are striving for goes beyond the mere requirements of survival. Our economy must prosper if our society is to be truly secure. I have repeatedly said that the greatest peril to a people, to the safety of their lives and institutions, is their own country\u2019s improvident economy,\r\nFor the task providing our society with sufficient guarantees of stability and security, in the form of more abundant goods and a greater sense of well-being, I have enlisted the services of the Armed Forces. Although it is proper that our soldiers must be prepared to perform their role in the military defense of the country, it is necessary that today they must also participate in the more immediate and vital defense of the nation against poverty, ignorance, disease, and injustice.\r\nAccordingly, the Department of National Defense has participated actively in the rice production, school building, public works, rural health, peace and order, and civic action programs.\r\nWe have harnessed and augmented the manpower and equipment resources of military establishment in our heightened drive for economic development and for internal security.\r\nIn pursuance of this, we have activated 15 engineer construction battalions, increased the intake and expanded the concept of training of 20-year-olds, intensified the AFP\u2019s civic action role, broadened its peace and order operations, and increased its capability not only to provide for national security but also for participation in national development implementation. The AFP has achieved outstanding success in this.\r\nMore specifically, we acquired equipment under the U.S. Military Assistance Program to complete the requirements for five engineering battalions; activated 27 civic action centers; trained a total of 119,082 reservists and trainess, including 118,082 ROTC cadets, for various economically useful skills in Calendar Year 1967 alone; acquired modern aircraft and vessels and other military hardware to bolster our defense capability; effectively blunted smuggling operations; and organized the METROCOM and other PC units to intensify the peace and order campaign.\r\nWe also sent the PHILCAG to South Vietnam to participate not in combat operation but in purely civic action operations, assisting that distressed country in the long range but equally important task of social and economic rehabilitation.\r\nIn the meantime, we have been intensifying our efforts to meet the insurgency threat. However, the threat remains real and has assumed greater urgency. This is reflected by the increasing number of combat operations and the increasing number of casualties sustained both by our troops and by the dissidents. On the credit side, a substantial number of HMBs including four top commanders have been killed or captured.\r\nDespite the continuing insurgency threat and the increasing number of civic action mission assigned to the Armed Forces, its proportional share of our total national budget has actually declined over the past 13 years. Budgetary data show that this has gradually decreased from 17.5% in FY 1965 to 14.6% on FY 1967.\r\nAs I slated upon arrival from my recently concluded three-nation state visits, I am now convinced that the primary threat to our national security within the immediate future comes from internal subversion rather than from any external aggression. The military establishments will be developed along this basic premise in the years to come. However, since the development of our economy provides the permanent solution to this threat, I intend to harness to a greater extent the resources of our defense establishments in our task of nation-building. It would be culpable negligence on our part if the peaceful uses of military forces were not availed of to the fullest extent possible in our continuing program of economic development.\r\nIn this regard, we will activate five additional engineering battalions and establish 38 new civic action centers so that each province will have one such center. We will create 100 military rural health teams to minister to remote and medically depressed areas where civilian doctors are reluctant to venture for reason of personal security or inadequacy of compensation. We will also establish 13 Coast Guard stations to strengthen our antismuggling posture, and continue to acquire more modern weaponry for our ground, sea, and air units. I wish to point out in this connection that additional equipment for five complete engineering battalions, procured through the U.S. Military Assistance Program, will arrive before the end of this Fiscal Year 1968.\r\nIn the field of civic action, we have generated tremendous enthusiasm in our people, particularly in the rural areas, and we feel that the challenge of civic action today is now to meet the growing expectation and yearning of our people. Towards this end, we will reorient our civic action programs from impact-oriented to development-oriented ones.\r\nIt is also our purpose to exploit fully the capabilities of the AFP for manpower development and training, tying this in with the annual call of 20-year-old trainees. More 20-year-olds will be called and given training not only in the basic military arts but more importantly in agricultural, construction, and other technical skills. They will be drawn from and trained in their respective localities and their nonmilitary training will emphasize those skills that are responsive to the manpower needs of the particular locality.\r\nAs a further extension of this scheme, quasi-governmental companies composed of retired officers with managerial competence will be organized and encouraged to develop economically viable agricultural or industrial projects in these localities, procuring their workers from among the 20-years-olds who have completed the training. Thus, aside from meeting the demand for skilled labor, the program will assure the continued utilization of valuable managerial and technical skills at no extra governmental cost because the retired officers are already receiving their retirement pensions. In case these companies can generate enough income to pay higher salaries in lieu of these pensions, this will further relieve the government\u2019s ever-increasing financial burden of paying for such pensions.\r\nWe are also studying a phasing-out program, over a 10-year period, of the military units and installations located in the Metropolitan Manila area. For national security and economic purposes, these military installations should be moved out of population and industrial centers and transferred to more militarily secure and underdeveloped areas. The valuable real estate presently occupied by the Armed Forces can then be sold to provide the much needed funds for economic development, such as financing the operations of the Land Bank or funding the vital infrastructure projects.\r\nI consider peace and order a continuing major problem. This is, however, concentrated in the Metropolitan Manila area where about two-thirds of the reported index crimes for the entire country are committed and over which the PC incidentally has no jurisdiction. An increasing number of piratical raids in ManilaBay and the Visayas-Mindanao area has also been noted. I have been informed that these raids are abetted by the encouragement and support of certain affluent sectors in these areas. Our antipiracy efforts have resulted in the breaking up of the notorious pirate gang operating in the Cebu area, and our employment of the PC has enhanced our anticrime drive. Nevertheless, the solution to the peace and order problem requires nothing less than the complete mobilization of government resources and the utmost participation and cooperation of the citizenry.\r\nWe have prepared the groundwork for a peace and order program that will call for the total involvement of all government entities hand in hand with civic organizations and the general public. We will make maximum use of the Armed Forces in this all-out integrated peace and order campaign.\r\nCertainly, we shall continue to maintain the PHILCAG in South Vietnam as an international commitment. Valuable as the PHILCAG\u2019s civic action operations are now in the country, they will be increasingly valuable in helping provide the means for South Vietnam\u2019s economic and social recovery once the fighting is over.\r\nIt is not correct to say that the military is usurping or taking over civilian functions. There is neither usurpation nor duplication of efforts. The military merely supplements civilian performance, especially in areas where civilians, in and out of the government service, are either unwilling or unable to operate effectively. For instance, we are sending a naval medical corps to practice in Lanao and Sulu in order to augment the extremely inadequate civilian medical service available in those remote areas.\r\nWhat we have done is to refashion the role of the military towards civic action\u2014the reassignment of soldiers from housekeeping in the barracks to active participation in the epic of development.\r\nThe concern for an accelerated and expanded program of economic development, using all possible means and resources, led me to explore recently with the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand possibilities of closer cooperation in economic development. My state visits to these three countries have increased my confidence that national development and regional development can and must go hand in hand. We and our neighbors, in a region where the opportunities for growth have been largely unfulfilled, must now bring our skills and resources together to establish the only real basis for peace and security.\r\nThe community of interests in our immediate neighborhood, reaffirmed during my recent state visits, is in line with one of the fundamental aims of our foreign policy, which is to achieve economic development through close cooperation with other countries.\r\nThus, as a consequence of the specific agreements with the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand to undertake with the Philippines joint economic, cultural, and educational projects, we can look forward to more speedy economic development on a national as well as on a regional scale.\r\nOnly recently, we helped build the framework for progress through cooperation by joining, as one of five founding members, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The ASEAN as an instrument for economic advancement figured prominently in my discussions with the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The promise of success that the ASEAN holds has confirmed the validity of the increased emphasis in our foreign policy on our relations with the rest of Asia.\r\nOur Asian identity has been further strengthened by our participation in the Asian Pacific Council. Concrete projects under the ASPAC, such as the Experts Services Register in Canberra, the Social and Cultural Centre in Seoul, and the Food and Fertilizer Bank, all designed to accelerate regional economic and material growth, are now in the final stages of implementation.\r\nIt was primarily the need to strengthen this ever-widening fabric of regional cooperation as a means to prosperity and peace in Asia that moved me in 1967 to undertake, personally, missions to several nations in our region.\r\nI journeyed to Australia, following the tragic death of Prime Minister Holt late last year, to convey the sympathy of the Filipino people to that great country, with which we are allied in SEATO and ASPAC.\r\nMy visit to the Republic of Vietnam about the middle of last year enabled me to witness the humanitarian efforts and constructive building projects of our officers and men in the PHILCAG. That visit also gave me the opportunity to assess with the leaders of South Vietnam the chances of restoring peace, a requisite of enduring progress in our part of the world.\r\nI am determined that the momentum for Asian prosperity and stability, which we gained through our recently renewed contact with Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, shall be maintained\u2014if possible, increased. For the second fundamental aim of our foreign policy, which is to ensure the security of the Philippines from aggression and subversion, is inextricably linked with our economic development. A better life for our people is the best guarantee of their security.\r\nPresent regional security arrangements should be recast to conform to a vital change in outlook. The real danger to our democratic life and institutions comes from internal subversion rather than external aggression. This danger grows and solidifies in direct proportion to the discontent among the people. It should be the primary concern of every government, therefore, to provide for the comfort and well-being of its citizens. On a regional scale, governments must find every possible means to align their efforts towards cooperation in economic development. The SEATO must now shift its emphasis from military preparedness to economic assistance among its members.\r\nIn recognition of the increased investment requirements of business, our monetary authorities began the last calendar year by continuing the policy of credit ease which had been adopted during the previous year. The result, however, for the first half of the year was a credit expansion more than 10 times the amount over the comparable period in 1966. Also, much of this credit went to finance imports, which increased by 45% in the first six months as compared to the first half of 1966, while exports lagged behind. The result was the June circulars of the Central Bank, which were designed to curtail imports and redirect bank credit to other activities, especially production for export and food requirements; these circulars were later modified in October.\r\nThe measures that were contained in the June circulars and the subsequent October circulars contained a mixed policy of partial restriction and partial relaxation. The burden of the restrictive measures fell on imports financing because of the disturbing trend of our external trade.\r\nAt the same time, to ensure the continued nourishment of the more desirable roots of economic growth, credit continued to be more liberal for the producers of rice and corn as production was exempted from the rediscount ceiling; and half of the ceiling was earmarked for the financing of export production. If some banks then still feel that their liquidity has been reduced, it is perhaps a sign that their loan portfolio is unbalanced, favoring activities which, in the opinion of the government, are less conducive to economic development. The increased activity in our stock market shows that there is certainly considerable capital available.\r\nA second purpose of these credit restrictions was to contain the increase in prices; but the ultimate solution to high prices, as our recent experience clearly demonstrates, is to improve production and distribution facilities, especially of food products. The early success of our rice program was reflected in a decline of the Philippine Consumer Price Index in the months of April and May 1967 from its level in December 1966. Then two typhoons occurred which damaged the rice crop and blocked roads leading from production to market centers, and prices promptly rose again. The movement of vegetable prices was an even more striking demonstration. In April of last year, vegetables prices were 27% below their December 1966 level. Then the storms came, and prices rose by more than half of their year-end level.\r\nOver the last fiscal year, domestic savings exceeded the expectations of our economic program; unfortunately, investment requirements also exceeded expectations by a similar amount. The domestic savings shortfall was financed almost entirely by reparations and grants, with reserves and a small capital inflow making up the remainder.\r\nThe government during this period significantly influenced the size and direction of private investment, as well as the conditions under which business was done. Domestic markets were protected against dumping by proceedings against undervalued synthetics and chemicals, and against actual and technical smuggling particularly in textiles and luxury items.\r\nMassive support was also granted to the private sector by government financial institutions. Between January 1966 and November 1967, as has been mentioned, no less than P4.4 billion were extended by the five major government financial institutions to private concerns in the form of loans, guarantees, and equity investment. These institutions were the DBF, PNB, GSIS, SSS, and NIDC. Of this total, P1.7 billion, or 40%, went to manufacturing, and over P786 million to agriculture, forestry, and fishing.\r\nThe year just passed also saw a number of innovations in the management of government finances, again generally with striking success. The improvement of our tax collecting organization is now a matter of public knowledge and pride, and I shall only note here that it continues unabated. Total BIR and Customs collections for 1967 (January to October) were about 20% over 1966, which in turn had been 10% over 1965. Internal revenue collections were up by over 13% and Customs collections (when volume of imports increased by 14%) were up by almost 32%. Both of these had also increased over 1965, by 5.7 and 16%, respectively. Since no new tax measures were passed, and since the economy did not grow by nearly the same amount, most of this increase may be attributed to greater efficiency in both these important government arms.\r\nThe management of government debt was also undertaken with imagination, efficiency, and success. The market for government securities for the first time in our financial history became truly widened, with treasury bills becoming available to the private commercial sector at competitive interest rates. We have realized as much as P175 million from this source, with the balance now standing at about P130 million. The progress bonds of the Development Bank of the Philippines have been an outstanding success and have tapped private savings to the extent of P200 million as of the beginning of this month.\r\nFinally, last year also saw the passage of the most sophisticated and potentially the most significant piece of economic legislation in the last 20 years. This is, of course, Republic Act 5186\u2014the Investment Incentives Act. It sets forth in one legislation the investment policy of the government; but it goes beyond other incentives legislation in more than just comprehensiveness. It recognizes that economic conditions are constantly changing, and defines desirable areas of investment with corresponding flexibility. Most important, it creates in the Board of Investments a permanent machinery for planning investment in productive sectors, whose objectives are both to increase the amount of investment in the aggregate and to rationalize its structure.\r\nIn short, we have used with imagination and skill the resources we have for increasing the rate and improving the structure of capital formation, and we have added significantly to these resources. But both our recent success and the pressing needs of the people inspire us to further ambition.\r\nThe search for economic prosperity demands that we straighten out the state of our financial affairs. Fiscal irresponsibility breeds conditions that are not conducive to monetary stability. When we sow the seeds of currency and price instability, we ultimately lose the benefits of economic progress.\r\nOur budgetary policy, therefore, ever since I assumed the Presidency, is to maintain a balanced budget insofar as the ordinary operating expenses of the government are concerned. Funds raised through the issues of bonds and other forms of borrowings have been applied to infrastructure, development expenditures, and investments.\r\nIn the allocation of funds, more emphasis has been given to economic development and less on general government. Two years ago, the budget for economic development amounted to only 25.0% of total expenditures. We have increased this to 30.8%.\r\nOn the other hand, the budget for general government has been decreasing percentage-wise. It was 14.4% of the total budget in Fiscal Year 1966. During the current fiscal year, it amounts to only 11.5%. Moreover, contrary to the common impression, the budget for national defense has not grown in proportion to the total annual budget. In spite of the increased responsibilities of our Armed Forces, due to its dual military duties and civic action activities, its expenditures even decreased from 14.5% in Fiscal Year 1966 to an estimated 14.2% for the current fiscal period.\r\nCapital expenditures also increased from 9.3% in Fiscal Year 1966 to 17.5% in Fiscal Year 1967, while current operating expenditures decreased from 90.7% to 82.5% for the same fiscal year.\r\nWe began this message by defining three major economic problems of long standing. After two years of the present administration, we can say with reasonable confidence that the first of these, the problem of producing enough food for our needs, is no longer of primary concern. This does not imply a diminution of our efforts to aid agriculture\u2014two-thirds of our people still live in rural areas and we have a long way to go before we can be satisfied that their way of living has improved sufficiently.\r\nOf the problems that still confront us, the most serious one, and one that is important to national self-respect as well as economic life, is the problem of improving our foreign exchange earnings. With our rapid growing population and in our present stage of industrialization, our country must trade in order to live acceptably well. The limits of easy import substitution have been reached, and substantial overcapacities already exist in many industry lines. At the same time, the country\u2019s list of exports has not changed markedly over the last 20 years, and remains composed primarily of agricultural products and industrial raw materials, for which the world market grows too slowly. Furthermore, our preferential trade relations with the United States are due to expire in a few years.\r\nFirst priority must therefore be given to increasing our exports and to sustaining this increase over the long term. Our ultimate goal is self-sustaining growth, i.e., a high growth rate which can be maintained without undue reliance on foreign borrowing. Domestic savings are rising fast enough to be sufficient for our investment requirements in about 10 years; but exports continue to fall short of our import requirements. We must eventually aim at an annual growth rate of 8% for our exports, and efforts to attain this goal must begin immediately.\r\nThis is a problem of the greatest importance; it affects every aspect of our economic life; and the pressure to increase export earnings will continue as far ahead as we can foresee.\r\nThe export drive must begin immediately, and continue far into the future. Later on, I shall outline the measures I believe necessary to undertake immediately.\r\nThe second major problem that remains is financing our infrastructure program. The government has committed itself to providing many services which are essential to welfare or even to life. Half a million children annually enter our school system; health services must be expanded; training programs are urgently needed to reduce unemployment; the HMB continue to be a threat to our national security in spite of recent success in the field. Our support of these and other essential services are current, not capital expenditures; they already absorb the bulk of government earnings, and annually become more expensive to provide. Still, a large and growing surplus must be obtained for capital expenditures; and not even the greatly increased efficiency in collecting existing taxes can do this.\r\nMeasured against the achievements of previous administrations, the performance of the last two years is impressive; measured against the people\u2019s needs, they remain modest. The confidence we have gained from past success, as well as our consciousness of the needs which remain great, inspire us to set even higher goals for the future.\r\nThese longer-term goals are set forth in the rolling programs of our planning and implementing agencies. We shall merely outline here what has to be done over the next year. Our operational program involves activities in four areas: continuing government reorganization for efficiency; projects to be directly undertaken by the government, especially in infrastructure; manpower development and land reform; the improvement of our foreign trade; and the direction of domestic and foreign investment.\r\nIn public administration, the most pressing need is for legislative action of the Reorganization Bill and the Revised Administrative Code, already submitted to Congress. We need to transform our administrative structure into the dynamic and synchronized machinery needed to perform effectively its role in economic development. In support of this, we also have to recast our long-established but now outmoded processes and procedures. We therefore propose to continue the reassessment of the organization and operations of our administrative machinery.\r\nIn infrastructure, our basic objective remains the provision of a structurally safe and sufficient network of major thoroughfares, with supplementary integrable developmental road systems, complementary water and air transport facilities, and a comprehensive communications network\u2014together with the irrigation and other facilities necessary to support economic growth.\r\nOur basic criterion in the selection of our infrastructure projects has been their contribution to economic growth; but our selection has been realistic as well. We have also considered the financial resources available to the government and what we hope to obtain from new taxes, as well as the capabilities of the agencies to utilize capital funds.\r\nIn highways, we propose the concrete and asphalt paving of a total of 1,000 kilometers, the construction of 2,000 kilometers of developmental and feeder roads, and 9,900 lineal meters of permanent bridges.\r\nWe have started the groundwork for the construction of the 3,000-kilometer Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway which, running from LaoagCity in the north to ZamboangaCity in the south, will link Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. This highway will serve two purposes: It will also contain emergency airstrips, to augment existing airports, to make possible aircraft landings along the whole stretch of this cross-country highway at regular intervals.\r\nWe have also taken initial steps for the conduct of a Nationwide Transport Survey which we hope to get off the ground this year. The purpose of the survey is to provide a comprehensive and coordinated transport program on the basis of the expected socioeconomic development of the country and its various regions, suggesting measures to be taken in the field of planning and regulating transport services, in the field of the responsibilities and organization of the public and semipublic entities involved, and identifying investments in the entire sector and priorities there.\r\nWe propose the irrigation of an additional 140,000 hectares to comprise our main irrigation program. In addition, we will continue the construction of communal and pump irrigation projects which will extend irrigation benefits to some 50,000 hectares more. We are pursuing the construction of the multimillion-peso Upper Pampanga River Project which is designed primarily for irrigating 81,000 hectares in and providing domestic water supply to Nueva Ecija.\r\nIn airports and airways, we propose the concrete paving of runways and taxiways in 20 airports. We will improve and modernize the air navigation facilities throughout the country urgently needed for the safety of life and property in air travel. We also expect to complete runway resurfacing of the ManilaInternationalAirport by April this year.\r\nVarious projects at the Port of Manila will be completed, and provision has also been made for the improvement of 31 other ports throughout the country.\r\nThe most conspicuous of the communications projects is the permanent Earth station of the Philippine Satellite Communications Project to be completed in April of this year. An interim Earth station for this project was completed in a record time of 45 days and made operational in April of last year.\r\nOther targets include 14,000 school units, 9 hood control projects costing some P13.6 million, low-cost housing, 40 waterworks projects, and various community projects.\r\nTo achieve these targets, we will need P580 million this year. This, however, does not include the whole cost of special projects like the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway.\r\nThese facilities, by making it possible to increase production and income, will contribute indirectly to augmenting the livelihood and dignity of our people. But the government must also continue to make a more direct contribution. In addition to the services we normally provide, such as education and health services, we propose to concentrate on two programs, land reform and manpower development.\r\nIn land reform, we shall concentrate our efforts on the second land reform district of Pampanga to make the program more effective. Also, sources of funds were authorized last year for the Land Bank; we shall encourage this year the utilization of these sources to make the operations of the Land Bank more effective. New funds will be drawn by the bank from the issue of bonds up to P10 million, which I authorized last year; and from the proceeds of the sale of 16 government properties in Manila authorized by Republic Act 5169. The sale is expected to realize up to P120 million, of which three-quarters is to go to Land Bank and the remainder to the Agricultural Credit Administration.\r\nTo complement our land reform efforts, we are opening up the 33,000-hectare Barira Farm in Parang, Cotabato, for Army veterans, former dissidents, and landless tenants. Later this year, we shall also open 30,000 hectares in Tuao, Lanao del Norte.\r\nUnemployment continues to be a pressing problem, with about 8% of our labor force totally unemployed last year. We are considering several proposals to improve the skills of our idle manpower and thus make them productive members of society.\r\nAmong these measures are an in-plant skills training program responsive to current and projected needs of industry; and training for employment of out-of-school youth and unemployed adults through a network of practical training centers and free vocational instruction at the secondary school level. These proposals shall be embodied in an omnibus manpower development and training bill which I shall shortly submit to Congress for consideration and enactment.\r\nWe are laying the groundwork for a national youth development program. Eventually, it will redeem some 3 million of out-of-school youth, teach them civics, physical fitness, occupational and food production techniques. It involves the establishment of a national institute for youth leadership, pilot training centers, and the cooperation of the Manpower Development Council, the National Youth Coordinating Council, the Departments of Education, Labor, National Defense, the PACD, and the private sector.\r\nFinally, in the area of housing, we shall aim at increasing the credit resources available for low-cost housing as well as orienting lending practices towards the needs of low-cost homes. Likewise, support shall be given government housing agencies to make them effective instruments for low-cost housing.\r\nOur Social Security System, for example, has finalized its plans for building 7,000 low-cost houses annually. This project is scheduled to start this year.\r\nPartly because of the growing needs of the people, partly because of their neglect in the past, the government is forced to spend this year and the next very large amounts for the provision of services essential for public welfare and facilities essential for economic development. To promise such things is popular; but we must not shirk the less attractive discussion of how they are to be financed.\r\nIn the drafting of this program, every possible reduction has already been made. The proposals have been subjected to ruthless scrutiny and pruning; only those that have met the strictest criteria of economy, efficiency, and necessity have been allowed to pass, and these often in severely reduced form.\r\nAs evidence of this testing, I have laid down, in a proposal unprecedented in the history of Philippine budgeting, an absolute upper limit on the level of current expenditures. For this fiscal year, current expenditures from the general fund will not be allowed to exceed P2 billion. This limit will hold absolutely, in spite of the fact that the cost of providing the services that these expenditures represent has risen considerably.\r\nEvery other centavo that the government can raise will go into our capital program. But this money must not only be spent wisely; it must also be raised wisely.\r\nThere remain four alternatives open to us, and we have already utilized as much as is possible or prudent, those alternatives that are open to purely executive action. First, we can borrow from abroad. We have already secured extensive foreign financing for capital projects; what keeps us from borrowing more is that we cannot raise the necessary local counterpart funds. Second, we can borrow domestically, and we have in fact programmed sizeable bond issues for both this year and the next. But fiscal prudence sets a limit to this sort of financing, to which we are already disturbingly close. The two remaining alternatives must also be used.\r\nWe propose a two-pronged attack on the problem of raising government revenues. The first line of attack is to continue as we have done, and I think done conspicuously well, to improve the efficiency of collecting existing taxes. But this has not proven sufficient; many important programs have had to be curtailed for lack of funds. All that is humanly possible to increase the efficiency of the tax collecting agencies have been done and will be done. But this is not enough. A second line of attack is therefore necessary, has been necessary, for many years, and is especially urgent at this time precisely because it has been so long delayed. This is the passage of several new revenue measures, most of them long-standing proposals, other more recent, all badly needed. They have been the recommendations of recognized authorities on fiscal and monetary matters including former Central Bank Governors Miguel Cuademo and Andres Castillo and present Governor Alfonso Calalang. Likewise, they have been the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. The alternative to their nonpassage would be continued pressures on our international reserves, which would compel us to further restrict credit and/or cut back on our development program. Failure to pass them could lead to unmanageable price increases for which you and I must bear the responsibility. While a moderate increase in prices is admittedly compatible and concomitant with economic growth, a runaway inflation, which we seek to avert with new taxes, would certainly not be conducive to growth and disruptive of it. How badly we need new taxes can be seen from the following example. We wish to raise P580 million for our capital program this fiscal year. Foreign financing has already been netted out of this figure. Existing taxes, even allowing for continuation of the increase in efficiency of collection, after deducting current expenditures and programmed bond issues, will lead us some P250 million short of this goal. A rather large amount remains, opposite the hopeful notation, \u201cto be financed from other sources.\u201d\r\nThis enormous disparity between government needs and government means has existed too long; and the makeshifts and compromises that have been employed to bridge the gap have at last become insupportable. The reform of our tax system is long overdue. We ask that it be undertaken immediately.\r\nThe justifications are compelling. We can certainly afford more taxes: The proportion of national income our government disposes of is about half the comparable percentage for Malaysia and about 50% less than that of Thailand, neither of which countries is conspicuously richer than we are. Furthermore, our present tax structure was essentially created before 1939, when our needs were much simpler, and when we had a colonial father to run to in case of need.\r\nMost of the measures we propose increase tax revenues. But there is a second purpose for tax reform, besides increasing government revenue. We wish as well to distribute income more equitably and to reduce the consumption of luxuries, especially those that are imported. The measures we recommend are thus of several kinds.\r\nSome of these rationalize the existing tax structure. These comprise the measures to promote a more equitable distribution of income tax collection between the national and local governments; to amend certain sections of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines; and to revise the rates on the individual income tax, some rates downward and other rates upward.\r\nOther measures increase particular taxes, in the interests both of raising national savings and government revenues, and of discouraging conspicuous consumption, which is particularly harmful in this period of threatening unrest. These measures include increasing amusement taxes and specific taxes on certain distilled spirits and fermented liquors; requiring the payment of certain charges for foreign travel and for the registration of motor vehicles; increasing the rates of corporate income tax; and increasing the specific tax on oils and other fuels.\r\nOur final revenue proposal imposes a temporary surtax for economic development purposes. The main aim of this surtax is to enable us to carry on several essential capital programs, which have long been necessary and are more essential now than ever before, but have been suspended for lack of funds. The collections from this surtax are to be allocated to a special economic development fund, which is to be used solely for capital projects. The surtax is to be charged on certain taxes; but it is to be strictly temporary. It will cease when the backlog of capital projects has been erased, and will not in any case be imposed for more than four years.\r\nBy all these means, we hope to raise by prudent methods about P1 billion for capital projects over the next four years. Our past performance guarantees that the funds will be spent wisely; and if these measures are passed, especially the last, there will be an additional guarantee, in that we shall be spreading more widely the national stake in economic development, and hence the national determination that economic development does take place.\r\nAt the same time, we must make sure that private entrepreneurs channel their energies and their funds in the ways that best promote economic development. We remain committed to free enterprise; controls are a cumbersome and an inefficient tool. Our method is simply to make certain industry lines attractive to private business as well as essential to development. In the encouragement of priority lines industries, the Board of Investments and the Presidential Economic Staff will take a leading part.\r\nWe are also determined that this development should be primarily in the hands, and in the benefit, of Filipino nationals. But this places on us the obligation of making clear precisely what the conditions are that we impose on foreign investment. This we have already done in general principle, with the passage of the Investment Incentives Act, but there are a few particular uncertainties that must be cleared up immediately.\r\nFor the guidance of private investment, domestic as well as foreign, we are therefore considering two measures among others. The first of these is the reclassification of land used by factories as nonagricultural. This is a classification that conforms more closely than the present one to the facts. It has the further advantage of acting as an incentive to the promotion and continuance of productive investment.\r\nA second uncertainty concerns the definition of the term national treatment with respect to foreign investment, especially in the fields of manufacturing, commerce, and finance. This should be cleared up by congressional action.\r\nFinally, the mining law should be revised to encourage exploration for domestic sources of petroleum. The present law classifies the processing of petroleum from domestic sources as a public utility, and is hence severely restrictive to foreigners; but it does not so restrict the processing of petroleum from foreign sources. Thus, our petroleum industry remains heavily import-dependent. Domestic entrepreneurs have the incentive to prospect for oil here, but not the resources. Foreign companies have the resources and knowledge, but not the incentive.\r\nIt is difficult to justify this policy, especially in the present circumstances. The discovery here of oil in commercial quantities would be a tremendous asset, not only to our international reserves but also to our national security. We should no longer deny ourselves this possible good fortune.\r\nIn all these matters, we will adopt a broad approach, marked by four related guidelines. They are\r\nWe will also encourage cooperation between our banking system on the one hand, and our manufacturers on the other, towards the production of capital equipment for our industries and possibly for export. It is an established fact that our engineering industries are capable of turning out equipment, components, and other durable consumer goods at lesser cost than their counterparts in other countries. What is needed in this respect is a financing arrangement between our public and private financing agencies and our manufacturers, which will render financially feasible the undertaking of significant capital goods production.\r\nSince its enactment in 1939, the National Internal Revenue Code, which is the basis of our existing tax system, has remained basically the same. About 72% of tax revenues are from indirect taxes; the remaining 28% come from direct taxes. This must now be revised.\r\nA realistic tax program, one attuned to the development requirements as well as the structure of our society, is now imperative. We must produce a system which would not only increase tax revenues for financing intensified government action in economic development but also distribute the tax burden fairly and justly. The rich, rather than the poor, should bear the greater weight of the tax responsibility.\r\nIt is important that the funds we seek to generate shall be utilized with extreme prudence. I shall therefore define as clearly as possible the major areas in which we must sustain or accelerate our development efforts, and mark out the funds that shall be utilized to finance them exclusively.\r\nI propose tax measures for the following special funds, and their corresponding uses:\r\nI have saved until the end, to emphasize their overriding importance, the measures to alleviate the most critical of the problems that still confront us. This is the shortage of foreign exchange. Our development program requires, in addition to heavy investment, large imports of capital goods and some raw materials; and recent world developments indicate that we may shortly have either to give up some of our protected markets or share them with other developing countries. Furthermore, the improvement of our export earnings requires that we first improve our relations with other countries, so that external trade becomes a question of international prestige as well as of national development. The world at large, as well as our national entrepreneurs, will judge us by the efficiency with which we act on these measures.\r\nThe most urgent of these is the impending negotiation of our economic relations with the United States. A preparatory discussion has been held in Baguio in which we succeeded in making our wishes known and, even at that early stage, securing agreement on two important matters. The first of these is the American acceptance of the principles of the Charter of Algiers: Nonreciprocal preferences should be granted to developing nations, and therefore important Philippine exports will be assured of continued entry into the United States. In the event of general preferences being granted, Philippine exports are also assured of additional special preferences, at least until 1974. The second is their agreement that problems arising out of the termination of the Laurel-Langley Agreement will be resolved through the Philippine judicial process.\r\nBut that conference was only a preliminary exchange of views. The actual negotiations might take place in a few months; and for this, preparations must be undertaken immediately. Furthermore, the outcome of the negotiations will be a new treaty of economic relations between the Philippines and the United States, to replace the Laurel-Langley Agreement. Congress, as well as the Office of the President, is therefore involved, and Congress most directly, for it will have the final responsibility for the result.\r\nCommittees should therefore immediately be set up in Congress to discuss these questions. Our entire economic relationship with the United States should be reviewed. We must attempt to gauge the national feeling as to what concessions we are willing to grant the Americans, and what we wish to accept from them in return. We must send to the United States a well-prepared negotiating panel, with Congress and private business well represented.\r\nOur economic relations with other countries also need to be tidied up. There are treaties already negotiated and awaiting approval with the United States on tax relations, and with Japan, Germany, and Sweden. Action should be taken on these as soon as possible, and in accordance with the will of Congress.\r\nAs a last measure in the field of international economic relations, we must increase our international bargaining power. Alone, we are economically weak against the industrial giants of the world; in union with similar countries in the Southeast Asian region, we can carry a little more weight. Our relations with these countries will be examined; we are particularly interested in the idea of a regional payments union.\r\nOn the domestic front, our own exporters are in need of more incentives. They must be encouraged to export more, and different things, to different markets. In this way, we protect ourselves from the uncertainty of being tied to a few buyers of a few products. In addition to the encouragement provided by the Investment Incentives Act, we should therefore like to see a special incentives act for exporters, in which additional tax exemptions are granted in proportion to the degree of domestic processing. A particularly attractive measure is the creation of an export processing zone. All activities within this zone would be tax-exempt; but taxes and duties would be levied if goods manufactured therein were to enter the domestic market.\r\nOther measures are needed as well to increase productivity and efficiency in our traditional export industries, especially sugar, coconut products, and mineral production. And we must continue to attempt the restriction of nonessential imports. The measures currently in force have achieved some success, and there is hope that more restrictive measures will not be necessary.\r\nBy these and similar measures, of which I shall submit full particulars as the session progresses, our balance of payments may be improved to the extent and measure necessary.\r\nPolitics is the art of decision through the will of the majority. Supposedly, both the majority and minority parties are mere instruments of the people for the enforcement of their will.\r\nThe record of performance as well as its criticism has been submitted to the sovereign people.\r\nThe popular mandate in the last elections was clear: It was a mandate for the vigorous pursuit of a policy of performance directed to the improvement of the lives of the people, but especially in terms of their basic needs\u2014food, clothing, shelter, and education.\r\nThis was not only a mandate for performance, but a verdict against excessive politics. On this point there can be no mistaking the popular will and temper.\r\nThe election of 1967 has just occupied our nation. Now the signs indicate excessive political activity for 1969.\r\nI ask you to unite with us now in a concerted effort to promote our development efforts because this year should afford us a respite from politics and partisanship. This is our last year for constructive legislation. The 1969 elections should not be allowed to engage our thoughts and energies now and deflect us from the more urgent tasks demanded by the welfare of our people.\r\nThose who persist in politicking at so late or so early an hour deserve the reproach and censure of the whole nation.\r\nThis is one of the tragedies of our democracy. But under my administration all parties have agreed by law to limit the period of political activity to three months for the local level and five months for the national level. This decision we all welcome as a guarantee against either majority or minority party members being guided by narrow selfish interest, their eyes dimmed by the prospect of the next election no matter how distant it may be, to the prejudice of the entire nation.\r\nThe need of the hour is to have men whose perceptions are clear. We must break from the crippling habits of the past. Let us cultivate only those ways and customs that will make us an effective and progressive people.\r\nI appeal to all, whatever be your party or whether partyman or not, to discard politics, at least this year. There will be enough time for the cruel, pitiless, exhausting, time-consuming, and often sterile and pointless pursuit of politics in 1969.\r\nHistory may not record what we say. But it will record what we do. Let us now discard the pernicious habits of the past.\r\nI hope and pray that the high-minded and noble responsibility of lawmaking will prevail over partisanship and personal ambition.\r\nTo change their lives, men must first change themselves. The challenge of nation-building is first of all a call to character-building.\r\nIt is the business of a free people to develop habits proper to freedom to be purposeful, active, energetic, and strong. We must, at the very least, continue the pace that has been set in the past two years, the pace and tempo that mark a nation of achievers.\r\nThus, may our people achieve their own development and write their own story of nation-building.\r\nFrom a race despondent, weak, vacillating, resigned, and helpless, groping for salvation, to a nation confident, bold, and resolute, seeking not survival alone but progress.\r\nFrom a nation of the ningas cogon to a nation of achievers.\r\nLet this be our epic of nation-building.", "title": "A Nation of Achievers"},
{"delivered": "1964-01-27 14:35:12+00:00", "author": "Diosdado Macapagal", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 27, 1964]\r\n\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Congress:\r\nFor the third time, I have the honor to appear before you and to present to you a report on the state of our nation. Two dramatic and eventful years have passed: this Administration now begins its third year in office. It is the projection of the past two years upon the future welfare and security of the nation which I would like to discuss with you on this occasion.\r\nThe welfare of our people has, without doubt, been substantially advanced. Not all improvements are immediately recognizable or easily detected, but there can be no question that our rate of growth as shown by all valid indicators points to continued expansion and development.\r\nUnfortunately, political partisanship has caused some delay in the progress which this Administration endeavoured to achieve during the past two years. Partisan bickering among the political parties not only retarded progress and slowed the pace of development but also rendered impossible the full achievement of our objectives. However, we are a young nation and a bright future lies ahead of us. The past years of frustration must make way for future years of fulfilment. This must be done if we are to tip the scales against the disappointments of the past in favour of the hopes of the future.\r\nWhile we have advanced in nearly all fields, our progress has not been as rapid or adequate as this Administration had desired. During the past two years, this Congress found itself unable to cooperate fully with the aims and purposes of the Administration owing mainly to the fact that the opposition held political control, first over both and then later over one of the Houses of Congress. It is my unhappy duty to report to our people that, as a result of bitter political conflict, the welfare of the people has often been overlooked, cast aside, or completely ignored. Members and leaders of all parties\u2014all of us\u2014have been guilty of playing too much politics, of leaving the work to those whose ability, no matter how outstanding, must prove unavailing unless they have the support of those in all the parties who have thus far placed politics above service to the people.\r\nThis is a different Congress. Both Houses of this Congress are now composed of a majority of Senators and Congressmen belonging to the party of the Administration. We now have a situation which better conforms to the accepted norm of representative government. It gives full scope to the system of political parties. While encouraging cooperation among the parties in the larger national interest it pinpoints party responsibility for the conduct of national affairs. Thus, the passage of new laws and the revision of old laws in the public interest can now be more easily undertaken. This must be done in order to enable this nation to achieve further progress toward the social and economic goals which we have envisioned for our people and for future generations to come.\r\nBefore this Congress stands you President himself tempered by the fire of honest self-appraisal. After two years of searching and endeavour, of sowing the seeds for better things, we may look forward to a bountiful harvest that will give greater hope to our people, as well as a destiny full of bright and exciting challenges.\r\nLet us lay aside our political differences and work for the common goal: the good of our people. I hasten to assure you that the best interest of the people has been and will continue to be the prime consideration in all my acts and in all my deeds. We have passed through two years\u2014a million moments filled with happiness as well as anxiety, with the thrill of success as well as the horror of failure. They have been moments of frustration and discouragement, of misunderstanding and regret, of hope and achievement. These are the million moments of the past two years which have been shared by us all: the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the haves and the have-nots.\r\nOur phrase, the \u201cNew Era,\u201d has been both acclaimed and derided. Our honest desire is to create out of this land the kind of country our people deserve\u2014a country able to satisfy the needs and serve the welfare of all its inhabitants, and to guarantee the protection and the security of this generation and of all generations to come. We have all been guilty of some neglect\u2014some of us to a greater degree than others. I am aware that we have not as yet been able to satisfy in just measure the hopes and aspirations of our people which we envisioned two years ago. Since we share the same hopes of achievement for our glorious land and our heroic people, can we not now all join together to give them those things which they so justly deserve? Can we not now forsake our own narrow self-interest and devote our whole strength to the realization of greater progress and happiness throughout the land?\r\nWith the help of this Congress, we shall achieve our national goals far beyond our fondest dreams. With courage and honesty of conviction, with force and power of determination to move steadily forward, we can overcome the plagues and corrupting diseases which have weakened the national fiber and so restore the health of the body politic that we may accomplish without further delay the tasks that need urgently to be done.\r\nAll this requires courage, determination, understanding, trust and cooperation. We are one nation of Filipinos, brothers one unto the other, with God-given aims and purposes, and God-given means and abilities to achieve those aims and purposes.\r\nWe have all allowed ourselves to become confused and to lose sight of our true objectives. We have been blinded by power politics and its self-serving aims. We have been led into making utterances and performing deeds which have neither serve the present needs of our people nor nourished their hopes for a better life. How amazing and unbelievable it seems that some of those who are called upon to help the people have succumbed to the temptations of personal ambition and the lust for power! As I look back to these past few years utilized but only in part for the fulfilment of our pledges and the hopes of our people, and of which so great a portion has been wasted through misunderstanding, intolerance, selfishness, and luck of trust, I realize that our people can no longer be condemned indefinitely to endure the penalty of self-serving purposes and deeds. We must face the bitter truth that the politicians of our country\u2014and I speak for all of us\u2014have, in fact, given to our people neither all the goodness nor all the ability nor all the love which we pledged to them and which they, in turn, expected from us.\r\nWe must work together as one, with respect for one another, with single intent to achieve through cooperation that which is best for all and to help each other do that which is right for the good of all. Not one of us is perfect, but collectively we can pursue and attain our hopes and through mutual confidence show one to the other the error of our ways. The great sin is not in making a mistake but in refusing to recognize the mistake and to correct it.\r\nThis is the beginning of our third year in office. I have examined the road we have travelled, a road full of trials and tribulations. I have looked back over these past two years not as a politician with ready excuses nor as a candidate with new promises to make, but as a President with duties and responsibilities to you and to our people.\r\nI have tried in this way to determine honestly in my own mind the success or failure of my efforts as President. In this mood of candid self-appraisal I must say that I am not quite satisfied with the results which have been achieved. I am not happy over the mistakes which could have been avoided. So much more could have been done. So much more must of necessity, be accomplished during the next two years before we can honestly say to ourselves and to our God: \u201cWe have done our true and sincere best for our people, within the measure of our abilities according to our lights.\u201d\r\nAs we examine ourselves in relation to the state of the nation, what can we, in truth, say of ourselves? I cannot speak for you, but this I will say for myself: Never will I be able to give all that I desire, but with a courage born of the lessons learned in sorrow during the past two years, I must and I shall devote my waking hours, life itself, to the welfare of our people. No difficulty or obstacle, however stubborn or forbidding, shall alter my course or change my will.\r\nWe must provide a better life for our people. We must give less comfort to ourselves. We must provide more hope to our nation. We must seek less gratification ourselves.\r\nWhere do we go from here\u2014from whence have we come? That which we can do is based solely on that which we have done: \u201cFor as ye sow, so shall ye reap.\u201d\r\nThis Administration has tried to hasten the nation\u2019s economic growth and improve public morality. We have resolved to attend as well to the problems of health, education, labor, social welfare, national security, cultural and scientific development, the administration of justice, the maintenance of peace and order, and foreign relations. These are the duties of this Administration. These duties are first and paramount.\r\nThis Administration has, during the past years, endeavoured to established a high standard of morality and conduct among government officials. This we felt in order to set a basic standard of conduct for the entire citizenry. We feel that we have been able to instill in the minds of the people the fact that as it prosecutes its drive for public morality, the Administration will never, under any circumstance, countenance graft and corruption. Corruption among government officials has to marked degree diminished, but it has not been completely eradicated though eradicated it must be.\r\nWe have achieved a decontrolled economy with a stable exchange rate. This no one can deny. We have improved our intentional reserves. We have had favourable balances of trade and favourable balances of payments during the past two years. Our per capita income is on the rise. Our industrial production continues to increase as does our agricultural output. The Land Reform Program is under way. A nationwide housing program for lower income groups has been launched. These are some of the good things which we in the Administration have done in our time.\r\nOur industries have increased their use of local raw materials for the benefit of all, and as a result of our controversial but successful program of decontrol, substantial investments have been realized with the employment of both local and foreign capital so as to help establish the solid economic base for further growth.\r\nFree enterprise has continued to prosper, and the era of stifling control seems now but a bad dream. New gigantic industries to promote the national welfare, such as steel, chemicals, pulp, and fertilizer, are underway. The prospects of employment improve in spite of our population explosion.\r\nThe establishment of these and similar enterprises will cause the proliferation of small and vital industries which will then provide the framework for self-sustained economic growth.\r\nThis Congress and the Administration have taken steps to abolish the share tenancy system and have given hope to the small farmer to produce for himself on an independent basis. The agricultural land reform code is an impressive and enduring monument to the farsightedness of our lawmakers. It may be difficult to enforce effectively, but enforce it we must if the future of our economic system is to be assured.\r\nOur nation\u2019s conduct in the field of international relations during the past two years has been characterized by a far more active participation in international affairs, particularly in the affairs of Southeast Asia. We have willingly accepted the challenge to carry the democratic message in our part of the world; we have played a prominent role in Maphilindo, the association of peoples of Malay origin; we have made progress on our claim to Sabah (North Borneo); we have assisted in mediating disputes between nations. Relationships of lasting importance have been formed between our country and the United States, as well as a number of Asian countries including Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, Mexico, and the new nations of Africa, particularly Madagascar.\r\nWithout diminishing our historic relations with the United States and other Western countries and without weakening our commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights, we have sought to expand our role in Asian affairs and thereby promote the stability and security of our region and enhance mutual understanding between the peoples of Asia and the people of the West.\r\nOn matters of foreign policy, the active counsel and cooperation of all parties in Congress will be sought at every opportunity.\r\nAll is not glory. Our people suffer from the continuing increase of prices and the short supply of rice. These price increases are the result no longer of decontrol, but of subsequent domestic and external pressures. The rice insufficiency in the country is aggravated by a world shortage of this commodity. To excuse ourselves or to blame others is of no moment now; what is imperative is a resolute approach to the solution of these problems.\r\nFor the future, all of us must work together to lay a new, solid foundation which will adequately utilize the natural resources which are our birthright. We must give confidence to our people. You and I must live up to and fulfil the degree of trust and confidence which our people have placed in us.\r\nWe must keep up the drive against graft.\r\nWe must implement more vigorously our program of economic and social progress and the ascendency of Filipinos in the national economy.\r\nWe must continue our active participation in foreign affairs, particularly those that affect our national interest.\r\nWe must increase our tax revenues and facilitate public borrowing to finance the various requirements rapid economic development.\r\nWe must establish an ef\u00adfective administrative organization for economic de\u00advelopment within the con\u00adtext of decentralized gov\u00adernment.\r\nWe must make credit available to investors within the framework of a sta\u00adble currency.\r\nWe must find a satisfac\u00adtory solution to the prob\u00adlem of rising prices.\r\nWe must insure an ade\u00adquate rice supply to the people as we seek self-suf\u00adficiency through increased production.\r\nWe must provide ready employment opportunities while stable jobs are being created under the econo\u00admic program.\r\nWe must attract and give assurances to private investments, both domes\u00adtic and foreign.\r\nWe must increase the minimum wage while as\u00adsuring a reasonable margin of profit for employers.\r\nWe must implement a nationwide housing pro\u00adgram for our slum and hut dwellers.\r\nWe must intensify the development of tourism as a source of dollar revenue.\r\nWe must act together to fight and destroy smug\u00adgling.\r\nWe must improve fur\u00adther the administration of justice.\r\nWe must improve and strengthen the local police forces all over the coun\u00adtry.\r\nWe must adopt electoral reforms to frustrate frauds and exorbitant spending by candidates.\r\nThe hope of our nation lies in our hands. The state of the nation lies in our hearts. I pledge to you for the sake of our country, my fullest cooperation and resolve to rid our nation of the many evils which have in the past plagued our land and sapped our strength and vitality.\r\nThe state of our nation ultimately depends upon our true and honest ap\u00adpraisal of ourselves, our understanding, our confi\u00addence, and our ability to sacrifice for the good of the mass of our people ra\u00adther than for the welfare of any particular group. We must cast off the false masks of the image-makers; the time has come to be ourselves so that what we are will shine through our works. Determined to correct the mistakes of the past and to undertake new and more hopeful initia\u00adtives for the future. I ap\u00adpeal to you for mutual understanding so that with a mighty will we shall labor and sacrifice together to give our people the good life they desire and deserve, but which has been denied them for so long. Let us cast aside petty personal jealousies and partisan politics from our lives; let us work only for the common good.

Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 26, 1970]\r\nThis is for me a historic privilege. No man can be exalted higher than to be chosen twice by his own people to lead them; this, at a time of great anxieties and great expectations for the nation and for the world.\r\nPermit me, then, to begin this report by thanking our people for their mandate, and congratulating all those who were elected to office in the last elections.\r\nBut the honor of this mandate pales beside its gravity. I interpret this mandate not just as a call to continue in office, but a summons to supreme self-exertion in the service of the nation.\r\nOur country summons us all to exert ourselves to the limit of our God-given powers, endurance, and wisdom to raise the nation to a bold, new future.\r\nThe situation in the world, as well as that in the Philippines, is marked by sweeping change.\r\nWe cannot move forward within the grooves of old habits and outmoded institutions. Progress demands that the barriers of centuries be broken.\r\nBut the pursuit of development and the breaking of barriers to progress require such energy and endurance as may strain our resources, both of the public and the private sectors. Thus, the balance of payments problem is now the most immediate and urgent challenge facing our country.\r\nBut from an intimate knowledge of our problems, I know and I say that there is no reason to be afraid of the dollar gap. It can and will be bridged in a short time. We should be more concerned about the moral gap\u2014a gap in our self-confidence and our strength of purpose as a nation, a gap that threatens all classes of people in all stations of life.\r\nWe must turn these difficulties and problems into opportunities to strengthen our moral fiber as a people, to temper our will and character, to imbue the nation with a permanent sense of discipline so necessary to the achievement of progress.\r\nToday, we must offer the alternative to anarchy\u2014a constructive nationalism, not a vituperative chauvinism.\r\nThere is ferment and a desire for change. Many cannot describe, nor do they know, the change that they aspire for, but the instinct is there; let the leaders in government help define and outline it for them.\r\nWe must offer reforms in the electoral system, abolish social iniquity, work out a government machinery reorganization, provide a modernized penal system, discard feudalism and at the same time oppose fascism.\r\nWe must be understanding, even with those who refuse to understand us.\r\nFor when we establish priorities in development, many will question their lack of standing in such a plan of development as well as in the listing of expenditures. Sometimes we must suffer in silence, for they will question not only our acts but also our motives as well. Silent we will be, aware as we are that ultimately\u2014as the expression goes\u2014the truth will out, as it always will. These are hazards of authority and leadership. This is the measure of responsibility. You and I must patiently explain.\r\nGovernment today is often charged with being insensitive, likened to a corporation without a soul. We must demonstrate that government does have the capacity for compassion\u2014for the weak, the underprivileged, and the destitute. All the agencies of the government must respond to the needs and problems of the common people.\r\nOur confidence in the future rests on a solid base, namely, our present achievements. The past four years have shown that the spirit of the Filipino people, properly challenged, will more than match the dimensions of the challenges they have to confront.\r\nThe only condition is that the nation discipline itself towards its goals. I am not speaking of discipline imposed by a tyrannical government, but of self-discipline in the active exercise of freedom.\r\nDiscipline is our salvation as a nation and the key to our future greatness.\r\nWe can no longer plead as an excuse immaturity or smallness in the world. We have grown in population to 37 million people, making us the 15th largest nation. Among the developing countries, we rank seventh in the world in population. Countries similar to us in geographical area, such as Great Britain and Japan, have demonstrated their capacity to become world leaders. We do not, we need not, aspire to world leadership. We do have the potential to play a larger role in world affairs. But first, we must acquire the discipline of self-denial, the ability to sacrifice present gratification and ease for permanent and lasting national progress.\r\nI ask the leaders of our government\u2014including the members of the Seventh Congress\u2014to set the example and lead the way for national self-discipline.\r\nLet me now turn to the facts of our economy.\r\nOur economy is developing vigorously.\r\nThe economic difficulties\u2014namely, the balance of payments problem and inflation\u2014that beset us are consequences of the massive capital expenditures that we made and not of stagnation. As such, they are temporary and can be surmounted. But to surmount them, we need strength of purpose and discipline. We have to subordinate our personal desires to the needs and aspirations of the nation. We have to train ourselves to use our resources carefully and fruitfully.\r\nTo get an overview of our economic state and to provide a context for our new programs, allow me to review the economic gains of the past four years.\r\nThe impulse of growth, which compels the most intense application of government resources into the process of national expansion, was well on the scene in the four years that ended in 1969.\r\nIn those four years, we sought to retrieve the economy from stagnation and decay, and in 1969 it was possible for us to see that our labors had paid off. Revived in purpose and seeking. To pursue larger goals, we found the evidence of our achievement not only in concrete roads, bridges, schoolhouses, and other such palpable things but above all in the new determination of the people and government not to cruise along its difficulties but rather to confront them with all the resources at our command.\r\nAt this point, it is important to note three salient points relevant to economic activity:\r\nThe growth of the economy and the vigorous implementation of development programs by the government had the corollary effect of expanding the employment opportunities of the people.\r\nJob opportunities in 1969 maintained the annual average increase of 647,000 new jobs, which represents 220% increase over the 1965 figures. This massive increase is of particular significance because its main beneficiary was the rural areas, where employment opportunities soared to a record annual average of 453,000.\r\nThe principal targets in our economic development plan have been exceeded. You are aware of the figures and I shall not repeat them.\r\nWe have adopted a budget for expenditures of our dollars. This will limit importation of both producer and consumer goods and will tend to increase prices in our country, especially because of the tendency to order even those unnecessary imports. Accordingly, we have asked the help of the International Monetary Fund, which sent a team of experts for consultations with our monetary authorities. We will not, however, agree to the devaluation of our peso which may cause untold suffering to our lower classes; nor will we accept outright controls. Either places our economy in rigid limits.\r\nThe International Monetary Fund consultative team is now studying with our monetary authorities the courses open to us without devaluation and without controls.\r\nIn the meantime, I have insisted that the plight of our economy be alleviated by the lifting of the suspension of guarantees by the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank and the allowance of the importation of essential consumer goods.\r\nI have been informed by these authorities that the situation in the Philippines is not as grievous as most of our detractors would like us to believe. Accordingly, I am assured that with the proper measures, after a period of six months we should recover from this temporary imbalance in our economy.\r\nIn the meantime, we must be patient even with the most impatient among our people. No one is more in a hurry for development and for improvements than I. But I repeat I must balance the public good against the welfare of the few, and naturally you and I must always choose the general welfare against limited welfare.\r\nBut we must be understanding to even those who refuse to understand us. This must be our policy.\r\nIn the past four years, our principal programs were the infrastructure, the educational system, agricultural development, land reform, manpower training, and the encouragement of exports. We will continue with these programs and add to them the new program of tourism, rural electrification, and emphasis on export-oriented industries, as well as the establishment of trade schools all over the country.\r\nSince the start of the Four-Year Program in 1966, encouragement was given to export-oriented industries, industries utilizing indigenous raw materials, and industries creating backward and forward linkages in the economy, through our Investment Incentives Act which you approved several years ago.\r\nSince then, our Board of Investments has approved as of 1969, 128 projects from 221 applications.\r\nI reiterate my congratulations to the Sixth Congress for the speedy enactment of the bill establishing a Free Trade Zone in Mariveles, Bataan. We have laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Free Trade Zone.\r\nThis is an experiment. It is my hope that once this succeeds you will be able to establish other free trade zones in other ports of the country. The economic benefits that this will generate are tremendous and far-reaching. The free trade zone has aroused enthusiastic interest not only here but abroad.\r\nDuring the past three calendar years, mineral production reached the billion-peso mark, registering an increase of 73% in 1968 over that in 1965. Production increased further the following year with a total output valued at P1,048.1 million.\r\nProduction of precious metals, including platinum and palladium, for 1969, reached a total of P124.6 million; base metals, P607.3 million; nonmetals, including cement, P316.2 million.\r\nWe not only surpassed the planned targets of the first Four-Year Plan; we continued to surpass them at accelerating rates. Actual growth in real terms of our gross national product increased from 6.2% in 1966 and 1967 to 6.4% in 1968 and 6.5% in 1969.\r\nOur economy is on the verge of take off to self-sustaining growth. Measured against 1967 prices, our gross national product for 1969 reached P27.783 billion, surpassing planned targets by 9.4%.\r\nMore important, we successfully increased the absorptive capacity of our economy for investments through government infrastructure investments, incentives and assistance to private industry. We have arrested the erratic fluctuation of our economy and maintained consistent growth.\r\nThe year 1969 was marked by deterioration in the foreign exchange position of the Philippines accompanied by expansion in money supply and a relatively modest rate of increase in prices.\r\nRice, roads, schools, and other essential projects of the government, as well as the capital goods required by an expanding industrial sector, were the factors, in concrete form, which helped increase money supply and weighed heavily on the demand for imports. Directly, the implementation of these programs required the importation of many types of machinery, communications equipment, railway, and other transport equipment. Indirectly, through the purchasing power released in the wake of their implementation, these programs also gave rise to increased demand for imported consumer goods and for domestically produced goods. Since the production of the latter required the heavy importation of raw materials, increased demand for domestic goods also meant added pressure on the country\u2019s limited supply of foreign exchange.\r\nAnother major cause in the reduction of the foreign exchange resources was the higher level of activity of business firms, particularly those in the export sector. As in the case of firms producing goods for domestic consumption, these export firms were heavily dependent on imported machinery as well as imported raw materials to bring about an expansion in their production.\r\nA third cause of the heavy demand for foreign exchange which, however, could only be indirectly traced to the excessive credit for monetary expansion in the economy was of more recent origin. These were the speculatory activities centering on devaluation and exchange controls, which induced business firms to import more than their normal requirements and build up their inventories, thus contributing to the fall in the reserve.\r\nIn the face of all these problems, the Central Bank has made the following moves: (1) raised the reserve requirement of all banking institutions by two percentage points; and (2) raised the rate of special time deposit (STD) requirements in order to mop up excess liquidity.\r\nA related measure to these twin deflationary moves was the adoption of a program of dispersing part of money supply, now overly concentrated in centers of population, to the rural areas; this should lead to a reduction in the velocity of circulation of money, an effect equivalent to a reduction in the volume of money.\r\nCognizant of the initial effects that these new measures would have on production, employment and prices, the Central Bank further took steps to ensure the immediate and continuous availability of raw supplies and materials to industrial establishments. These firms were allowed to open automatically letters of credit equivalent to 55% of their 1968 importations, spread out on a quarterly basis.\r\nFor the long run, in order to revise the production patterns of the economy, measures have been devised to promote a more outward-looking, export-oriented type of development. In cooperation with other government agencies, the Central Bank stands ready to adopt additional facilities for export industries. With the support given to these industries, the heavy dependence of the economy on imports should be reduced. The wherewithal to provide the foreign exchange necessary for imports or for such other imports, which an increase in foreign exchange earnings (and thus in money supply) will induce, will be forthcoming.\r\nIf these and other monetary and fiscal measures that are being considered can be successfully implemented, then the base will have been laid for an economic structure that will not only be able to overcome the present foreign exchange difficulties of the country but also enable the country to achieve a consistently high rate of growth.\r\nThe question is often asked: Why were our dollar expenditures more than our dollar earnings? Let me remind our people that this is a free society; that up to now we have not imposed controls. Correspondingly, we were all free to import, to travel, and to spend abroad as much as each could afford. Today, government expenditures have therefore been restrained, public works projects suspended except the maintenance of communications and the continuation of ongoing projects, credit has been restricted, industrial and commercial loans by government financing institutions have been stopped. So have the guarantees given by the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank been suspended.\r\nOur economy has been temporarily placed in a straitjacket.\r\nOur external sector, it is true, continues to hamper our development efforts. But despite last year\u2019s drought and an almost 25% reduction of our exports of copra and coconut products, total exports still grew by 6.4%. An outstanding development was the growth of almost 60% in the export of copper concentrates.\r\nWe have managed to maintain import levels to that of 1968; imports grew by only 0.2%. This reduction came primarily through a reduction of importation for consumption. Consumption imports dropped to 12.6%, and imports of producer goods now comprise 87.4% of total imports.\r\nThis emphasizes the need to promote and to diversify exports.\r\nAs usual, agriculture led other sectors with a growth rate of 7.6%; mining and manufacturing followed with 5.9%, transport and communications with 4.5%, and commerce and services with 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. Only construction registered a downward trend of 0.8%.\r\nDespite the rice scare in August and the complaints about high prices, average consumer prices for the entire country moved up by only 1.7% in 1969. Average Consumer Price Index for December 1968 was 154.1 against the CPI index of 156.7 in 1969, an increase of 2.6 index points or 1.7%.\r\nThis is a far cry from the average 5.0 and 5.9% increases in consumer prices we experienced in 1966 and 1967, and way below worldwide trends of spiraling prices. Forty-one countries surveyed in 1968 showed price increases ranging from 12 to 455%.\r\nExcept for August and December when speculation unnecessarily raised prices by 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively, monthly increases in prices in 1969 consistently remained below 1%.\r\nWe have intensified revenue collections. In the past four years, the total BIR and Customs collections rose to P10,128.13 million, an increase of P8,558.81 million over that of the previous administration.\r\nWe undertook major reforms in our operations. In the Bureau of Internal Revenue, these included the strict implementation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the use of electronic and data machines and various drives to increase voluntary tax compliance.\r\nIn the Bureau of Customs, these reforms included administrative measures for greater autonomy in different offices, adoption of the \u201cimmediate payment system\u201d in obtaining the release of importations from Customs, the standardization of the classification and valuation of imports, upgrading of law enforcement agencies, expansion and improvement of port facilities, opening of new principal ports of entry, and providing new incentives to boost tourism.\r\nErring personnel were dealt with accordingly. One hundred ninety-six criminal cases were filed against officials and employees in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and 215 cases were filed against undesirable employees and officials in the Bureau of Customs.\r\nSound principles and practices in fiscal management in the conduct of local treasury operations were installed to enhance the financial viability of local governments.\r\nTreasury operations were improved. From FY 1966 to FY 1969, the total gross receipts of the National Treasury accruing to the general fund amounted to P9,994.96 million, an increase of P2,640.72 million or 35.9% over the period from FY 1962 to FY 1965.\r\nThe net receipts of the general fund during the last four years were P8,835.10 million compared to P6,348.65 million under the previous administration, an increase of P2,456.56 million or 33.5%.\r\nWe upgraded the management of the public debt by establishing a Treasury Bills Program and developing a Bill Market, issuing Tax Anticipation Bills, issuing the \u201cGold Subsidy Series\u201d of treasury bills, and creating the Financial Policy Committee.\r\nWe improved the insurance business, putting an end to the unhealthy competition that once obtained because of the uncontrolled increase in the number of insurance companies.\r\nWe stabilized the embroidery industry.\r\nIn general, we protected Philippine industries, either through the imposition of special dumping duties or through the prohibition of entry, or control, of the quantity of imports that may injure, or prevent the establishment of, local industries.\r\nOne of the most gratifying results of our efforts in agriculture in the last four years is our successful rice and corn production campaign. Our national average yield of 30-40 cavans per hectare jumped to 60-80 cavans per hectare as a result of the introduction of high-yielding rice varieties and the installation of the proper infrastructure and credit facilities. Our national yield for corn also hit an average of 20 cavans per hectare.\r\nIt is highly possible that a surplus of rice will become apparent this year and in later years to come. For the time when we begin to sell rice in the international market, we will need an export policy for rice to insure a steady and reliable source for our buyers.\r\nThe Rice and Corn Administration may have to be authorized to issue export licenses to private traders at a pro rata share based on the milling capacity of their respective millers. In general, export licenses must be issued only for the export of high-quality long-grain varieties, unless it is clearly shown by the exporter that a demand exists for the medium and short-grain varieties.\r\nDuring the four-year period, the Department of Public Works and Communications built some 8,560 kilometers of concrete, asphalt, feeder, and development roads, and 21,770 lineal meters of permanent bridges at a cost of almost P623 million.\r\nDuring the same period, it constructed more than 57,100 schoolrooms all over the country.\r\nFor flood control, it constructed 26 kilometers of earth dikes, 4,678 lineal meters of revetments, and dredged about 3,274,000 cubic meters.\r\nIn portworks, it constructed 18.5 foreign berths, 53.5 domestic berths, and 50 lightcraft berths. It also constructed a substantial number of warehouses and cargo sheds, causeways and bulkheads, seawalls, and has reclaimed more than 2 hectares as port area.\r\nThe Civil Aeronautics Administration finished 50 projects and installed 18 air navigational systems.\r\nThe Bureau of Telecommunications has established 1,319 telegraph and radiotelegraph stations around the country.\r\nMicrowave links are also being established; 13 VHP/UHF radio stations have been completed.\r\nDuring the period covered, the Irrigation Services Unit installed 4,837 pump units benefitting an area of more than 128,000 hectares of riceland, capable of producing 10,000,000 cavans of palay per year.\r\nThe manufacturing sector of the economy expanded at a vigorous rate. Measured in terms of its contribution to the total net domestic product at constant 1955 prices, the manufacturing output increased at an average annual rate of 5.9% for the period 1966 to 1969 compared to an average growth rate of 4% for the period 1962 to 1965.\r\nThe Central Bank index of physical volume in manufacturing corroborates the trend. Manufacturing output rose by 31.2% from 196.7 in 1962 to 200.9 in 1965 as compared to a rise of 59.8% from 218.6 in 1966 to 258.8 in 1969. Nondurable manufactures gained by 27.7% during the period 1962-1965 as against a gain of 35.5% during the period 1966-1969, while durable manufactures increased by 48.1% for the same periods\r\nCommerce and trade contributed an average of 15% of the net domestic product at 1955 prices during the four-year period 1966-1969, and expanded at an average annual rate of 4.8% over the period.\r\nIn domestic trade, Filipino participation in the retail trade significantly increased since the Nationalization Act of 1954. This increase is a reflection of the implementation of the law. For the period 1966 to 1968, 94.8% of new retailers were Filipinos with an average capitalization of 87.5% of the total capital. For the previous four-year period, Filipino participation in the retail trade was only 90.6%, with a capitalization of only 88.3%.\r\nThe Greater Manila Terminal Food Market Inc. was established to facilitate the flow of goods from the production centers to the consumer areas, thus providing as well an accessible and convenient outlet for the produce of about 500,000 farmers in 27 provinces in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. This is a virtual revolution in marketing, benefitting farmers and wholesalers, retailers, and other intermediaries.\r\nThis marketing scheme is intended to stabilize, and perhaps even to decrease, the prices of prime commodities.\r\nIn foreign trade, we established a new record when our total overseas commerce reached a total value of $1.98 billion with an increase of about 27% over that in 1965 of $1.576 billion. While our exports increased by 10.1%, from $763.5 million to $848 million, our imports increased by 42.4%, from $807 million in 1965 to $1,150.2 million in 1968.\r\nThis trade imbalance, however, was caused by importations of capital equipment, raw materials, and semiprocessed goods by our various industries.\r\nOf the total value of imports during the Calendar Year 1965, 87.4% was spent for the purchase of machinery and equipment, raw materials, and supplies, and only 12.6% for consumer goods. For the year 1968, the relative percentages of imports of producer and consumer goods were 88.3% and 11.2%, respectively.\r\nThus, the trade imbalance has been largely brought about by the expanding industrial development of the country. However, there is a built-in correction in the imbalance, for once these industries begin to produce with the equipment imported, they will augment their own domestic requirements, substitute the goods currently imported, and provide a surplus for export.\r\nEventually, therefore, this imbalance will relieve the pressures on our international reserves and thus strengthen the country\u2019s credit and financial position abroad.\r\nUnder the leadership of the NACIDA, cottage industries have become an important part of the economy. Since 1965, a total of P161,097,087 have been earned by our cottage products. For 1969, the initial records give us hope that the value of exports of cottage products may reach the P100-million mark.\r\nIn terms of domestic investments alone, as of September 30, 1969, the capitalization of the 34,274 NACIDA-registered producers increased by P16,327,988.47 from a total of P63,860,991.72 in June 1968, making the capitalization total P80,188,980.19. These NACIDA-registered producers today employ 598,100 workers.\r\nLast October 7, 1969, we inaugurated the joint RP-Japan Technological and Development Center. In this modern laboratory in Marikina, Rizal, bamboocraft, rattancraft, ceramics, fibercraft, woodworking, forging, and small machine parts manufacture will be taught.\r\nThis administration pledges full support to our tourism industry. The following are some of the policies initiated to stimulate tourism:\r\nOur basic goal is prosperity and economic security for the bulk of our people. To bring this about, we must industrialize.\r\nFull attainment of this goal cannot come within the next few years. But it is our goal nonetheless. What can be attained in the coming years is economic takeoff.\r\nWe cannot let this opportunity for economic takeoff pass. Developed countries keep moving and other developing countries keep developing. The more we delay, the greater will be the gap between us and the advanced countries, the harder it will be to catch up or compete with them. Furthermore, a hesitation today will mean the negation of all our efforts and sacrifices in the past.\r\nA principal objective of our economic program is the development of a sizable domestic market. Employment can be increased substantially only if our industries can find markets of sufficient size as to warrant a high rate of absorption of labor into industrial employment. The infrastructure program has been an important first step in the extension of our domestic markets. Our price support program for agricultural products and our community development program have transferred purchasing power to the rural areas and broadened the base of the domestic market.\r\nThe next step is the stimulation of regional markets. Plans are in process to establish a number of free ports throughout the country to encourage direct regional exports to international markets. We intend to emphasize the development of secondary urban centers as growth points in each region through our capital expenditures program in the years to come. We have already started to decentralize industry away from Greater Manila; we shall provide additional incentives for further decentralization to these regional centers. The dispersal of institutions of higher learning and hospital facilities is to be encouraged. The reorganization and revitalization of regional development authorities under competent administrators shall be pursued. Finally, increased emphasis shall be given to the exploitation of mineral, marine, and agricultural resources on a regional level as the basis for stimulating regional income.\r\nOur goal in 1970 is to stabilize the economy and provide for readjustment and restructuring of production activities. To this end, we shall limit growth in real GNP in FY 1971 to 6.2% and real per capita income growth at 2.6%.\r\nThis growth rate in GNP and per capita income is sufficiently healthy to prevent unemployment, and at the same time sufficiently modest by now established Philippine standards to enable the stabilization and restructuring of our economy.\r\nTo achieve these goals, we shall follow various major policies, of which the more important are\r\nTo mop up excess liquidity and prevent fresh generation of new monies, the following measures will be adopted:\r\nTo bolster operating reserves of the Central Bank the following measures will be undertaken:\r\nReduction of imports and the lower level of economic activity will reduce the revenues of government. But the government will not borrow additional funds from the Central Bank. Instead the following fiscal and financial measures will be adopted:\r\nTo correct the imbalance in the structure of our external debt, the following measures will be taken:\r\nThe measures we have taken are essentially defensive and short-term in nature. They do not provide for our needs for long-term growth. To provide for our needs for long-term economic growth, the following measures will be undertaken:\r\nWith these stringent measures, we expect to correct our present situation within one year. It will not be necessary to change our foreign exchange rate or reimpose import restrictions as in the \u201850s to accomplish this.\r\nTo insure continued and accelerated growth in the future, the national government commits itself to the following undertakings:\r\nA. Capital Formation\r\nThe infrastructure program will be continued. Highway expenditures will be limited to those portions previously identified and recommended by the transport survey for their high benefit-cost ratios. The feeder road program will be expanded to catch up with the increased growth of agricultural production.\r\nOur infrastructure program will be geared to support tourism and the export trade.\r\nThe capital formation budget for the national government will be as follows:\r\nB. Production and Marketing\r\nHaving attained surplus production in our basic staple, the agricultural program will expand production in other food and cash crops, especially export crops.\r\nAgricultural credit will be assured through the rechanneling of excess liquidity from consumption into agricultural production. The Central Bank envisions some P250 million for this in 1970.\r\nUnlimited credit will be provided by the Central Bank for export as well as domestic production. Credit for importations will, however, remains restrictive. Guarantees for foreign loans by the DBP and the PNB will be issued selectively and confined primarily to priorities specified by the Board of Investments.\r\nIncentives and protection will be afforded Filipino retailers to broaden and upgrade the Filipino entrepreneurial base. Relevant government institutions like the Department of Commerce and Industry will be mobilized to extend the necessary assistance.\r\nC. Fiscal Planning\r\nIn all these developments, the policy of fiscal restraint will be adhered to. Our aim is not to increase expenditures but to restructure or to rechannel expenditures to promote greater economic growth.\r\nTotal government expenditures level for 1971 will be maintained at 1970 levels. Capital formation and improved and increased developmental expenditures will be funded from the increased tax take, and savings from government reorganization and rechanneling of government expenditures.\r\nFor 1971, we envision a cutback on current expenditures on goods and services of P120 million and P20 million on subsidies. This cutback will enable developmental services to expand by P140 million.\r\nReceipts from current revenues are expected to increase by P190 million, plus P420 million to be generated from the 12 new tax measures passed in 1968 and 1969 and the additional tax measures to be presented to this Congress session. The new taxes will dampen inflationary pressures, allow for freer government credit to the private sector, as well as enable a substantial portion of the infrastructure program to be financed by noninflationary means. Domestic borrowing for the capital development programs will be limited to P240 million and will come from noninflationary sources such as GSIS, SSS, and the common bond sinking fund.\r\nD. Solution of Balance of Payments Problem and Inflation\r\nThe most crucial economic problem we face today is our balance of payments. This is a problem caused by the development process. Specifically, it arose from the enthusiasm of the private sector to import more capital goods. Thus, although imports of consumer goods dropped to 12.6%, imports of capital goods increased to 87.4%.\r\nTo meet this problem, we have had to adopt certain measures, among them the suspension of certain projects and the restriction of credit.\r\nI have already discussed this problem and its solution.\r\nE. New Strategy for International Trade\r\nThe economic program shall give utmost priority to the foreign exchange earning sectors of the economy; this priority shall be enforced in the lending programs of government financial institutions, in tax incentive and funding legislation to be proposed to Congress, in the allocation of the budget of the national government and through all the multiple channels available to government in the management of the economy. The monetary authorities have already enacted initial measures to encourage exports. It is expected that monetary and financial policy shall further orient assistance towards the tourist and export industries.\r\nThe Philippines intends to be active in international markets. Our trading strategy shall be dictated by the following criteria:\r\nAdmittedly, this plan requires a period of transition: time for manufacturing industries to adjust for competition in international markets; time to build institutions that will support our manufactured exports; and time to develop new markets for our traditional products and new markets for our new export products.\r\nIn this interim, we shall have to seek program loans and we may have to face some uncertainty. But we face these uncertainties with much in our favor. We are currently working at lowering trade barriers between ourselves and the Eastern Socialist countries. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is progressing rapidly towards economic cooperation and integration. We are seeking congressional approval of an omnibus tariff bill, a bill that will enable our industries to compete more vigorously in international markets as well as provide us with the flexibility to enter into tariff agreements to our advantage.\r\nSuccess at exporting manufactured goods is the authentic sign of self-sustaining economy. This is the success that we seek.\r\nWe are growing at a rate which ordinary\r\ntechniques cannot sustain. In moving into the export markets, we enter into competition with developed economies sustained by highly efficient firms. To compete with them, we must not only husband our resources but we must also program them with equal efficiency. This requires true nationalism, discipline, and sacrifice on our part.\r\nThe charge has often been made that government is indifferent to the plight of the poor. This is no longer true. In the years of my first administration, government proved itself a real instrument for social reform. Far from being deaf to the voices of despair and discontent, it has shown compassion for the underprivileged. Far from being insensitive to the clamor for change, it has led a quiet revolution to give justice and abundance to the neglected masses.\r\nIn my second term, government will continue to perform its new role as the ally of the deprived and the unfortunate. It will continue not only to heed the clamor for change but to lead all sectors of society in translating that clamor into real prosperity and contentment among our people. Government, its conscience awakened, will continue to strive for true and enduring social justice. We have narrowed the gap between the rich and the poor. The years ahead will be devoted to further reform and innovation that will destroy class barriers in Filipino society.\r\nAs we enter into our second term, we pledge full commitment to the implementation of the land reform program. We are determined to pursue social justice hand in hand with economic development.\r\nI am aware, as you all are, that economic development is futile and short-lived if it fails to make its benefits felt among the masses of neglected and underprivileged.\r\nWe have therefore inaugurated the Human Resources Development Program. This will increase our people\u2019s capacity to take advantage of opportunities created through development.\r\nThe improvement of our health services has also been a principal program of the administration. The emphasis in this program has been on providing more services to the rural areas, where they are most needed. To date, we have a total of 1,459 rural health units operating throughout the country\u2014an average of one unit serving 24,594 citizens.\r\nIn education, we have confronted the short-run and immediate problems forthrightly and successfully. We had a total of 49,000 elementary school classes added to the public schools system from 1966 to 1969; we produced 90,986 classrooms. This compares favorably with the 800 classrooms produced or constructed from 1962 to 1965, when the total number of new classes was 48,000. Thus, we have favorably solved the problem of accommodation in the schools, which was a principal cause of poor instruction and of a high dropout rate.\r\nThe administration of justice has become more efficient and speedy with the creation of special courts to augment the work of the regular courts. For years, the number of cases filed in court annually had always exceeded the number of cases disposed of. But in 1969, the courts of justice effected a dramatic reversal of this trend.\r\nBut despite the impressive performance of our courts last year, the backlog of cases dating even before 10 years ago continues to be our primary concern.\r\nMore judges are needed. The ideal ratio between judge and population is 1 judge for every 50,000 people; but now this ratio is 1 for every 150,000, truly far from the optimum that a judge could serve effectively.\r\nOur problems in the administration of justice have not, however, deterred us from carrying out a bold and successful peace and order program. This has been possible despite certain abnormal circumstances.\r\nThere are two elements in the peace and order situation in the Philippines. One is simple criminality, which, as the experience of every nation has shown, is conditioned by many social and economic factors. The other element, the state of insurgency obtaining in Central Luzon, is a peculiar Philippine condition.\r\nA close examination of these elements makes only one conclusion possible\u2014that the peace and order condition in the Philippines compares favorably with the rest of the world.\r\nThis comparative stability has been possible despite the heavy pressures of a high rate of population increase. As everyone knows by now, the Philippines has one of the highest rates of population growth in the world. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara once reported that, at its present rate of population increase\u20143.5%\u2014the Philippines is on a par with only one other country in the world, India. Considering the direct proportion between \u201cpopulation explosion,\u201d with its accompanying phenomena like industrialization, urbanization, slums, and various tensions, conflicts, and new social relationships, the Philippines should logically be afflicted today with one of the world\u2019s highest crime rates.\r\nOn the contrary, it has one of the lowest in the world.\r\nTrue enough, the volume of crime in the Philippines has increased\u2014I must add, inevitably\u2014but the crime rate per 100,000 population has decreased. The volume of crime rose by 10.5% over a seven-year period; on the other hand, the crime rate per 100,000 population decreased by 13.4%. What does this mean? It means that although the population has grown tremendously over the years, the Filipino citizen today faces less risk of being victimized in a crime than in the early \u201860s.\r\nThis decrease in crime rate, or decrease in personal risk, was particularly notable between the years 1967 and 1968. In 1968, the third year of my administration, the crime rate fell by 28%, to 150 per 100,000 populations. This was the lowest crime rate since 1959.\r\nWhat makes this record even more significant is that, as I have pointed out, we are also burdened by a condition that is not experienced by other countries. Central Luzon, the traditional seat of social unrest, has contributed heavily to the escalation of crime figures.\r\nAs everybody knows, the murders, homicides, and kidnappings which have resulted from the unrest and dissidence in Central Luzon have been indiscriminately recorded as acts of simple criminality in the statistics of crime, thus considerably increasing the visible signs of public disorder and producing a false picture of peace and order in the country.\r\nIn other words, without the crimes which should properly be distinguished as results of the insurgency in Central Luzon, the crime volume and crime rate in the Philippines would have been even less.\r\nThis has been possible because of the administration\u2019s three major programs against crime, namely: the improvement of our capability for crime prevention, improvement of law enforcement, and improvement of the administration of justice.\r\nAnother reason for the comparatively stable peace and order situation in the Philippines is the improvement in the economic condition, brought about by breakthroughs in food production, infrastructure, and foreign trade. Over the past four years, many of our people have experienced enough improvement in their living conditions to be able to discard the despair of the past and begin to entertain hopes of a good future. This has helped ease the social and private tensions that are often a source of increased criminality.\r\nThe program against crime has had to be carried out with scant resources. For instance, I have been constrained to draw from savings of the executive department to finance the purchase of better police equipment needed by some local governments.\r\nIn this and other creative ways, the administration put to good use the same meager resources that were available to earlier administrations.\r\nIn Central Luzon, the armed threat to the Philippine state continues but is definitely under control. The truly critical areas have been narrowed to about seven municipalities in Pampanga and Tarlac.\r\nWe cannot say that the problem of dissidence can be solved tomorrow or the next week or even a year from now. We delude ourselves in thinking that a final solution by military means can be found. For revolt in any of its forms invariably has a deeper root in the thinking, the aspirations, and the psychology of the group in revolt.\r\nThat is why the government has launched a development program in Central Luzon in which currently about 48 national government agencies are taking part. In the past three years, more than a hundred million pesos has been spent on various development programs in this region; almost the whole region has been placed under land reform.\r\nOur program in Central Luzon is to be pursued patiently and with vigor whether the Huks exist or not. In a sense, it is a proving ground for the proposition that democratic government can be an effective instrument for social change and social justice.\r\nThe military, of course, have their own duty to deal with unbridled violence. Progress can hardly be attained in an atmosphere of constant fear and danger to life and property. Since early last year, we have increased the strength and capability of the PC in Central Luzon. Whereas there were a mere 1,000 in the six provinces of Central Luzon two years ago, there are now or will be, when all the PHILCAG elements are fielded, more than 3,000. It is paradoxical that while the government is actually engaged in putting down an armed threat to the State, we have actually now more troops engaged in development work than we have engaged in combat.\r\nWe are meeting this rebellion with just enough force to cope with open violence and the threat to life and property, not forgetting that the few misguided individuals are part of our people. The programs of development are directed to the welfare of the people as a whole.\r\nThe Armed Forces therefore are engaged in civic and social action\u2014those small-scale, short-term direct help that the military provide in terms of health services and other direct services. PHILCAG will engage in long-term construction and improvement of facilities and communications. They will reinforce the civilian agencies in the Central Luzon Development Program that are engaged in social and economic uplift on the principle of self-help, self-determination, and social cooperation.\r\nIt is in this spirit, too, that now we are undertaking the military actions against actual violence with the closer and more active participation of the mass of the people. I refer to the new concept of the barrio home defense, as recommended by the field officers engaged in Central Luzon.\r\nIt has been said that a people get the government they deserve. By the same token, the peace and order that a locality will get is what the people in that locality strive and work for. Recent developments in Central Luzon indicate that the people in those beleaguered provinces have become so fed up with dissident threats and violence that they have volunteered to take on the fight themselves with, of course, the active help and support of our regular forces.\r\nIn Pampanga, almost all the mayors are committed to the program; in southern Tarlac where the \u201cMa-Mao\u201d is active in three towns including part of the capital, the mayors and rural leaders have become so involved in the program that as a result, the so-called New People\u2019s Army had to take stem countermeasures against the very people they were ostensibly protecting from abuses of the government, by an orgy of killings and indiscriminate armed attacks. Not against combat troops, but against the defenseless barrio people.\r\nThe First PC Zone reports that there are 50 barrios that have fully organized their barrio home defense forces, and many more barrios are being organized. Eventually about 400 barrios will be organized in the provinces of Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Bataan. A barrio home defense unit is composed of 10 male volunteers from the barrio under the close supervision of a five-man control and training team of the military. Its mission is to protect the barrio from dissident depredation, threat, and exploitation, and to deny to the enemy the resources in food, money, shelter, and other forms of support that he could get if the barrio were defenseless and afraid.\r\nThere are some who have voiced reasonable fears about the concept. Not a few, for example, believe that we have merely revived the once despised civilian guards. Others fear that the home defense forces might conceivably be used by local political leaders for their own ends. To these well-meaning doubters, it may be explained that the barrio home defense unit consists of volunteers from within the barrio. They are trained and closely supervised by responsible noncommissioned officers of the PC or Army. These volunteers are not going to be controlled by any local politician, big or small; their arms are secured in storage in the military detachment when they are not on duty; and none of the volunteers will be employed in any mission outside their barrio except when actually defending a nearby barrio under direct armed attack.\r\nCommunity development retained its high priority in the programs of the administration for 1969. Through the Presidential Arm on Community Development, we continued to make progress in our rural communities in terms of physical and social improvements, increased economic viability, and political maturity among the rural folk. This was done through the channeling of more resources to the community development program and an intensified campaign to involve the barrio folk in the work of developing their communities.\r\nThrough the Commission on National Integration and the Presidential Assistant on National Minorities (PANAMIN), we have reclaimed thousands from a life of backwardness and deprivation and brought them into the stream of national progress.\r\nThe acceleration of the housing program has been a major concern of my first administration. I propose to redouble the pace of construction and resettlement in my second term. Economic development will be meaningless unless low-cost housing is made possible for the bulk of the population in urban as well as in rural areas.\r\nAs another means of enriching the life of our people, this administration recognizes the indispensable role of science and technology in national development. Through the National Science Development Board, the government is determined to develop the country\u2019s resources and to apply these resources to the acceleration of the economic, social, and cultural progress of the country.\r\nLet us examine more closely the individual fields of activity through which the government has sought, and will continue to seek, social reform and develop our human resources.\r\nI have already said, the emphasis of our health program has been to provide more services to the rural areas, where a good number of the people, as surveys have shown, have never seen a doctor in all their lives.\r\nWith the present high growth rate of the population, we should have more rural health units in our efforts to implement fully Republic Act 3797, entitled \u201cAn Act Strengthening Health and Dental Services in the Rural Areas.\u201d\r\nWe plan to intensify surveillance and investigation of disease problems, especially with reference to the acute communicable diseases, which have remained as the major disease problem. We also intend to continue with the special control programs, with the assistance of international agencies, on such diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, cholera el tor, leprosy, cancer, and malnutrition.\r\nIn the last four years, this administration provided the impetus for the operation of the Food and Drug Administration, established in 1963, to insure a safe and good-quality supply of food, drugs, and cosmetics, and to regulate their production, sale, and distribution. We will continue to protect the public against unsafe food and fake drugs and cosmetics.\r\nMore efforts will be exerted on the general improvement of the environment especially with regard to the provision of potable water supply and sanitary methods of waste disposal. The health education of the masses as an important element of disease prevention and control will be similarly intensified.\r\nTo improve dental services, I propose to Congress the passage of pending bills seeking to amend Republic Act No. 951 relative to the provision for school dental services in private educational institutions, and to regulate the operation and maintenance of dental laboratories.\r\nOur government hospitals, which are performing heroic tasks in the face of inadequate facilities, must be provided with more funds to enable them to keep up with the increasing demand for their services.\r\nThe Philippine General Hospital, originally created as a training hospital for the UP College of Medicine, is one such government hospital that has been forced to operate beyond its normal capacity. As a vital link in the administration\u2019s program to serve the hospital needs of the people, it deserves more support from the national government.\r\nI have pointed out that in 1969, the courts of justice disposed of more cases than were filed, thus reversing a trend that had existed for years.\r\nCourts of First Instance nationwide scored a disposal ratio above 105%. Municipal courts averaged 102%. City courts also reached above 102%. In Manila, where crime density is highest, the Courts of First Instance averaged over 120%. And all the circuit criminal courts, fully operative only this year, lived up fully to public trust by dispensing impartial justice promptly. The Manila Circuit Criminal Court, for example, disposed of 483 cases out of 623 filed during the year.\r\nThe special courts matched the impressive performance of the regular courts. Their disposal ratios for 1969 are 105% in the Court of Agrarian Relations, 101% in the Court of Industrial Relations, and 129% in the Court of Tax Appeals. Of 45 tax court decisions appealed to the Supreme Court, 43 were affirmed and one merely modified, while one was reversed.\r\nThis performance of the judiciary is best reflected in the fact that at the end of last year, fewer cases were pending in court: only 81,239 as of the year-end compared to 85,341 in 1968.\r\nWe implemented promptly the 1969 social justice legislation intended to benefit the less privileged sector of society. No doubt these measures will promote access to the courts and insure equality before the law. Indigent litigants and their witnesses now receive travel and other allowances for attending court. Free transcripts of stenographic notes are furnished to indigent or low-income parties in judicial and nonjudicial proceedings. Bail requirements are now dispensed with in cases involving minor criminal offenses or city and municipal ordinances. And where indigent persons are victims or accused, the criminal cases are given preference over others to expedite their disposition.\r\nSubstantive and procedural reforms continue to be our concern. We are now implementing the equalization of caseload among municipal courts as well as providing further assistance to overburdened CFI salas.\r\nEven more significant, the Department of Justice has installed a computer program exclusively for criminal cases. It is now possible to tell promptly the stage which a particular case has reached, from filing to conviction or acquittal. In a matter of minutes, the judge\u2019s performance record on criminal cases can be reliably retrieved. Undue delay is therefore checked promptly. And our court administrators can now pinpoint and correct defects, if any, in the criminal justice process.\r\nThrough the fiscal\u2019s offices and the prosecution staff, we have intensified the administration\u2019s campaign against criminality. This campaign has netted 10,981 convictions. Through the Bureau of Immigration, we caused the deportation of the notorious corruptor, Ernesto Ting, and 283 other undesirable aliens. Illegal entrants, dummies, syndicate operators, smugglers, and other aliens violating our laws have been apprehended and punished.\r\nThe relentless campaign against graft and corruption to maintain the people\u2019s faith in government continues. Those executive officials, judges, prosecutors, fiscals, and other national officials accused of wrongdoing have been investigated, and those guilty held accountable. It secured, for example, the conviction of a suburban mayor in the traffic reflectors case, now on appeal. For cause, 14 judges have been suspended, removed, or dismissed, bringing to a total of 30 the judges found erring since 1966.\r\nFor the first time, the Philippine Government, through the department, has asserted its right to exercise criminal jurisdiction over criminal offenses in military bases and those committed elsewhere by U.S. military personnel and civilian components where those cases are beyond the competence of courts martial under U.S. law. Henceforth, Philippine courts and fiscals offices will take cognizance of such cases.\r\nWe pursued a plan for the decongestion of the national penitentiary. At the same time, we have successfully started the self-sufficiency in food program for the Bureau of Prisons. Penal colonies in Sablayan, Davao, and Iwahig have reported successful food projects. Prison industries now include shoe and slipper-making, handicraft, carpentry, plywood and hollow blocks production, and electronics. Our objective is to make our prisons truly a school for productive citizenship and moral reform.\r\nWhile 112 new CFI salas have been created by law in 1969, they now require organizing, funding, and staffing if they are to be operative soon. More circuit criminal courts are needed, with expanded criminal jurisdiction, to help further decongest the clogged dockets of regular courts.\r\nAn objective analysis will show that while demands for their services have rapidly expanded, there had been no systematic or commensurate support in terms of men, money, and material for our justice agencies. Consistently, the Department of Justice has received less than 2.5% of the national budget. As new duties are laid on the department, its material requirements also increase and must be met if it must fulfill its tasks successfully.\r\nThe workload of the Office of the Solicitor General has more than doubled since more courts have been created and more cases appealed. But there has been no corresponding increase in its personnel. The Courts of Agrarian Relations, which are involved in land reform, urgently need competent special field attorneys. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts in Manila, Quezon City, and Iloilo require social workers and technical men, which, at present, they just borrow from other offices. The Court of Industrial Relations must have a striking force capable of responding to urgent cases at places of labor unrest. The Bureau of Prisons needs expert services in psychiatry and psychology for certain inmates. The per capita subsistence allowance for prison inmates is only P0.70, an unrealistic amount. The Deportation Board has no sala or hearing room, nor personnel of its own; its clerical staff is borrowed from different offices. Almost all regular courts, special courts, and fiscals\u2019 offices require minimal library facilities and research material to speed up their disposition of cases. Moreover, certain judges have had no salas of their own nor adequate security and other facilities. The Board of Pardons and Parole has 19,516 released prisoners under its surveillance spread nationwide, but its limited manpower cannot cope with them. Our prisons are so congested that there had been a recurrence of serious disturbances commonly called riots so that now the dispersal of prisoners, particularly gang members, is imperative.\r\nLooking ahead, always with a view to safeguarding judicial independence and upgrading court performance, we propose strict adherence to the criteria for the wise and careful selection of nominees to the judiciary. These criteria necessarily include moral courage, ethical firmness, and imperviousness to venal influence. A nominee\u2019s judicial temperament must be augmented by decisiveness, capacity for hard work, good health, and zeal for public service. His education, training, association, and experience must show he is eminently qualified to hold a judicial office.\r\nTo insure that never again will judicial output of disposed cases fall below par, we will maintain closer supervision of the operations of our courts. Certificates of work accomplished will be scrutinized, and in case of any falsification, prompt action will be taken. No judge will be promoted or transferred if his sala has a heavy backlog of cases. Performance of judges due for retirement or wishes to resign will be assessed so that none will leave unless all cases already submitted for decision are disposed of within a reasonable time. Only those employees, particularly stenographers, whose performance is beyond reproach will be considered for advancement.\r\nWhile observing retrenchment measures to promote austerity and economy in the public service, we will also focus on revenue-producing functions of the department. Increased earnings for the government will be stressed through intensified, prompt, and proper collections of fees and dues. Promotion of tourism and investments will be supported through appropriate bureaus like the Bureau of Immigration. The police agencies, the fiscals\u2019 offices, and the courts will render prompt assistance to our visitors who are victims of crime and other offenses. At the same time, we will press for the implementation of laws designed to enhance law and order as well as reforms, such as the expropriation and redistribution of landed estates, to promote our economic development and social justice.\r\nBesides an accelerated school-building program, we have taken measures which simultaneously respond to pressing problems and pave the way for long-range improvements in education. Under R.A. 5447, otherwise known as the Special Education Fund Law, local governments retain shares of real property tax proceeds which are budgeted by local school boards to finance local educational improvements. Additional improvements are financed by a national stabilization fund. The local school boards all over the country provide a mechanism for improving education, for making education relevant to local circumstances, and for involving the local communities in a national task.\r\nWe have increased the general fund support for state colleges and universities by 30%, the highest in our history.\r\nWe have organized a fund for assistance to private education, which provides grants, loans, and other aid to improve the facilities and raise the quality of instruction and research in our private higher education institutions.\r\nWe have, for the first time in our history, organized an education planning office to rationalize the management of our educational system by developing a systems approach to education and thereby relating it to our needs and resources.\r\nMeantime, the President\u2019s Educational Survey Commission has been organized. This commission will recommend ways and means to research our broad human resources development goals, to relate educational operations to manpower requirements, to channel national resources to strategic educational projects, to promote development-oriented values in our schools, and to improve the management and structure of the entire educational system.\r\nSuch recommendations of the commission as are adopted will be implemented partly through external financing, for which the preliminary steps have already been undertaken.\r\nThe task ahead in education is one of creative transformation, the clearing away of outworn attitudes and behaviors, and the utilization of our investment in learning and training to the optimum, in order that our educational system shall become a beneficial and enlightened partnership between our generation and that of the young Filipinos, in whose behalf we labor and spend.\r\nOne of the principal projects in our educational reform program is the establishment of more trade schools. The beginnings of industrialization in almost all countries are the small machine shops and workshops. Unless we train the young in trade schools in coordination with the manpower development training program, we will not be able to encourage the growth of small machine shops and workshops in this country.\r\nThe past four years were a time of significant gains for the Filipino worker.\r\nWe raised the level of trade unionism. We registered 1,771 new labor unions, extending protection and the benefits of trade unionism to about 100,000 more workers.\r\nIndustrial peace was enhanced. We cut down the incidence of strikes by 67% compared with the average during the previous administration.\r\nWe upgraded the enforcement of labor and social laws. Increased attention was given to the protection of migrant workers, domestic help, and other unorganized and underprivileged workers. These initial efforts will be accelerated in 1970.\r\nWe gave the country its first workable manpower development program. In less than two years, some 100,000 out-of-school youth and jobless young adults learned valuable skills in some 186 training centers throughout the country. The majority of these trainees have found employment or have otherwise become self-employed.\r\nJob opportunities in the last four years increased by 220% to an annual average of 647,000. Rural employment soared to a record annual average of 453,000.\r\nFor the first time in over 20 years, we succeeded in concluding two base labor agreements with the United States government, improving the working and living conditions of about 75,000 Filipino workers employed in U.S. military bases in the Philippines and abroad.\r\nSome of the most enlightened labor legislations and policies in our country were carried out during the previous administration. These include the Medicare Act, the Manpower and Youth Development Act, the vigorous implementation of land reform, and mass housing for workers.\r\nWe have become a major voice in Asian labor affairs and have strengthened our bonds with the International Labor Organization. As a consequence, we shall establish before the end of the year a NationalSkillsTrainingCenter. An ILO area office has been established in Manila.\r\nCorollary to manpower development, we have given new emphasis to manpower conservation. The promotion of industrial health and safety is now one of the major features of our labor program.\r\nThe unification of labor has found support in recent years. We shall encourage and support any move to unify our working classes.\r\nLabor has also enjoyed the widest freedom of expression under our administration. Labor shall increasingly be heard and represented in the major policy-making councils of government.\r\nThe social welfare program of the government gained greater scope and new impetus during the year 1969. Under the aegis of the Department of Social Welfare and the First Lady\u2019s Integrated Social Welfare Program, new projects were launched with the full backing of government and the private sector.\r\nThough less than a year old at the start of 1969, the Department of Social Welfare was able to launch an expanded program designed to improve the lot of our underprivileged. The government budget for FY 1969-1970 provided P16,135,000 for social welfare, the biggest sum yet allocated for social welfare.\r\nIn its basic objective, the government\u2019s social welfare program remained the same. We sought to provide more and better opportunities for advancement among the underprivileged Filipinos so that they could rise above their submarginal existence, economically and socially.\r\nWhat was new in the department\u2019s operations in 1969 was the veering way from the traditional form of help such as relief and institutional care to a concerted development among welfare clients of the capacity for self-determination, independence, and self-respect. To this basic reorientation, there was complementary success in the establishment of modern and improved facilities for the program; the recruitment and training of skilled manpower for social work; and the participation of local governments in welfare projects. In this manner, the government was able to intensify its welfare services and reached a new group of people whose continued existence without the benefit of these social services threaten the peace and security of our society. These developments significantly contributed to the building of a new image for the government\u2019s social welfare program and agencies.\r\nThe activities of the Department of Social Welfare during the past year may be classified under three main areas of interest: family welfare services, child and youth welfare services, and vocational rehabilitation.\r\nFamily welfare services consisted of direct financial and material aid to families in distress, education and counseling, community services, economic advancement, and substitute home placement. Financial aid to needy families consisted of P100 a month per family, and this aid was extended to a total number of 931 families during the past year. A general assistance fund was also set up for the extension of limited financial and material help to other needy families. Under this fund, 10,480 families were served in 1969. Under family life education and counseling, 192 families were served. Under community services, which consisted of organization activities outside or inside community service center, there are now five community centers in operation serving an estimated total of 10,000 families. Under economic advancement services, 3,481 income-producing projects were organized and assisted.\r\nChild and youth welfare services were intensified through the expanded operation of existing government institutions and the creation of new projects. The Elsie Gaches Village was expanded to become the National Center for Disabled Children, and this was complemented by the establishment of the Nayon ng Kabataan and by the department\u2019s assistance to various boys\u2019 institutions all over the country.\r\nBesides serving children with special needs, the Child and Youth Welfare Program sought the enhancement of opportunities for homeless children, delinquent minors, special youth groups, and children in the rural areas. Under this part of the program, the total number of persons served is estimated at around 10,000 children during the last year.\r\nThe vocational rehabilitation program was expanded in 1969 to reach a new group of clients, such as released prisoners, recovered drug addicts, recovered alcoholics, and negative hansenites in addition to the blind, the deaf-mute, and the lame. A guidance clinic program is being developed for the benefit of this special group of clients in addition to existing services which may also be dispensed to them as found necessary. A rehabilitation guidance clinic has been established and is at present initially serving about 100 clients.\r\nThe social welfare work of the DSW was supplemented considerably by the First Lady\u2019s Integrated Social Welfare Program. Begun in 1967, the program sought to drum up private and government support for welfare projects beyond the reach of government agencies. Working under a system of priorities, the program began with child and youth welfare and later expanded its scope to include welfare of the aged. Projects begun in 1968 were completed in 1969, and among these were the Nayon ng Kabataan at the Manila International Airport, the Molave Village in Tanay, Rizal, and the Marillac Hills project for girls. In 1969, too, the Integrated Social Welfare Program was able to complete the new home for the aged.\r\nIt cannot, of course, be claimed that we have fully answered the social needs of our community. Many of our people have not been reached by our welfare programs, and those who are need more care and guidance than we are able to muster at the moment. But whereas in earlier years our social welfare program was taken cynically as synonymous with hopelessness and failure, today it is looked on by a considerable segment of our people as the promise of a new life.\r\nThat promise we are resolved to fulfill.\r\nThe scope of leasehold operations has increased from 12 municipalities in 1966, involving 15,691 palay farmers working in an area of 38,473 hectares, to 142 municipalities involving 180,674 palay farmers working a total area of 422,517 hectares. Share tenants benefited totaled 118,407 with a loan volume under the supervised credit program equivalent to P24.9 million. Palay production in land reform areas increased from 49 to 61.5 cavans for the first crop and from 41 to 64 cavans for the second crop.\r\nSide-by-side with the operations in leasehold areas was the effort to upgrade land settlement projects in Bukidnon, Lanao, Cotabato, and Palawan. Rehabilitation work as well as initial effort to transform hostile wilderness into livable and dynamic communities were undertaken. The Land Authority has coordinated with other government agencies in the relocation of families in favor of the release of the area for the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market and the Quezon City National Park.\r\nDuring the last four years, the Land Authority has issued 5,000 deeds of sale, 349 agreements to sell, and 7,109 orders of award. The issuance of land patents, a function now transferred to the Land Authority from the Bureau of Lands, was also given greater impetus, which in one year of operation issued 1,400 patents against 475 issued by the Bureau of Lands in a four-year period.\r\nAerial photogrammetry has been undertaken by the Land Authority in collaboration with some government agencies and a private firm. An aggregate area of 13 million hectares in Central Luzon, Panay Island, Mindanao, and Palawan has been completely photographed. The importance of aerial photogrammetry has been recognized not only for the purpose of land reform but also for regional socioeconomic planning,\r\nDuring our first term, the Land Bank became fully operational. Up to November 1969, it has financed the acquisition of 10 agricultural estates covering an aggregate total of 997,614.5 hectares benefiting 363 farm lessees at a cost of P3,375,900.00. Deeds of sale now pending approval with the Court of Agrarian Relations involved nine agricultural estates, an area of 1,108,178 hectares, benefiting 252 farmer lessees and a cost of P3,821,400.00. To these we have to include the Hacienda Noble Jose in Pangasinan, an area of 1,058 hectares which cost the government P3.7 million. Hacienda El Porvenir, also in Pangasinan, faces final settlement as to just compensation. Two other estates, Mayapak Estate in Mindoro covering an area of 1,248.5 hectares and La Pe\u00f1a Estate in Pampanga with an area of 32 hectares, were acquired and paid for in negotiable land certificates in the amounts of P2.8 million and P112,203, respectively.\r\nThe Land Bank has assisted 509 agricultural lessees in redemption cases. An actual consignment of P858,836.00 was made with the Court of Agrarian Relations.\r\nTwenty-one estates to be acquired are under registration and 172 agricultural estates have been referred for investigation by the field units of the Land Reform Project Administration.\r\nDuring the last session of Congress, I certified a bill authorizing the sale of military camps situated around Manila and suburbs to generate more funds for the Land Bank. Unfortunately, it did not pass. I reiterate its importance here and ask anew that it be passed this year.\r\nThe land reform manpower and personnel development aspects have been reinforced by the establishment of an Agrarian Reform Institute at the University of the Philippines. The institute shall serve as a repository of research materials, studies, and reports. It shall supplement existing training programs for land reform by offering an academic program for higher specialization and for the professionalization of the agrarian reform bureaucracy.\r\nAgrarian reform must be implemented by a single organization. It is, therefore, important that the present land reform agencies should be reorganized and placed under a single line and comprehensive department. This will insure a simpler, more efficient and economical program planning and implementation.\r\nWe intend, within the next four years, to place the entire country under leasehold, thereby completely terminating the share-crop tenancy system. We must look for ways and means, amending the code if necessary, to hasten the implementation of land reform by simplifying prescribed procedures in preparing areas for leasehold proclamation. One method will be to expedite the land capability and classification survey so as to determine feasible lease rentals based on land capability.\r\nWe shall embark on a larger land acquisition program under the Land Authority and the Land Bank in order that the establishment of family-owned farms can be realized. To encourage the landowners to offer their landholdings for sale, it is necessary to increase the ceiling of cash payment from its present level.\r\nThere is need for legislation to permit the Land Bank to determine the interest rates of the bonds and to widen and enlarge their uses.\r\nIn terms of technical services and financial assistance, the PACD during the period 1966-1969 stimulated implemented a total of 118,883 community projects, worth P212,146,738.56, with the PACD contributing P175,262,631.04. These projects are demonstrative in nature and commonly serve as stopgaps for the socioeconomic ills of communities. Mainly, they are for increased production and income, public improvements, improved health and sanitation, and for cultural and recreation purposes. All in all, they benefited 31,968 barrios with a combined population of some 30,000,000 people.\r\nIn terms of government-sponsored self-help projects, our rural communities, with the aid of local governments and private institutions, implemented a total of 203,260 self-help project worth P59,477,323.63 in terms of cash, materials, labor, and project sites. The degree of participation on the part of the private sector is evident from the fact that for every peso spent by the government, the beneficiaries contributed P2.69\r\nFinally, in the training of the barrio folk development work during the four-year period under review, we were able to organize and finish 177,006 training and information projects involving 13,141,172 participants with a total cost of P24,073,123.94. Of this amount, the government shouldered P800,378.29, or less than three-and-a-half percent of the total cost; the substantial part of the fund was borne by the barrio folk.\r\nAll this is evidence of the success of our community development program. This further reinforces our belief that our total socioeconomic program for the nation should be complemented by a program to develop our communities, such as we have done during the past four years.\r\nAfter a dozen years of existence, the Commission on National Integration can look back with pride on its accomplishments.\r\nParticularly during the past four years under an enlightened administration, the CNI has brought about the gradual uplift of the more than 47 known ethnic groups, from the Apayaos in the north to the Badjaos in the south.\r\nThis uplift has been brought about through education, legal assistance, social and administrative aid, settlement aids, and accelerated research and public information programs.\r\nIn 1969, the CNI\u2019s scholar program reached a new high. A record P3.5 million was appropriated for scholarships to deserving members of the cultural minorities throughout the islands.\r\nThe new scholarship policy is in line with the administration\u2019s socioeconomic goals. More emphasis was laid on technical-vocational courses.\r\nIn the legal field, the CNI\u2019s lawyers answered the call particularly of the impoverished minorities. CNI legal personnel went to different parts of the country to handle landgrabbing cases for the minorities and prepared the ground for the proclamation of reserved areas as cultural minorities\u2019 settlements.\r\nTo enable cultural minority provinces and municipalities to improve their services for the minorities, this year the CNI released a total of P100,000.00 for social development and P62,500.00 as administrative aid.\r\nSeven settlements were in actual operation in 1969. A skeleton force of fieldsmen in six regional offices looked after the minorities\u2019 needs in the rural areas. Basic farm assistance was given to settlers including the assignment of a farm manager to each settlement.\r\nOn August 10, 1967, this administration created the office of the Presidential Assistant on National Minorities (PANAMIN). The PANAMIN has been an extremely successful attempt by the government to focus attention on the problems of our more than four million Filipinos who belong to the national cultural minorities, and to involve actively the private sector in model programs of medical, social, and economic assistance. PANAMIN\u2019s unique organization, which combines both the support of the government and private sectors in programs to accelerate development of our minority people, has received national acclaim\u2014the word PANAMIN providing hope for millions of our fellow citizens. In addition to the occasional services extended to it by other existing agencies of the government, PANAMIN has received a budget from the government of P1,000,000 in cash and in kind. The private sector has contributed an even larger share. The major achievements of PANAMIN during its brief existence are as follows:\r\nUrbanization is a concomitant of modernization. Correctly viewed, urban areas constitute a spearhead of economic and social development.\r\nIn some cases, however, unplanned growth has resulted in the creeping disease of urban blight. Cities outgrow themselves without realizing it. Inadequate sanitation facilities, shortage of social services, lack of housing resulting in the growth of slums, excessive speculation in land, lack of public transportation coupled with inadequate streets, pollution of the atmosphere\u2014these are some of the symptoms of the progressive disease known as urban blight.\r\nPart of this is due to great population pressure brought about by internal migration. In turn, the migration pattern is set by the undue economic expectations raised by the cities.\r\nThe problem is how to maintain the economic viability of the urban areas while averting blight. For blight is not merely a physical condition; it gives birth to social disorders arising from the failure to satisfy the basic needs of the poor.\r\nTraditionally, the solution is decentralization of industries, the creation of other centers as magnets for internal migrants. This, I propose to do. Studies are in progress for the establishment of industrial estates which will form the nuclei of new urban areas.\r\nSuch a solution takes time, however; in the meantime, the urgent need is for the provision of housing, alternatively, the relocation of squatters. The success of the Sapang Palay experiment indicates that relocation, when undertaken in a suitable area and when accompanied by a program of community development, offers a practical solution.\r\nFor a variety of reasons, however, low-cost housing in urban areas is a more attractive proposition. In 1966, I ordered a thorough study of the housing needs of the country. This resulted in the establishment of the National Housing Corporation, which began operations last year.\r\nThe NHC is a pioneering project but its very success emphasizes the dimension of the housing problem of the country. The majority of Filipino families belong to the low- and middle-income groups. The housing needs of the country are estimated at 470,000 units annually for the next 20 years. As against this estimate, the NHC can build only 12,000 units per year. In time, the corporation expects to increase its output but nowhere near the amount needed to absorb all the estimated housing needs.\r\nIt is clear that other avenues must be explored to solve a problem of increasing urgency. I propose to tap other resources to augment the efforts of the NHC, but in the long run, I believe that private enterprise should help and recognize the housing problem not only as an investment challenge but as a challenge in civic awareness.\r\nTo finance scientific research on a sustained basis in the next five years, funds are generated from the science documentary stamps and the additional private motor vehicle tax. Research institutions, both private and government, receive support from the funds. In the last four years, a total of 112 research projects were undertaken, extensive surveys of Filipino scientific and technological manpower, a compilation of research and development activities in the Philippines, a compilation of current and past researches on water, fishery, geothermal power, petroleum, gas, and nuclear raw material resources.\r\nOur science development program emphasizes the upgrading of science teachers, the improvement of science curricula, the provision on teaching equipment, the modernization of laboratory facilities and research in science teaching. Under the teacher-training institutes, a total of 2,354 were trained. We also obtained 100 Leybold Physics equipment through the German technical assistance for the use of the Philippine science high schools.\r\nThree agencies\u2014the Philippine Coconut Research Institute, the Philippine Textile Research Institute, and the Philippine Inventors Commission\u2014were added to the NSDB.\r\nThe Philippine Coconut Research Institute is the first step towards the modernization of the coconut industry now facing problems in research and production, processing, marketing, fertilizers and pesticides, training and organization of farmers\u2019 cooperatives, and financing.\r\nThe Philippine Textile Research Institute was established by the NSDB in January, 1967, in recognition of the sad plight of the local textile industry. Under Republic Act 4086, textile millers are given tax exemptions for the importation of raw materials, chemicals, and spare parts for equipment. In lieu of taxes and duties, the textile millers pay 1% of their gross sales, which becomes part of the Special Textile Research Fund.\r\nWe reactivated the Philippine Inventors Commission on May 8, 1967, to encourage local inventors develop machines useful for our economic development. We plan to establish creative societies in our schools to promote inventiveness among the youth.\r\nThe uses of atomic energy for economic development will continue to be explored by the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission of the NSDB. During the last four years, a total of 57 research projects were completed in the following fields: agriculture, biology, medicine, engineering and industry, and the physical sciences. We have also assisted 107 institutions in launching or undertaking nuclear energy work. Seventy-six scientists were sent abroad to study nuclear science and technology; and 482 scientists, medical doctors, engineers, and technicians were provided basic training in the use of nuclear techniques through the commission\u2019s local training courses.\r\nThese are the gains and expectations. With the new competence and the new faith in ourselves that have developed through the past four years, we cannot fail.\r\nIndeed, we cannot afford to fail. For we are faced with a grave and persistent problem which, unsolved, will wipe out all our gains and destroy the promise of abundance and stability. This is the population problem.\r\nWe are faced by a population crisis. It is time that we became aware of it. Much more important, it is time that we began to take steps to arrest a population growth which, unless checked, threatens to compound our problems in the years ahead.\r\nThe Philippines has an average population of 3.5%, one of the highest in the world. At that rate, the present population estimated at 37 million will have increased to 45 million in 1975\u2014just five years from today\u2014and to 53 million by the end of the decade.\r\nThere is nothing inherently wrong in rapid population growth. The problem is to increase the rate of national growth over and above population growth. But to suppose that this can easily be done is, to be frank, a dangerous illusion.\r\nThis emphasizes the importance of measures\r\nfor the control of population.\r\nWith a soaring birth rate, the prospects for a continued economic development are considerably diminished. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the gains which we have carefully built up over the years may be cancelled by a continuing population explosion.\r\nAssuming that there will be no decline in the birth rate, the critical areas will be the supply of food, employment, and education. Just to maintain present standards, the Philippines will need, during the decade, a 40% increase in food production and similar percentage increases in schools and job opportunities.\r\nThe financial outlay required for these heavy investments, not to speak of equally heavy investments in expanded social and allied services, will inevitably eat away the total capital needed for development.\r\nI do not share the doomsday accent of the prophets of disaster, but I cannot anticipate this prospect with equanimity. My first act therefore after the elections was to convene a council on population to prepare studies on which population policy can be based.\r\nAfter a careful weighing of factors, I have decided to propose legislation making family planning an official policy of my administration.\r\nThe task of government in the control of population is threefold.\r\nThe first is education, in order to impress on the people the urgent need for controlling the population.\r\nThe second is the dissemination of knowledge on the techniques of birth control sanctioned by scientific and medical practice.\r\nThe third is the provision of facilities, especially in the rural areas, where assistance in the use of birth control methods may be extended to the poor.\r\nThese will be included in the proposed\r\nfamily planning law.\r\nI am aware of the important role of private initiative in spreading knowledge about family planning. In particular, the mass media have been extremely helpful in pointing out the dangers of the population explosion. I urge them to continue to do so.\r\nThe meaning of the population explosion is human misery\u2014a deprivation of the basic necessities for sheer physical survival. This is the rightful concern of the Church, for above all else, it is committed to man as man; anything that diminishes him diminishes all humanity.\r\nI therefore invite the Church to join in a common enterprise to alleviate suffering\u2014to help, just as its sister Churches have helped in many lands where the population explosion is a persistent, an urgent, and above all an intensely human problem.\r\nPolitically, we have achieved several \u201cfirsts.\u201d\r\nFor the first time, we reelected an incumbent president. We thus shed the wasteful habit of trusting in palliatives in favor of long-range planning and steady, disciplined implementation.\r\nWe have geared our foreign policy to the day when we will have to look after our own national security. We have shown that we are politically mature and diplomatically responsible. We have not allowed our differences with Malaysia on Sabah to hamper the more important goal of unifying our part of Southeast Asia for mutual growth and security.\r\nFrom foreign and trade relations exclusively with \u201csafe\u201d countries, we are moving towards cultural, economic, and diplomatic ties with countries of diverse political persuasions.\r\nThe keynote of our foreign policy is self-reliance and independence; the method, flexibility in the pursuit of national objectives; the watch word, nationalism.\r\nForeign policy does not operate in a vacuum. It operates in a world which resounds with the clash of national interest. For the Philippines, as for any other nation, the objective is to discover among a diversity of purposes a community of interest with other countries which can be pursued for the common benefit.\r\nThus the need for flexibility. As overdependence on any one country restricts freedom of action, so in reverse does a widening of relations in the international field open a whole new world of opportunities.\r\nThis reorientation is, first of all, a recognition of the changed character of the world in which we live, and secondly, a response to the increasingly nationalistic aspirations of the Filipino people.\r\nForeign policy in previous years had, perhaps unavoidably, marked colonial characteristics. It had ceased to be a useful tool for enhancing the national interest. The new requirements of the Filipino people brought about by changing conditions here and abroad made it imperative that we reexamine outmoded assumptions. Accordingly, I directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to undertake a study in scale for redirecting the main thrusts of our foreign policy and to prepare the means, by which a new forward-looking foreign policy could be implemented.\r\nThe burden of the new foreign policy is as follows:\r\nDevelopments in the past year in the international scene have in the main been hopeful. Although the Cold War has not been entirely eliminated, it is largely residual in character, permitting a change in emphasis from unproductive pursuits to the study of problems having to do with the growth and development of individual countries, especially the developing countries.\r\nWhile the menace of nuclear war has receded to a certain degree, the problems which have replaced it are equally urgent. Not less than total and annihilating war, the issues revolve and touch upon the ability to survive the perils of the Third World, of which the Philippines is a part.\r\nThe threat of escalating poverty in three-quarters of the world, the mounting population pressure, the overincreasing disparity between the rich and the relatively poor countries\u2014the ramifying problems draw upon our reserves of will and purpose in order to survive and, hopefully, to flourish in the critical seventies. The desire and willingness for political accommodations must be matched by a similar desire and willingness for economic accommodations.\r\nThese problems cannot be solved by individual countries; they must be solved in common. To this task, we, friends and foes alike, must address ourselves.\r\nIn our region of the world, there have been two encouraging developments. The first is the de-escalation of the Vietnam War, and the second is the emergence of the ASEAN as a positive factor in the enhancement of regional cooperation in Southeast Asia.\r\nRegarding Vietnam, we are still in the proverbial tunnel. But the de-escalation has at the very least a symbolic value, namely, that a will exists to find the means for ending a fruitless war which has sharpened political divisions all over the world and added needless strain on the precarious stability of Southeast Asia. We continue to hope for the best while being prepared at all times to contribute to the further easing of tensions which could lead to the ending of the war.\r\nLast December, I ordered the PHILCAG home after humanitarian service in Vietnam. Its record is unstained; its reputation amongst the people it helped at the highest. I recalled the PHILCAG because the funds for its maintenance have run out and because it is needed for similar humanitarian service in Central Luzon. Unfortunately, its return was marred by a controversy which imputed unworthy motives to our government.\r\nI repeat that the PHILCAG went to Vietnam for no other reason than the desire to help a friendly people in distress. Under normal circumstances, the PHILCAG\u2019s assistance would have been viewed with gratitude. But we seem to have been caught in the midst of a bitter internal debate, a bystander dragged into the dirt by combatants too intent on winning a verbal brawl to notice that innocent parties have been hurt.\r\nBut I, and still less the PHILCAG, do not ask for the gratitude of the United States Congress or of certain senators. It is enough that peasants in the hills of Vietnam looked upon the PHILCAG as a friendly presence, as a helping hand extended in a time of need.\r\nThe last ministerial meeting of the ASEAN should be regarded as a breakthrough stage in the short life of the ASEAN. For the first time since its founding, a map of wide-ranging though modest projects has been drawn. Depending on our capability to implement them, the succeeding years will indicate whether Southeast Asia is at last ready for the novel experiment of regional cooperation. All the signs are hopeful and we feel it must succeed.\r\nThe projected withdrawal of the United Kingdom from Southeast Asia coupled with the announced policy of United States military retrenchment in the region after the Vietnam War have added a new dimension to the ASEAN. Interest has been expressed in certain quarters about the possibility of using the ASEAN as the nucleus of a possible indigenous security system.\r\nSuch a plan is quite clearly not feasible at this stage. At the same time we should be receptive, while remaining uncommitted, to the merits of a regional security system committed to the defense of the region. Clearly, such a defense system will have limited objectives, and the basis of cooperation may not even be military in the sense that it is usually understood. The necessary task of clarification of objectives, capabilities, and procedures precedes all, and to this at least we must he prepared to contribute.\r\nThe normalization of relations with Malaysia added point to the desire to make ASEAN a going concern. In itself, however, the resumption of diplomatic relations with Malaysia is desirable. It removes a source of unnecessary tension in Southeast Asia while permitting countries to pursue the solution of bilateral problem to the benefit of both, among them the antismuggling agreement.\r\nAs for the Sabah problem, it is our expressed desire and intention to settle it by peaceful means in consonance with the philosophy of our Constitution and by our commitment to the United Nations Charter. By agreement with the government of Malaysia, the normalization of relations was reached without preconditions, on their part or ours.\r\nIn accordance with the broad policy guidelines set forth above, I hope to finalize the plans for the approaching negotiations with the United States on the revision of the Military Bases Agreement, the Military Assistance Pact, the Mutual Defense Treaty, and the Laurel-Langley Agreement.\r\nThe implementation of agreements reached with other member-countries in the ASEAN will necessarily take precedence in our efforts to strengthen regional collaboration. This year, the Philippines will play host to the fourth ministerial meeting of the organization, and it is my hope that a food development program which has already been agreed upon in principle, will begin to take final shape.\r\nConsistent with our desire to widen relationships with other countries, I have directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to study the possibility of seeking an associate membership in the European Economic Community. With the establishment of diplomatic relations with Venezuela last year, we are in a position to launch a new campaign for stronger political and cultural ties with the Latin American countries.\r\nWith the exception of Nigeria and the Republic of Lesotho, with which we established diplomatic relations last year, Africa south of the Sahara is for all practical purposes a virgin territory to us. We propose to remedy this oversight, for we cannot long remain isolated from a huge region which shares common problems of growth and development with us. I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to prepare plans for a program of technical assistance to countries in Black Africa which may have need of this form of assistance.\r\nThe establishment of viable relationships with countries of Eastern Europe will continue to be an important objective of our foreign policy. Studies are being conducted by the appropriate government agencies, and the private economic sector has been requested to contribute its own information and plans.\r\nAs an original member of the United Nations, we take a deep interest in the continued viability of the world organization. It is still true that for most of the countries of the world, especially the developing countries, the United Nations is a Court of Last Resort. We shall continue to need it, more especially in the dangerous years ahead.\r\nIt is my feeling, however, that the functioning of the United Nations, with a membership nearly three times its original membership and saddled with problems not envisioned in 1945, could be improved, possibly by a revision of its Charter. Accordingly, the Philippines proposed the inclusion in the agenda for the coming UN session of an item calling for a review of the Charter, with an eye towards strengthening its peacekeeping functions and facilitating the formulation of a worldwide strategy for development.\r\nAs regards the Sabah problem, studies are in progress on how the conflict between Malaysia and the Philippines may be successfully resolved in the context of previous agreements. Although the formula is elusive, there is no reason to fear that the issue will remain in permanent deadlock. In the spirit of the new friendship between Malaysia and the Philippines, I continue to hope that the two countries can, in cooperation rather than as adversaries, find a solution to an intractable problem.\r\nThe social and economic inequities in our country are unacceptable. We have to institute radical reforms at once before the situation gets out of hand.\r\nThe next few years will lay the basis for a reformation\u2014a revolutionary reformation of our political, social, legal, and economic systems. The coming Constitutional Convention in 1971 will play a singular role in this task of reformation. We must see to it that the 1971 Constitution must be truly the expression of a free and sovereign people and will embody the ideals of Philippine nationalism, social justice, and economic progress. The 1971 Constitution must not seek to perpetuate the inequities of the status quo.\r\nIt is imperative, therefore, that the delegates to the 1971 Constitutional Convention represent the widest range possible of the various sectors of our society.\r\nWe are interested not just in reforms here and there, but in a sweeping overhaul of our systems to insure the good life and a just society for the Filipino people, and to meet the internal and external challenges for many decades to come.\r\nOne of the major sources of public disenchantment with the political system has been the electoral process. With its familiar spectacles of violence, coercion, and fraud, and its general inability to support the aspirations of our people, the present electoral process has been the object of popular disdain through demonstrations and rallies. Under the present system, it has become almost axiomatic that a poor man will not win in an election. With increasing frequency, public office is despoiled by men whose inclination to abuse and excess is demonstrated and sharpened at our polling places.\r\nI have always maintained that real security for the nation comes from prosperity and internal order. We have consequently geared our major programs to the fulfillment of these conditions as the final guarantee to our people\u2019s security.\r\nAt the same time, however, we must not overlook the requirements of self-defense in case of aggression.\r\nIn the context of new realities which loom large in the decade of the seventies, no less than a self-reliant policy can bring about a viable defense posture for the country. Pending resolution of our bilateral treaties in the economic and military fields, steps have been taken by the defense establishment to produce its own arms and munitions at the least cost to the economy.\r\nA restructuring of our armed services with an acceptable balance of foreign equipment support and locally produced items will be the principal focus of programming our defense requirements. In optimizing our defense posture to enhance our security in the face of competing objectives, the priorities in allocating resources in the Armed Forces will take into account the impact of military programs on our national development goals and objectives.\r\nThe defense establishment will play an important role in artificial rain stimulation and typhoon control and dissipation. This vital task to be undertaken by our Air Force in cooperation with the United States Air Force holds exciting possibilities and its importance is underscored by the fact that our total losses due to drought and typhoons last year amounted to P315 million, roughly equivalent to our present balance of payments difficulties. These are severe constraints on our development as a nation and if the Armed Forces, through this imaginative use of its resources, can only reduce such staggering losses even by 10%, they would, with this single measure, greatly improve our export posture and correct our foreign exchange deficiencies.\r\nIn the field of purely military undertakings, various alternatives for the development of effective internal security forces will be continually examined with the view of modernizing our command and control system and realigning cost ratios of personnel services to logistics. This concept is essential to the attainment of a self-reliant posture in the development of a logistics base.\r\nI am aware, however, that there will be 1,500 officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces who will be retiring within the next two years. This fact brings out the need to provide funds for AFP retirement benefits which have been building up throughout all these years. For this fiscal year alone, the AFP will need an outlay of P65 million to support its pension fund requirement. I therefore reiterate my proposal to sell selected military reservations, a portion of the proceeds of which will be used to fund the retirement of said personnel in conjunction with another proposal for AFP personnel themselves to contribute to their retirement fund. This retirement, which will include the top hierarchy in the AFP, will also necessitate the projection of a new leadership in the Armed Forces. I am confident that the emergent leaders in the AFP are quite ready and qualified to take over since they have the academic preparation; they have been battle-tested in the Huk and Sulu campaigns, in Korea, and in Vietnam; they understand our close ties with the Western world but are also aware of our Asian ties, and they are attuned to the dynamics of change and our posture of nationalism and self-reliance.\r\nIn regard to our efforts in Central Luzon, military operations there will continue to be supportive in nature and only to the extent that threats to peace and tranquility are beyond the capacity of local government officials to effectively stop and prevent. The PHILCAG has recently been deployed to Central Luzon in fulfillment of our commitment to alleviate conditions in that area in collaboration with other agencies. It is not my intention to keep PHILCAG on a permanent basis in Central Luzon. It is my hope that the civilian institutions\u2014both public and private\u2014which should be performing the tasks assigned to PHILCAG can eventually assume the responsibilities for these developmental tasks which properly belong to them. If we are to keep democracy alive in this country, there is no alternative but to strengthen these civilian institutions\u2014including the local police forces. I would like to see the day when our people can look up our local police forces with full confidence in their integrity and capability to carry out their peacekeeping responsibilities.\r\nThe development of a self-reliant defense posture stems from internal development through rational application of resources. In this direction, the defense establishment will continue to do its share in providing for whatever contingencies that may threaten internal peace and security.\r\nWork on the reorganization of government offices, which has long been overdue, is nearing completion. Under the Commission on Reorganization, 17 reorganization panels have conducted studies on how to trim personnel to produce maximum efficiency and promote the full use of resources.\r\nThe reorganization panels have proposed organizational changes which are responsive to the need for more efficient, economical, and effective administration. They have not lost sight, however, of the requirements of accelerated social and economic development, as the administration envisions.\r\nThe proposals for reorganizing government offices along those lines will be submitted to Congress as soon as possible.\r\nThe seventies are crucial politically. Since we regained independence in 1946, we have matured considerably. We continue to grow in courage, vision, and self-respect.\r\nWe have found that \u201cspecial relations\u201d are not satisfactory. We therefore seek full recognition of our sovereignty and full development of economic independence. We will not tolerate economic ties that will diminish our natural right of self-determination and self-government.\r\nIn the coming Laurel-Langley negotiations, we will protect our sovereignty, our rights of jurisdiction, and our self-respect as a mature independent nation.\r\nIn recent years, we have seen nationalism develop into a positive and constructive force. Along with it has grown greater confidence among our people, based on their increasing ability to decide their own destiny.\r\nThis is fortunate. For it is imperative that when we revise our Constitution, we shall do so with a full knowledge of our capabilities for sustained and self-reliant national growth, as well as of our ability to transcend political and other differences in order to work as one towards national objectives. This unity of purpose and action will require a stern will and a limitless capacity for endurance and sacrifice.\r\nThe time to begin developing this determination and strength is now. The discipline which we will need to achieve our goals must be tested from now on against the nation\u2019s numerous and varied problems.\r\nI have reported to you the gains we have made and the problems we have set out to solve. You will doubtless agree with me that the challenge of the future must be met by us together, the executive and legislative forces acting in concert. Convinced that our partnership is indispensable in meeting the requirements of progress, I now submit the following proposals for your consideration.\r\nI therefore come to you with several proposals: I propose the early passage of a liberal Export Incentives Act. The ultimate objective of this bill is to earn more foreign exchange for our industrialization program and to reduce unemployment. In addition, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Tariff and Customs Code should be liberalized with reference to the refund of taxes and duties paid or the issuance of tax credits for taxes paid directly or indirectly by exporting enterprises.\r\nAs a complementary measure, incentives should also be given to the tourist industry because this will provide us with valuable foreign exchange.\r\nI am proposing that an enabling act be passed to create an Export Guarantee Corporation. This corporation will guarantee our own businessmen against price fluctuations and credit risks. I wish to emphasize the importance of an integrated incentives program for the development of our export industries.\r\nIt is my hope that in this session, Congress will review the necessity of the subsidies especially the gold subsidy. Even under existing law, by-product producers of gold should be excluded from these subsidies.\r\nIn the last sessions of Congress, I submitted the new codification of the Administrative Code. Unfortunately, it was not passed into law. It is my intention to resubmit this code to this new Congress. At the same time, it becomes necessary for us to codify the labor laws, amend the Election Code and the Revised Penal Code, and update the Internal Revenue Code, as well as the Tariff and Customs Code.\r\nI envision the following reforms in our electoral systems:\r\nI propose that the Monetary Board be given the power to decide whether it should engage in the rediscounting of long-term notes which arise out of the manufacture of equipment and machinery in the Philippines. The commercial banking sector has been developing quite well but their operations have been largely confined to working capital financing. Our industries have developed to such a stage that we need long-term financing for equipment produced domestically. The domestic manufacturers are always at a disadvantage because they could not offer deterred payment plans unlike the developed and industrialized countries which could extend payment terms. In addition, I propose that the Central Bank should have overall control of all financing institutions. In other words, the entire financial system should be under the control of the Central Bank.\r\nOne of the main obstacles to the accelerated development of the mining industry is overlapping claims. A special court should be created for this purpose to clear the backlog. In addition, the mining law should be amended to allow for orderly prospecting and exploration. The prospectors and explorers should register and designate the area where they will operate. If a claim is then filed, work obligations should be imposed at a higher level than at present so claimholders do not sit on their mining claims. It is only through this process that we can hope for an accelerated development of our mining industry on which we shall depend increasingly for our foreign exchange earnings.\r\nIt might be good to mention now that a Land Policy Council should be set up. This council should decide our land use pattern. It should be the responsibility of the council to determine whether a piece of land should remain forestry land, or reserved for raining, or converted to agricultural or residential land. I suggest that we pattern our land use policies after Great Britain\u2019s.\r\nFinally, the present structure of production taxes hinders the integration of industry. It is disadvantageous to produce domestically certain industrial components such as car components because the sum of the taxes imposed at different stages of processing amounts to more than the duty on the importation of the finished products. Thus, backward integration is discouraged. Similarly, forward integration is discouraged in the field of mining because producers integrating forward pay a sales tax on a base which includes taxes previously paid in prior processing, whereas a mere exporter of mineral ores pays only the one-and-a-half percent ad valorem tax. Such inconsistencies in our tax laws should be removed immediately by imposing the taxes on value added only, thus permitting deduction of taxes already paid.\r\nTo generate more agricultural output and enhance the development, exploitation, and utilization of our natural resources, we propose the enactment of legislative measures\r\nI reiterate the need for passage of the bill certified in the last session of Congress to establish special funds for land reform and for peace and order. I also seek the approval of the bill authorizing the sale of military camps around Manila and suburbs to generate more funds for the Land Bank. I refer to Camp Aguinaldo, Fort Bonifacio, and Camp Crame.\r\nI look upon Congress as a true partner in all our urgent efforts to build and change the nation. I especially look to it to remain a partner that will provide the energy and direction to those particular endeavors that require the highest priority by the government.\r\nIn these critical times, the main argument for this partnership is the uncertainty of this new decade, which poses extreme and uncommon perils, even while it holds out bright prospects. Thrust into the full harshness of modernity, without having realized our full economic potential, we must bear the problems and satisfy the needs of an advanced industrial state with the scant resources, facilities, and skills of a developing one. Our needs are not always in proportion to either our status or our capacities; our wants are not always justified by either of them.\r\nOur people are haunted, if not altogether oppressed, by the conviction that they must share all the luxuries and comforts of the powerful industrial states; their appetites are whetted, their expectations increased, by the awesome advance which science and technology enable those other societies to achieve; and they feel themselves unjustly deprived and injured to have to do without the privileges and conveniences that other nations have.\r\nIn speaking of progress, they are compelled more and more to deal not in terms of their own particular development, but rather in the challenging terms of the risen technological and industrial classes who set the standards of growth and level of expectation for mankind all over the world.\r\nThis, ladies and gentlemen of the Seventh Congress, is our circumstance at the beginning of this critical decade.\r\nIn my second inaugural address, I pledged that the Presidency shall provide moral leadership, to change those attitudes and tastes that mock our aspirations and our capacities. I renew this pledge now; with an invitation to Congress that its members join me in setting the proper example of leadership, by passing legislation that will complement the moral influence of government.\r\nI leave it to Congress to determine how it will share this new ethical burden; for I dare not prescribe the required measure of dedication or commitment to this cause. But I issue the challenge to Congress.\r\nI said in my address to the Sixth Congress, a full year ago on this same rostrum, that given the options of living in the comfortable past and striking out towards new and uncharted frontiers, the people must choose the latter. My own choice was unequivocal.\r\nTime has brought us into the threshold of the seventies, But, by crossing the frontier I had spoken of in my last message, we have brought ourselves into the threshold of a new world.\r\nFor the Filipino people, it is a world of peril and opportunity.\r\nWe shall be in peril of losing our gains through fear and inaction. We face the danger that greed will vanquish the conscience of the rich. The pitfalls of disunity lie in our path. There is the ever-present danger that the courageous vision which enabled us to advance in the past four years will be overwhelmed by cynicism and hypocrisy. We begin life in the seventies wracked by growing pains. Timidity, conservatism, the impulse to resist change stand in the way, ready to thwart our advance.\r\nLet us all resolve to conquer these perils. Beyond them, prosperity and lasting peace wait to reward the nation. But prosperity will always be out of reach, lasting peace will forever be a chimera, if our desire for them does not become a passion and our labors to make them possible are confined to trickles and spurts.\r\nIt is not an easy triumph that we want.\r\nIn the past four years, when our purpose was to shake ourselves free from inertia, we had to strain our hearts and limbs in the unusual exertions of will and work to fulfill our aim.\r\nIn the process, we learned the lesson that must attend our present tasks. Today, we are animated by the aim of sustained national growth, and willpower must be built into the character of the nation as an enduring and indispensable discipline.\r\nDiscipline will move us, surely and steadily, into the future. It is the fount from which purposefulness and unity spring. In the coming years, we will need increasing courage and perseverance, a greater capacity for sacrifice, larger nobility, a stronger resistance to the temptations of sloth and personal fortune. We can equip ourselves with these only if we begin now to build the strength of character that comes from the discipline of hard work and unswerving purpose.\r\nI am confident that our people, to the last man, have it in themselves to meet the challenges, the duties and perils that we face. But we must together, citizen and leader at\r\nthe same time, exert a conscious effort to increase and perfect the Filipino potential into a powerful force in active confrontation with life.\r\nWe have indeed begun our task. We must continue and we must persevere.\r\nI thank you.", "title": "National Discipline: The Key to Our Future"},
{"delivered": "1965-01-25 12:41:03+00:00", "author": "Diosdado Macapagal", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 25, 1965]\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker,\r\nLadies and Gentlemen of Congress:\r\nThree years ago, on this very platform, we presented the Socio-Economic Program of the Nation designed to secure the objective of economic stability and growth of the country and the alleviations of the condition of the common man.\r\nWe were filled with conviction and enthusiasm; we were inspired with the bright hope that with the attainment of those objectives, national prosperity would be achieved and the level of livelihood of the masses of our people elevated.\r\nThe same optimism and conviction still inspire us as we look back in retrospect at the last three years. Despite the difficulties and odds that confronted us in the task of moving toward our desired goals, we submit that we have been able to accomplish tangible results in carrying out the fight against poverty by effectively laying the basis of future growth and progress in freedom.\r\nWe must begin with the fundamental act of casting a scrutinizing glance at the state of our way of life. It has become a truism that the Filipino way of life consists of three minimum elements, namely, the system of freedom, the love for peace and the sustenance of the rule of law. As long as these essential ingredients of Filipinism are safeguarded, the country, whatever its problems, is safe and the future of our posterity is secure.\r\nAs we perform our duty of rendering an account of our trust to our people, we are gratified that we have strengthened these fundamental tenets of our national life and destiny.\r\nThe system of freedom\u2014we have restored free enterprise. We have upheld the freedom of the press and other media to the tolerance of license. We believe so firmly in freedom that given a choice between licentious freedom and restricted freedom, we have by deeds preferred license to restriction because of our conviction that in an aspiring democracy in Afro-Asia, licentious freedom is better than restricted freedom because freedom has the inherent virtue of restraining its excesses but restriction bears the danger of curtailment which may lead to tyranny and despotism.\r\nLove for peace\u2014this is exemplified in the doctrine sanctified in our Constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national policy. We have served the cause of peace in our land by capturing Jesus Lava, the top head and brain of the communists who seek to overthrow our peace and freedom.\r\nNot only have we maintained peace and tranquility among ourselves but we have also been fortunate to be saved from the international turmoil that has beset our immediate neighbors like Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Free China and India. We attribute this to our policy of firm opposition to international communism, aggression, subversion and infiltration in our country and to our security alliance with the United States and other free nations.\r\nThe rule of law\u2014we all feel gratified that our people will not accept any system other than the rule of law which assures justice to the humblest citizen vis a viz the most powerful in the land. All have contributed to the impregnability of the rule of law in our society but we believe that the outstanding credit for this stability in our democratic institutions belongs to the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief of Justice Cesar Bengzon all of whose members have upheld with zeal the inviolability of the rule of law in our free society.\r\nSatisfied that we have bolstered the preservation of our free society, which is of overriding importance, we shall now review the results of our efforts in the last three years in the light of the goals that we have set and the conditions under which we were constrained to attain those goals for our people, deduce there from what remains to be done and draw a picture of the outlook for the future.\r\nThe things done which we shall speak of are the cumulative significance of the past three years. They were not the logical results of an economy allowed to maintain its sedentary pace in the mainstream of the status quo. Radical changes had to be introduced into the economic structure of the country. Drastic reforms in administration had to be undertaken, and tremendous efforts had to be exerted to provide the social services demanded by an expanding population in the face of inadequate resources.\r\nThe national objectives we defined had to confront, in their implementation, the reality of a situation the terms of which were not merely issues of the national condition but of the surrounding actuality of ourselves as a sovereign nation. We formulated those objectives at a time when the Philippine Republic had to exercise larger responsibilities within the Southeast Asian area as well as in the emergent community of the Afro-Asian continent.\r\nIt was for this reason that the most basic and fundamental change which was instituted by the Administration was to release the innate power of our people for progress by liberating the economy from controls and thus enabling our citizens to assume the major responsibility for national development.\r\nThe controlling idea of the Nation\u2019s program of free enterprise that we launched was nationalism, and the goal of that nationalism was economic prosperity and enlarged freedom for the masses of the Filipino people.\r\nWe shall now list the main results of our efforts on the progress of this program fro the people which we shall number one (1) to (109). The problem of restoring economic stability must inevitably lead to the necessity of creating an assured base for dynamic national growth.\r\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this connection, agricultural production rose by 4.8 per cent during crop year 1964, slightly lower than the 5.0 per cent increase registered the previous year. On the other hand, mining output increased 6.3 per cent over calendar year 1964, much better than the 1.5 per cent registered in 1963. Most encouraging of all, manufacturing production rose by 10.7 per cent for the first nine months of 1964, in contrast to the 6.4 per cent recorded the previous year. Production trends are, therefore, very satisfactory.\r\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, the spurt in physical production was accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic credits which as of October 1964 had risen by 13.5 per cent over the previous twelve months, a development which requires close watch.\r\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the external sector, foreign exchange receipts totaled $1,358 million or an increase of 17.4 per cent over the previous year. Foreign exchange disbursements amounted to $1,372 million, 19.4 per cent over 1963. Over the year, therefore, net foreign exchange disbursements amounted to $15 million. Correspondingly, the international reserves stood at $136 million by the end of 1964 compared to $147 million a year ago.\r\nThe success in attracting an increasing magnitude of private investments in the Nation\u2019s development efforts is to a certain extent dependent on the ability of the Government to lay the infrastructure conducive to enhancing investment possibilities in industry and agriculture.\r\nThe first area of priority was the improvement and expansion of our highway and land transport networks.\r\nFrom 1962 to 1964, the Bureau of Public Highways undertook the construction and improvement of 7,633 kilometers of national, provincial, city and municipal roads at a total cost of P107.9 million in addition to 3,500 linear meters of bridges constructed and improved involving an expenditure of P22.6 million.\r\nIn 1964 alone, P13 million was spent for the construction of 913 kilometers of feeder and secondary roads and the paving or improvement of another 975 kilometers; while P420,000 was expended for construction and improvement of 435 lineal meters of small bridges. During last year, a total of 27,550 kilometers of combined national, provincial and city roads and 31,000 lineal meters of bridges were maintained and repaired with total expenditures of P52,625,170 under the Highway Special Fund.\r\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among the major projects undertaken during the past three years in highway construction were the concrete paving of portions of the Manila South Road in Quezon, Laguna and Camarines Norte; the Manila North Road in Tarlac and Pangasinan; the Cabuyao-Calamba Road in Laguna; the Marawi City-Iligan City Road; the Balintawak-Novaliches Road in Quezon City; the Bagabag-Banawe Road in Nueva Vizcaya.\r\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Major asphalt road projects included the Baguio-Bontoc and the Benguet-Kalinga Road in Mountain Province; the Cagayan Valley Road in Cagayan; the Misamis Oriental-Agusan Road; the Surigao-Agusan Road and Iba North Road in Zambales.\r\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the major bridge projects were the construction of the Catarman Bridge in Samar and the Tomacalao Bridge in Ilocos Norte, and the improvement of Del Pan Bridge in Manila.\r\n7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As of the present, a number of highway and bridge projects are underway. These include the widening of the Manila North Road from Tullahan Bridge to the Malinta Section in Bulacan; the improvement of the Dalton-Sta. Fe Section of the Cagayan Valley Road; the Cotabato-Davao Road and million-peso bridge projects in Nagtahan, Manila; Buntun, Cagayan; Sipocot, Camarines Sur; Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro: and Padilla, Pangasinan. The construction of an underpass in P. Burgos Street and the improvement of the Guadalupe Bridge in Makati, Rizal, will soon be started.\r\n8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the Nation\u2019s project of a Pan-Philippine Highway System, the existing kilometrage consists of 26,223 kilometers in Luzon, 16,446 kilometers in the Visayas and 13,462 in Mindanao or a total of 56,131 kilometers of which 16% was paved, 62% paved with gravel or stone and 22% is unsurfaced. In this System, there are 11,333 bridges with a total length of 240,525 lineal meters of which 155,790 lineal meters or 65% are of contemporary construction. The completion of this project requires the concreting of 3,003 kilometers during the period 1965-1969.\r\nThe second urgent objective was the expansion of flood control and drainage and irrigation facilities.\r\n9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About 232 flood control and drainage projects have been completed with 92 more in various stages of completion. These projects which are estimated to protect 155,000 hectares of valuable land involved an expenditure of P29.6 million in the past three years. Notable projects undertaken were the Solis-Tecson, Paranaque, Blumentritt and Reyes Severino drainage mains in Manila and suburbs.\r\n10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five (5) national irrigation projects, serving a combined area of some 30,800 hectares, were completed during the same period. Construction of 13 other national irrigation projects, servicing an additional 60,000 hectares, are underway. In communal irrigation, 211 projects have been completed as of the end of 1964, with 25 others soon to be completed. These communal projects would add 60,700 hectares to our irrigated agricultural lands.\r\nNecessary to the program of socio-economic development is the task of power conservation and the scientific utilization of power for general well-being and public convenience.\r\n11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The thermal plan in Limay, Bataan, will have a 75,000 kilowatt initial capacity. Aside from increasing the power for the Luzon Grid especially during the dry season, this project will also serve the energy requirements of the Bataan Peninsula.\r\n12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even as these projects are being implemented, the NPC is pursuing other functions in its continuing efforts to develop additional power projects. These consist of surveys, investigations, project planning, geologic studies and design. In 1964 alone, the NPC surveyed six areas, investigated 31 rivers, planned four large-scale projects for development and assessed an additional power potential of 80,000 kilowatts coming mostly from small streams. This has brought the total assessed water potential to 2,680,000 kilowatts, including 1,416,000 KW in Luzon, 104,000 KW in the Visayas and 1,160,000 KW in Mindanao.\r\nComplementing the activities of the National Power Corporation in bringing the benefits of electricity to our rural populace is the Electrification Administration.\r\nThe 1960 census indicates that only 766,000 out of 4,648,000 total dwellings, or about 16%, were served by electricity; the remaining 84% of the populace, composed largely of rural dwellers, are without the benefits of electric service.\r\nThe capacity of the Electrification Administration to assist and encourage the establishment of a sufficient number of electrification systems has been seriously handicapped by the inadequacy of available funds.\r\n13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since its creation, the Electrification Administration has initiated some 40 electrification projects ranging from 30-kilowatt to 300-kilowatt generating systems, financed mostly from its allotment for capital expenditures during Fiscal Years 1964 and 1965. This performance, although it underscores a conscious direction of efforts in pursuance of desirable goals, is still insufficient to meet our total requirements.\r\nObviously, nothing short of a nationwide crash program could forge a major breakthrough in this particular field.\r\n14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, we have initially provided for the acquisition of $5 million worth of equipment and materials from Japanese reparations. This initial equipment outlay, refunds, will be adequate to install electric systems in about 240 towns. Additional equipment would be installed in subsequent stages of the program.\r\nThe improvement and modernization plan for the Manila International Airport is being implemented with a loan of $5.6 million from the Export-Import Bank of Washington.\r\n15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this connection, it is most gratifying to note that in our state visit to the United States last October, President Johnson manifested his interest in a nationwide rural electrification program as a possible area of American financial assistance.\r\nBut we are not yet satisfied with the above infrastructure development during the past three years. We are aware that there are still many projects which have been carefully planned but as yet not implemented due to lack of funds.\r\n16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, we have programmed for FY 1965 the prosecution of several essential projects. There are projects involving a school building program, irrigation, rural electrification, road construction, airport and air navigation, and waterworks and artesian wells, the total cost of which would amount to about P486 million. But we regret to say that without any substantial increase in government income, we may not be able to start on many of these projects due to the non-availability of funds.\r\nFinally, we are pleased to announce the successful public issue of $15 million worth of Philippine government bonds in the United States a few days ago; the issue was oversubscribed. Proceeds of this bond issue will be channeled to the NWSA expansion program and other priority development projects.\r\nThe success and the relative ease which characterized our foreign borrowing negotiations are strongly indicative of the soundness of our international credit position, the respect of other nations in our financial capabilities, and the confidence of these nations in our ability to adhere to our international commitments.\r\nIn the promotion of industrial growth, the government has provided a healthy investment climate through protection, incentives, and varied forms of financial assistance.\r\n17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, in the case of the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills project, a half-billion peso undertaking designed to meet the country\u2019s iron and steel requirements for industrial expansion and development, $62.3 million was obtained from the Export-Import Bank of Washington early last year.\r\n18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the coastwise shipping program, 40 million deutch marks were made available by the Kreditanstalt of Germany for loans to the private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines.\r\nThe most significant of the tax exemption laws, however, is the Basic Industries Law. At present, about 50 basic industries have availed of the exemption privilege. The magnitude in absolute figures of the assistance given to these industries in terms of tax savings amounted to P46 million from March, 1963 to June, 1964. Under our Administration, the Nation\u2019s small cottage industries have thrived and grown.\r\n19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The expansion program of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority was assured of $20.2 million from the World Bank.\r\n20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U. P. College of Agriculture in Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna obtained a $6 million loan commitment from the World Bank for the construction and improvement of its facilities.\r\n21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A $6 million credit line for the Ports and Harbors Program of expansion and modernization was re-negotiated.\r\n22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As of the end of 1962 when the new and necessary industries law terminated, 589 new and necessary industries were in actual operation, substantially developed and capable of operating without the need for additional assistance form the government.\r\n23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be mentioned here that the NACIDA, whose prime responsibility and function is the development of cottage industries, was established at the start of this Administration. After the first nine months of operation, the NACIDA registered a total of 1,770 cottage industries. For the past three years, NACIDA has conducted 410 researchers in foods, ceramics, fiber craft, wood, bamboo and rattan craft which have encouraged cottage industry activities along these lines.\r\n24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To coordinate the resources of the Government financial institutions for optimal effect, we established the Loans and Investment Council early in 1963. We are happy to report that the investment placements as of the end of 1964 of the member financial institutions have reached P3,538 million, an increase of 15.4 per cent over the previous year, and some 70 per cent more than the level of P2,077 million in 1961. Most of these funds have been used to finance vital agricultural, industrial, and commercial development requirements. The existence of the Council has also made possible syndicated financing by the member institutions for very large projects, where it might not have been possible for one institution along to bear the risk.\r\nSuch coordination never before undertaken has made possible the approval of the $62.3 million loan by the United States Export-Import Bank to the Iligan Steel Mills, and has facilitated the negotiations now going on between the Sta. Ines Steel Corporation and the Kreditanstalt of Germany. These two major projects when completed will supply the economy with 520,000 tons of steel products annually and will reduce steel importations by 80 per cent. The pace of industrialization will be substantially accelerated with these projects. Corollary steps are now being undertaken on the development of metallurgical coal, refractory bricks, the necessary technical services, as well as geological investigations and serial surveys.\r\nIn a country of scarce resources such as ours, it is imperative that public finances should be scrupulously administered so as to avoid situations where serious inbalances occur as a result of great disparity between income and expenditure.\r\n25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 1962, government receipts from all sources have risen appreciably on an average of about 17 per cent. From P1.2 billion in FY 1961, government collections increased to P1.6 billion in FY 1963 and to about P1.9 billion in FY 1964.\r\nThis gratifying performance was due mainly to the satisfactory efforts of the Government\u2019s collection agencies.\r\n26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gross collections made by the Bureau of Customs steadily increased from P564 million in 1962 to P631 million in 1963 and finally to P666 million in 1964. These figures show an increase of 11.9 per cent in 1963 and another 5.5 per cent in 1963 to 1964.\r\n27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the Bureau of Customs intensified its efforts against smuggling as borne out by relevant statistics. During FY 1964, additional taxes and duties collected at the port of Manila from technical and pure smuggling amounted to P8.5 million which was P3.5 million more than that collected in FY 1963. Additional collections effected by reason of re-appraisal and/or reclassification of imported goods after examination for the last three years amounted to P56 million.\r\nThe performance of the other major collecting arm of the government\u2014the Bureau of Internal Revenue\u2014was also noteworthy.\r\n28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the period from 1962 to 1964 gross internal revenue collection reached P3.6 billion as compared to only P2.3 billion collected for the period from 1959 to 1961. These figures represent a notable increase of P1.3 billion in collections. Significantly, collections from all major internal revenue sources registered increases thereby attesting to the efficiency of the administrative reforms implemented by that office.\r\nIn a developing country like the Philippines, the Government has the major responsibility of providing increasing service and social overhead projects designed to spur economic development.\r\nFor 1964 alone, a total P2.1 billion was spent for the purpose of operating the Government, providing facilities for peace and order and stimulating economic and social development. We must add that the expenditures of the National Government have been increasing over the years, and they will continue to increase as the population increases and the economy develops. In contrast, our income, even as it increases during the years, has not been of such magnitude as to cope with actual and programmed expenditure. Unless revenues are adequately augmented, it is estimated that from FY 1966 to FY 1970, a recurring revenue deficit averaging P425 million annually is likely to occur.\r\nThis projected deficit is based on the revised Five-Year Fiscal Program covering FY 1966-1970 of the operating departments and agencies and projections of revenues from existing sources. The gap would even be larger considering the new exemptions and use of funds for other purposes as contained in legislation passed during the last session.\r\nFurthermore, if all the existing appropriations under the General Fund for this current fiscal year were taken into consideration, and considering that intensified tax collection has already raised collection by 17 per cent, the disparity between expected revenues of some P1.9 billion and statutorily authorized expenditures of over P4.0 billion in the General Fund alone would be impossible to bridge, and would be meaningless for operational purposes.\r\nIn the light of this situation, we would stress again our resolve to pursue sound and prudent fiscal policies.\r\n29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, although the Government borrowed a gross amount of P377 million from January 1962 to June 1963, it redeemed P287 million.\r\nIn turn, it devolves upon Congress to tap new sources of revenue. When appropriation measures are passed by Congress, the Executive considers them not decisively from the availability of revenues but from the essentiality and importance of the service provided. It is the duty of the Government to provide and to find ways and means of financing such services which promote the public welfare.\r\n30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the fiscal position of the local governments showed marked improvements. Real property tax collections for FY 1964 were P26 million more than the collections made during FY 1961. The total gross income from general fund sources of local governments in FY 1963 was P54 million more than the income for FY 1961. In addition, local governments received, as their share from internal revenue collections of the national Government, P318 million during FY 1963, representing an increase of P100 million over what they received in FY 1961.\r\nThe role of government corporations in the realm of economic development lies essentially in undertaking ventures in new and untried fields where the risks involved may inhibit private enterprise.\r\nIn this sense, therefore, government corporations play a pivotal role in the attainment of our development objectives, particularly in the areas of production and industrial development and social amelioration.\r\n31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Cebu Portland Cement Company sold its Naga Cement Plant to a private corporation in August 1963 and since then has concentrated its activities to the promotion of the coal industry and coke processing. It has laid the groundwork for the establishment of a coking plant in Malangas, Zamboanga del Sur.\r\n32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a significant social experiment aimed at improving the condition of labor, the Government effected the transfer of the NDC textile mills to its employees. The GSIS has sold 5 per cent of its shares in the Philippine Air Lines. Moreover, the GSIS has decided to sell its preemptive shares in PAL to the private sector as it is still considering the eventual liquidation of its shares in this airline company.\r\n33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the transfer of the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills to a private group is being finalized, the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation have expanded dry-docking and shipbuilding facilities at the Bataan National Shipyards. NASSCO is now capable of undertaking repairs on Philippine Navy Ships, privately-owned inter-island and ocean-going vessels which before had to be serviced in Japan, Hongkong and the United States.\r\n34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A major undertaking of NASSCO now nearing completion is the Jose Panganiban project in Camarines Norte which is designed as the first modern pig iron smelting plant in the country for the processing of indigenous iron ore to pig iron.\r\nThe expansion projects of the Philippines National Railways (formerly the Manila Railroad Company) would extend its lines by 310 kilometers from Nueva Ecija to Cagayan in the North and the existing lines in Southern Luzon by 153 kilometers. Progress of these projects has been slow in view of financial stringencies being faced by the PNR.\r\n35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procurement of materials and supplies for the Sorsogon project will be accelerated this year with the signing of a loan agreement with Japanese suppliers.\r\nAt the root of the difficulties being faced by any developing economy is the problem of self-sufficiency in food, the ultimate necessity for life. The magnitude of this problem may be properly gauged when one considers that with our population increasing by 3.2 per cent annually, we have to feed 20,000 more mouths every week, or one million every year.\r\nThese considerations have spurred the Government to intensify its efforts in achieving greater productivity in food, particularly rice, corn, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. Of these, rice and corn, being the country\u2019s primary staples, received the greatest concentration of the Government\u2019s efforts.\r\n36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rice and corn production program of the Rice and Corn Coordinating Council, involving various forms of assistance to farmers, yielded encouraging results. During the crop year 1963-64, assistance under this program was extended to 311,889 rice farmers with an area of 493,853 hectares and to 21,851 corn farmers with an area of 49,340 hectares. As a result, rice production in assisted areas increased from 14.8 million cavans to 24 million cavans, with the yield per hectare registering a remarkable increase of from 30 cavans to 48.55 cavans or by 61 per cent.\r\n37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, the yield of corn increased from 789,000 cavans to 1,480,000 cavans. This represents an increase of almost 100 per cent in yield per hectare.\r\n38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from this continuing program to improve rice and corn culture, the Government also launched a crash program of rice production during the \u201cpalagad\u201d season of from January to June, 1964, in order to offset, to the extent possible, the rice shortage of last year. This was participated in by fourteen cooperating agencies headed by the administratively created Rice and Corn Authority, with each agency taking charge of a specific function, from farm planning, fertilizer and cereal distribution, soil analysis, research, irrigation to administrative and statistical coordination.\r\nThe crash program covered 170,082 hectares in 42 provinces with 77,205 farmers involved. Although only about 20 per cent of the area was fertilized and 33 per cent chemically treated, the yield per hectare amounted to 48.4 cavans, as compared to the national average of only 28 cavans per hectare in previous years.\r\nFrom the above results we can draw the assurance that, given the necessary implements and the means for carrying out far-ranging programs of this kind, the Philippines can eventually achieve self-sufficiency in rice. We are still stumped by the same problems\u2014fiscal, organizational, logistical and other problems. More than anything else, the habitual typhoons and floods in the country have done much to negate our efforts.\r\nThe Government\u2019s determination to pursue a consistent program of increased food production has been undaunted by these setbacks caused by nature, but the intensification of our efforts to expand the program to all areas is constrained by the Achilles heel of our developmental endeavor\u2014lack of revenues. More funds than are currently available would be required to achieve the ultimate goal of self-sufficiency and thus enable us to depend on our own resources.\r\nOur per capita consumption of meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products stands among the lowest in the world. In recognition of this deficiency, the Government has embarked on a long range program of propagating and improving our livestock and poultry population under the auspices of the Bureau of Animal Industry.\r\n39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, the number of artificial breeding centers was increased from only two in 1961 to 22 in 1964; natural breeding services, from 3,639 to 6,624; and artificial breeding services, from 6,002 to 8,882. Likewise, the number of existing propagation stations was doubled in three years from 36 in 1961 to 72 in 1964.\r\n40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government has also imported pure breeds, notably cattle, swine and chicken, which were either dispersed, loaned out or sold for breeding purposes.\r\n41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In disease control, about 3 million livestock and 84 million poultry were vaccinated in the three years from 1962 to 1964, and some 23 researches completed for the improvement of animal breeds and the cure of diseases.\r\n42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacture of biologics and sera has been maintained at an average of some 103 million doses annually.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that these activities by the Government are being augmented to some extent by private projects which are our prime hope for economic growth. There are now 24 feed manufacturers, three more than in 1961. Distributions of feed products are being facilitated with the increase in the number of retailers from 535 in 1961 to 782 as of last count. We have also seen the number of cattle ranchers increase in the last three years, from 312 to1,353, and the number of meat packing plants from 45 t o126.\r\n43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Farm-size animal and poultry raising projects likewise increased from 9,061 in 1961 to 18,902 in 1964.\r\n44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These activities have contributed in no small measure to the increase in poultry and livestock population for the period from 1961 to 1964 in these magnitudes; 22 per cent for carabaos, 26 per cent for cattle, 31 per cent for hogs, 24 per cent for chicken and 20 per cent for ducks. Not only have these increases cut down our import requirements of meat and poultry, but more important, they reflect a discernible breakthrough in our aspirations to bring our consumption of superior nutrients closer to Philippine nutritional standards.\r\nThe creation of the Philippine Fisheries Commission during our Administration under Republic Act No. 3512 afforded the Government a more effective vehicle for launching an accelerated fisheries development program aimed at increasing fish production from both inland and marine waters.\r\n45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corollary to the establishment of this Commission, an area comprising about one hectare of Manila Bay in Navotas, Rizal, was reserved as a fisheries development center by virtue of Proclamation No. 87, and earlier, Pier No. 14 was declared for the exclusive use of fishing vessels.\r\nWith these measures, the intensification of various fishery projects ensued in the following years. Fisherman\u2019s wharves have been started in Barugao, Leyte; Gumaca, Quezon; Damortis, La Union; Baguey, Cagayan; Bayawan, Negros Oriental; and Guiuan, Samar.\r\n46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the joint auspices of the Emergency Employment Administration and the Fisheries Commission, 10-ton refrigerated ice plants for storage were constructed in Mercedes, Camarines Norte; Sagon, Negros Occidental; Barugao, Leyte; and Bayawan, Negros Oriental. Smaller plants with 6-ton capacity were put up in Guiuan, Samar; Magallanes, Sorsogon and New Washington, Aklan. Assistance was also received from the U. S. AID-ACA in the form of refrigerated equipment valued at $200,000.00.\r\n47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are now almost 133,000 hectares of fishponds in operation involving a total investment of P265 million. Since 1962, a total of 941 fishpond applications has been received and processed, with an aggregate area of 34,670 hectares. Demonstration and experimental fishponds for bangos culture and other fresh water fish culture have been established in 36 areas.\r\n48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to these measures, steps were also taken to increase output in existing resources. The use of purse seine for deep-sea fishing has been emphasized; from only 6 in 1961, there are now 23 purse seine in use, with sixty more expected to begin operation at the start of 1965.\r\nWe see in these the chance of achieving sufficient supply for our domestic requirements and the beginning of a thriving export industry for fish and fishery products.\r\nOur forest resources continue to play a dominant role in the economy, being one of its traditional major dollar earners and a natural protection from the destructive effect of floods.\r\nHence, the Bureau of Forestry has instituted a system of sustained yield management through the selective logging method which has evoked favorable reaction from various sectors as an effective measure of conserving our forest resources.\r\n49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The activities of the Reforestation Administration during the past three years have been geared to this same end. Between 1962 and 1964, some 88,852 hectares were reforested and 319,674 hectares placed under maintenance. During the same period some 2,703,000 liters of seed stock were sown in the plantations where now stand some 193 million living trees. Were it not for the damage wrought by strong typhoons in 1964, the results would have been much more.\r\nThe development, exploitation and wise utilization of the mineral resources of the country are a continuing responsibility of the government.\r\n50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From 1962 to 1964, geological and mineral surveys conducted by the Bureau of Mines covered nearly 3 million hectares. From these surveys were discovered the aluminous laterite deposit in Bucas Grande, Surigao, the magnetite (iron) beach sand deposits along the Luzon coastline, and the asbestos deposits in the Zambales-Pangasinan region. Detailed geological studies were also conducted on the chromite deposit in the Zambales region; iron deposits in Ilocos Norte, Camarines Norte, Rizal, Oriental Mindoro, Zamboanga City and Zamboanga del Sur; copper deposits in Negros Occidental. Exploration work disclosed substantial additional reserves of coals, asbestos, nickelliferous laterite, nickel ore and alumina laterite.\r\n51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of far-reaching significance in the development of our vast mineral resources is the scheduled bidding for the operation of Parcel II of the Surigao Mineral Reservation, which contains an area of 40,000 hectares rich in supply of nickel deposits.\r\nIn recalling the crusade of the Administration to promote the welfare of the common man, we must necessarily make reference to the enactment of the Land Reform Code for we consider this event as the milestone of our endeavors. The welfare of the common man has been and continues to be our central concern.\r\nDespite the elimination of the Land Tax provision in the code, which could have provided adequate revenues with which to speedily implement Land Reform, we are happy to announce that the Government has been able with the meager finances available to gradually carry out its objectives.\r\n52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the National Land Reform Council, which coordinates the plans and activities of the different land reform agencies, we have been able to establish dynamic machinery which is capable, with adequate financial support, to transform the objectives of land reform into reality.\r\nVisible implementation, however, has been limited due mainly to the inability of present government finances to provide the fund requirements of the Land Bank amounting to P150 million. Tangible benefits were largely the product of the Land Authority\u2019s laborious efforts.\r\n53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Land Authority has undertaken a program to increase the productivity, to raise the standard of living conditions of the beneficiaries and to improve the administrative management of settlement projects and landed estates which were taken over from the defunct NARRA and LTA. This program involves settlements and estates, having an aggregate area of 452,296 hectares which accommodate 48,520 families.\r\n54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In consonance with the objective of acquiring land for distribution, three agricultural landed estates with an aggregate area of 2,214 hectares have been expropriated, while the expropriation of 7 additional estates with a total are of 6,487 hectares is still pending.\r\n55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To give substance to our program of land for the landless, distribution of land was undertaken involving LTA estates. As a result, 250 agreements to sell and 29 transfers of rights were issued, while 485 deeds of sale and 29 transfers of rights were issued, while 485 deeds of sale were released. Furthermore, 340 sales applications were processed and investigated and 80 orders of award were given to applicants.\r\n56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Land Authority has paved the way for the proclamation of leasehold areas in Plaridel, Bulacan; San Luis, Pampanga and at Concepcion, Tarlac. These land reform districts involve some 7,500 farmers cultivating an aggregate area of about 17,700 hectares of land.\r\nThese are concrete and tangible works which are eloquent proof of the government\u2019s firm resolve to make the Land Reform Code a dynamic instrument for fighting poverty through increased production. They should allay all doubts on the feasibility and certain realization of our ambitious and goals.\r\nBut these activities, heartwarming as they may seem, cannot be used to validly excuse the neglect and failure in providing the Government with additional funds which could have been channeled, among other vital needs, to accelerate land reform activities. To render the program fully operational, a total appropriation of P597 million would be required.\r\nThe problem of maintaining the nation\u2019s health requires nothing less than unceasing vigilance.\r\nThere have been marked improvements in sanitation, community water systems, drainage systems, refuse collection and waste disposal.\r\nIn our effort to improve the nutritional deficiencies among Filipinos, we are continuing to implement the Rice Enrichment Program with inspectors being sent to the provinces to assure its success.\r\n57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the last three years, 74 hospitals have been constructed or improved at a cost of about P19 million. In addition, the facilities of existing government hospitals have been expanded and bed capacity increase.\r\n58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further improve medical care to a greater number of patients, the Bureau of Medical Services has urged the growth and development of privately owned hospitals, which now number 238 and accommodate a total bed capacity of 10,811.\r\n59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three Medical Centers (Baguio General Hospital, Southern Islands Hospital and Davao General Hospital), and 20 hospitals were developed as teaching hospitals.\r\nThe campaign for disease control has continued without pause.\r\n60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Malaria control, we have developed a program which has been carried out with relative success. The morbidity and mortality rate from malaria dropped from 135.8 and 4.3 respectively in 1962 to 86.2 and 3.3 respectively in 1963 per 100,000 population.\r\n61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In tuberculosis control, over 3,000,000 patients were attended to by mobile units which covered a population of 9,000,000 people. Since 1962, 2,500,000 children were tuberculine tested of whom 1,500,000 were vaccinated with BCG. In large measure, this activity was the cause for the drop of tuberculosis mortality from 79.5 in 1962 to 72 per 100,000 population in 1963.\r\nWe must face realistically the classroom needs for public elementary schools. There are now 15,032 temporary classrooms and 3,269 classrooms in rented buildings. Due to deterioration, 6,415 classrooms need to be replaced every year. Considering the annual increase of enrolment of 300,000 there is additional need for 5,454 classrooms or a total of 11,865 classrooms which are immediately needed. This need requires an expenditure of P52.5 million.\r\n62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In spite of revenue limitations, we affected an increase of P95 million in the 1964-65 outlays for education over that of 1963-64. The magnitude of this increase is accentuated by the fact that outlays for 1963-64. The magnitude of this increase is accentuated by the fact that an outlay for 1963-64 was itself P40 million over that of 1962-63. Within two years, therefore, outlays for education rose by 37 per cent.\r\nOnly by increasing the budget for education were we able to solve the recurring school crisis brought about by rapid population growth.\r\n63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The additional amount expended made possible the appointment of 39,575 new public elementary school teachers over the last three years and the opening or construction of 4,673 classroom units with the capacity of absorbing at least 187,000 additional students on just a single shift.\r\n64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It also provided every public school elementary and secondary pupil with at least three books, or a total of 16 million textbooks valued at P36 million.\r\n65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of higher education, the progress achieved by the University of the Philippines is worthy of special mention. It has won the recognition and support of American foundations in an unprecedented manner and it has attracted Asian students in increasing number.\r\n66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three additional state colleges were established during the period in review namely, the Mindanao Institute of Technology at Kabacan, Cotabato; the Central Luzon Polytechnique College of Cabanatuan City and the Don Severino Agricultural College at Indang, Cavite.\r\n67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two universities, the Central Luzon State University in Mu\u00f1oz, Nueva Ecija and the University of Eastern Philippines at Catarman, Samar have been elevated from College status.\r\n68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the development of skilled manpower in agriculture, industrial, trade-technical, fishery and other vocational areas, it is heartening to report that whereas in 1961-62, the Bureau of Vocational Educational had 174 schools with an enrollment of 68,769; the school year 1964-65 finds it with 30 more schools and 17,988 more students.\r\n69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A significant contribution of the public schools to national production consists of their agricultural projects which involved the cultivation of 124,866 hectares producing varied crops with a total value of about P62 million. There are now 27,158 food production projects among public school students and personnel.\r\n70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To better equip our adult illiterates for greater opportunities, our education authorities have been implementing a program of adult education. About 18,242 adult illiterates have taken advantage of this program.\r\n71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To complement all these activities, there have been great strides taken to improve the private school system, the library network and the National Museum which is the repository of the national record and is charged with the heavy and crucial responsibility of \u201cperpetuating all that is desirable in the national heritage.\u201d\r\n72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our education officials have expended a major share of their energies towards the upgrading of the quality of graduates through the revision of curricula and the selection of qualified personnel.\r\nMany of us are aware of the fact that housing projects, both governmental and private, have literally mushroomed in the last three years.\r\n73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The enactment of R. A. No. 3469 was propitious for it made possible the construction of badly needed Multi-Storey Tenement Buildings with an initial appropriation of P15 million. The direct result is that the government is now in the final stage of completing the construction of for multi-storey projects which are located at Vitas, Tondo, Manila; at Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila; at the NDC Compound, Sta. Mesa, Manila; and at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Rizal.\r\n74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, we are implementing R.A. No. 3802 which grants tenants in all the PHHC\u2019s housing projects the right to purchase their homes at cost thereby affording them the opportunity to become homeowners instead of mere lessees. As of last December, 617 families have been able to avail of this right. In furtherance of our housing program, the PHHC has sold, to date, 1,542 lots to prospective home builders.\r\n75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, this Corporation is in the process of constructing six additional housing and sub-division projects in various provinces and has completed Housing Needs and Demand Surveys in various cities and towns in preparation for future activity.\r\n76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Department of Labor in its role as conciliator has met with significant success. During the past three years, of a total of 1,572 cases which were terminated, 808 had the department\u2019s active participation. Furthermore, it participated in most of the 918 bargaining agreements registered during the period.\r\n77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The past three years have witnessed a steady growth in unionism as proved by the 1,309 applications for registration of which 1,019 were issued corresponding certificates of registration.\r\n78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government is now embarked in implementing the new dimensions lent to our labor laws by the Land Reform program which extends the benefits of labor laws hitherto enjoyed predominantly by non-agricultural workers to agricultural workers as well. No less than 10,000 workers stand to benefit from Minimum Wage Order No. 1 which requires workers in the sugar industry to be paid P3.50 a day instead of P2.50.\r\nAdding substance and meaning to the overall improvement in our economy is the gratifying knowledge that more Filipinos were able to find gainful employment over the last three years.\r\n79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From May, 1961, to May, 1964, there was a net increase of 1,178,000 in our employed labor force. During the same period, however, the labor force increased by 1,020,000. Thus, the unemployed to labor force ration dropped by 2.2 per cent from 8.6 per cent to 6.4 per cent. This is unmistakable proof that we have succeeded in arresting and even reversing our unemployment trend.\r\nAs the productive capacity of the economy grows, we should increase the earning power of labor. As a member of Congress, it was my privilege to be the main author and sponsor of the present Minimum Wage Law which fixes a minimum wage of P4.00 a day for workers. In the previous session, we recommended the raising of the minimum laborers\u2019 wage to P6.00 a day or to such rate as Congress may deem just to both the laborer and the employer.\r\nChild and family welfare continues to be the focus of the Social Welfare Administration since its ultimate aim is to achieve a higher state of well-being for individuals, families and communities. Implicit in this aim, however, is assistance to the destitute, the sick, the handicapped, the old, the homeless and the devastated.\r\nThe Social Welfare Administration has performed excellently during the past three years in spite of fund limitations that affect all government offices and in spite of the ever growing demands for its services.\r\n80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When typhoon \u201cLucille\u201d struck in 1962, the SWA was the agency through which the sum of P14 million appropriated by R.A. No. 3467 was channeled to aid around 45,000 families, who were stricken victims of the typhoon.\r\n81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the SWA has in recent years given material aid to the old, the handicapped, the sick and the needy, at a yearly average of some 70,000 cases. It has given rehabilitative and cash aid to 730,483 disaster victims and victims of dissident operations and other destitute families.\r\n82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transportation aid was allowed to over 6,000 persons while financial assistance was given to over 2,000 self-help projects.\r\n83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It also rendered medical services to about 3,000 destitute patients a year and helped resettle over 1,300 families.\r\n84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the above this, the SWA handled an average 42,893 cases of families facing adjustment problems.\r\nThe task of screening the applicants for tenement housing called for by R.A. No. 3469 has likewise become this Agency\u2019s responsibility.\r\nThrough the National Integration Commission, the Government continued its efforts aimed at improving the living conditions of cultural minority groups numbering about 2.5 million people.\r\n85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the past three years, gratifying improvements were made among the farm settlements where a total of 6,958 hectares were cultivated. In addition, 35,286 hectares were surveyed. We are glad to report that 5,452 families have been settled.\r\n86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The National Integration Commission built 33 kilometers of feeder and dirt roads and provided irrigation for 163 hectares in several reservations.\r\n87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The NIC has devoted a large measure of its resources and energies to afford education to many of its wards. Over the last three years, it awarded 2,780 scholarships. The Commission has supplemented this by erecting schools in settlements and the releasing funds to provinces with large cultural minorities.\r\n88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has released P33,405 for the construction of 12 Health Centers within the settlements which are staffed by Bureau of Health personnel.\r\nIn line with our basic program of assuring adequate supply of basic commodities at prices within the reach of the common man, we have intensified the operations of the RCA and the NAMARCO of providing rice and other basic foodstuff at all times at reasonable and stabilized prices.\r\nThe NEC certified to an impending rice shortage for this year in the magnitude of 595,400 metric tons due partly to a series of unusually destructive typhoons which ravaged our crops. We are determined to find a solution to the problem of food shortage. We should not allow our people to go hungry. We trust that both houses of Congress share this sentiment.\r\n89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Primarily, we encourage domestic rice production by implementing a price support program through the RCA. This agency can claim the singular achievement of having raised the price of palay from as low as P8.00 per cavan to as high as P17.00 per cavan.\r\nNevertheless, the floor price for the rice support program of P12.50 is now inadequate and should be increased.\r\nThe palay growers being assured an adequate profit and incentive by the Government\u2019s price support policy, it is our duty to assure the consumers rice and corn at all times at prices within their reach. Towards this end, the policy of government importation of rice until self-sufficiency is attained in order to meet any shortage in the domestic supply should be maintained. The authority of the Government to import rice to bolster the local supply in order to provide enough rice to the people at reasonable prices, not only in emergencies, should be restored. We should assure to the consumers, through a complement of local and foreign supply, at all times rice of at least the ordinary macan variety at not more than P1.00 a ganta.\r\nThe RCA\u2019s other equally important effect is that it has been able to stabilize the price of rice instead of leaving both consumers and small producers at the mercy of middlemen and retailers.\r\n90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The NAMARCO in line with its charter objectives imported and distributed during the last three years some $84 million worth of prime commodities such as canned milk, canned fish and canned meat, all of which were sold at or below landed cost to consumers throughout the country.\r\n91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, its distribution network was augmented with the appointment of over 14 thousand additional retail outlets. Through this wide marketing network, it was able to sell also locally manufactured canned food products in line with its program of assistance to domestic industries.\r\n92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the start of our Administration, we have vigorously implemented R. A. 1194 which calls for government subsidy to stabilize the prices of tobacco and thus afford increased income to our tobacco farmers. We have done this despite the resulting heavy drain on government finances.\r\n93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have also approved R.A. 4155 which improves the financing mechanism in support of the tobacco subsidy. Whereas before, the PVTA had to wait for releases from the Central Bank which resulted in prolonged delays in the payment of purchased and allocates about P80 million annually for this purpose. It likewise facilitates the gradual liquidation of PVTA\u2019s enormous indebtedness with the Central Bank.\r\nThe Government is called upon to provide the major impetus to our social and economic growth.\r\nFor this reason we have striven to transform this Government into a flexible instrument of service; one that would be sensitive to the rising expectations of our people for a better life. This will explain our preoccupation with permeating all government offices and instilling them with integrity and efficiency.\r\nWe have pursued the objective of optimum efficiency in all government offices. Systems and methods were further refined and simplified and action guidelines laid down to minimize arbitrariness\u2014a major cause of inefficiency and graft.\r\n94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procurement and property disposal procedures were standardized and offices were more accessible to the public. The management system over Government property and records was revised. Due to all this effort we can claim that the present government machinery is in its most efficient and upright state since the Second World War; and we shall strive to improve it even further.\r\n95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An unheralded but typical example of our efforts for better public service is the \u201cOperation Barrio Titulo\u201d which was designed to deliver land titles otherwise lying idle in the Office of the Registers of Deeds to the very doorsteps of their rightful owners. From January 1, 1962 to September 15, 1964, no less than 19,519 titles have been distributed to farmers.\r\n96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Civil Service Commission has been a major factor in this drive for greater efficiency. It has been instrumental in the dismissal of 177 government officials and employees and meting out lesser penalties to 477 others. Appointments made and approved in violation of Civil Service Laws and Rules were revoked. Performance ratings were improved and administrative discipline again became a reality to all government personnel.\r\nAlso important to the success of the Nation\u2019s socio-economic program is the need for administrative reforms that would bring about more effective coordination among government offices and agencies commonly seeking the same objectives. Such administrative reforms could include decentralization of public powers to stimulate more participation in government by elective officials at the levels most proximate to the people.\r\nRealizing that efficiency and graft cannot coexist, the Government has intensified its exertions against erring officials and employees.\r\n97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Satisfied that corruption by high officials has been reasonably arrested, we have pursued our moral regeneration program to lower levels of government. Whereas the Civil Service Commission saw to it that only qualified men were assigned and retained in the service, the Presidential Anti-Graft Committee was assigned the task of checking, preventing and investigating government personnel and offices against charges of inefficiency and corruption. The Committee has caused the prosecution of 121 criminal and administrative cases. It has submitted 32 cases to the Civil Service Commission involving violations by public officials and employees of the Civil Service rules and regulations and performed investigations of anomalies and the evaluation of some 278 anti-graft cases.\r\nHowever, strict control is held over this committee in order to avoid trespass against individual rights.\r\n98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Armed Forces has assumed a major role in the effort to curb smuggling. Over P51 million worth of smuggled goods have been apprehended and confiscated.\r\nSmuggling, in its varied forms, constitutes a grave economic and moral threat to the nation. The solution of this problem requires the cooperation of all the people by not creating the demand for smuggled goods and in assisting in the apprehension of smugglers.\r\nAccordingly, we have strongly recommended the creation of an Anti-Smuggling Office which would be able to coordinate an effective campaign against smuggling. Although we have gained headway in our campaign against organized smuggling, much has still to be accomplished in the way of eliminating this cancer which continues to corrode our economic and moral fiber.\r\nOur program for national security calls for a minimum but capable force which can cope with any internal exigency and ready to respond t external challenges and commitments.\r\n99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crippling blow to the Huk movement consisting of the captivity of Jesus Lava, was just a culmination of a three-year drive which netted a total of 699 Kuks and criminals either killed, wounded or capture in addition to the 1,632 others which saw fit to surrender. In the process, 4,472 firearms were rounded up.\r\n100) Considerable headway was also made in combating cattle theft. Six hundred ninety-six rustlers were arrested and 1,544 animals recovered some 81 per cent of the total stolen.\r\n101) Equally successful was the campaign against illegal fishing which resulted in the arrest of 2,675 persons and the confiscation of 82,149 blasting caps and 16,314 kilos of explosives.\r\nThe dual function of maintaining the nation\u2019s internal security and the promotion of peace and order has become the major responsibility of the nation\u2019s armed forces. However, we feel that in securing peace and order, the greater responsibility should be shared by the country\u2019s police forces.\r\nConsequently, we should strengthen and improve our local police forces all over the country. We have recommended to Congress the enactment of a Police Reforms Law to ensure the fitness of those who are pledged to promote peace and order. We shall be happy to cooperate with Congress in the solution of this all important problem.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to commend the assistance being given by our civic-spirited citizens in combating crime, particularly the organization and active efforts of the Crusade Against Crime by Joaquin P. Roces.\r\nWe have confined ourselves to statements of facts manifest in the progress of the Socio-Economic program for national development.\r\nIt may be recalled that when the Socio-Economic Program was presented to the Nation three years ago our overall target was an increase in gross domestic product at a compound rate of 5.5 per cent, as the unavoidable hesitancy that accompanied the transition to a decontrolled economy left its mark.\r\n102) However, we are pleased to report to the Nation that for the second year of the Program, FY 1964, gross domestic product increased by 5.7 per cent, which is much closer to its target rate of 5.8 per cent; thus, the gap between achievement and aspiration is growing smaller.\r\nThe most immediate cogency and importance of the Socio-Economic Program of this Nation has been in being able to bring about a sense of prosperity which the tangible performance now promises to the Filipino people. The people are aware that what has been done so far are of immense implications for the state of economic and social institutions in the country. We feel that this sense of expectation has infused a new vigor to the Filipino people urging them to new heights of aspiration, giving them an assured basis for the steady vision of the good life and thus liberating the Nation from the lethargy that had held it as a consequence of the past colonial experience. A new condition of existence always proposes a new outlook and urges, in turn, greater strivings towards the ideals of increased social participation and responsibility.\r\nLargely, this has been the moral implication of the Socio-Economic Program of the country to fight poverty through increased production. But in the greater political sense, it has also promoted an intense and responsible nationalism\u2014a nationalism premised on the acceptance that while the Government must do all it can t enhance the general welfare, the state of the national society is a compendium of complex responsibilities in which everyone is to participate and exercise his right.\r\nWe believe that the Agricultural Reform Code has enhanced the faith of the Filipino masses in the Government, and by affirming the rights of the people in the face of an institution and social relationship established by the purposes of colonial regimes, the Agricultural Reform Code has provided the incentive for lawful assertions of individual rights, thus making it possible for the national society to conduct its various activities under the auspices of peace, freedom and security.\r\nIn foreign affairs, our conduct has been characterized by stronger assertion and greater involvement in the schemes of the Afro-Asian community in general and in Southeast Asia in particular. Our moral and political role has been accepted in Southeast Asia, and we have found identity with the Afro-Asian Nations in aspiration and ideals.\r\nOur emphatic belief in the justice of our cause pressed us to intensify the Philippine claim over Sabah.\r\n103) Our claim has been bolstered by the written support of Indonesia and the formal commitment of Malaysia to settle it by peaceful means, particularly through the World Court.\r\nWe are hopeful that the other Governments affected by our claim over Sabah, being like us adherents to the rule of law, shall pay proper heed to our just position to settle the matter through the World Court.\r\nLet it be stated in this connection, however, that we did not allow this issue over Sabah to keep our relations with Malaysia in a state of strain. Mutual steps have been taken by the Philippine and Malaysian governments to improve relationship in a common desire to minimize possible areas of conflict in this already troubled region.\r\nOn the whole, the conduct of our relations with the United States of America has been carried out in the traditional spirit of friendship as befit two nations which have close historical ties and share common ideals.\r\nThis has been eloquently confirmed by the results of my state visit to that Nation last October. On this occasion, the Presidents of both the United States and the Philippines held fruitful discussion over mutual problems.\r\n104) We also took this opportunity to conclude a Tax Treaty for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the prevention of Tax Evasion.\r\n105) In sympathy with our rice shortage, President Johnson donated on behalf of his Government, 25,000 tons of grain. He further pledged to make available 100,000 tons of rice to be purchased under the United States\u2019 Pacific Law 480.\r\n106) Let me also recall that it was under our administration that the late President John F. Kennedy signed into law U. S. Public Law 88-94 which amended the Philippine War Damage Act of 1962 and authorized payments of the balance of war damage reparations amounting to $73 million to some 88,000 claimants.\r\n107) We would also like to point out the successful conclusion, early in 1964, of the Bilateral Cotton-Textile Agreement between the Philippines and the United States which resulted in increasing the quota of our exports of processed and manufactured textile to the United States. These and many other manifestations of effective cooperation attest to the existing firm basis of our relationship with the United States.\r\nHowever, it has been almost two decades since we attained independent nationhood and world and national circumstances have changed considerably. The time has been reached therefore for treaties and relationships with the United States, which had been forged under conditions and events which are no longer present or intact, or whose compelling significance has greatly diminished in the face of current developments, to be scrutinized and updated in the light of present requirements for common security and benefit.\r\nThe advent of decontrol stimulated a considerable growth in our exports and thereby necessitated the expanding of foreign markets for our products. To this end, we have intensified trade promotion efforts.\r\n108) The Philippines signed an Executive Trade Agreement with Indonesia and concluded trade treaty negotiations with West Germany and Australia. A memorandum of Understanding with India was signed and discussions were held with the Korean Government to further improve the trade and economic relations between the two countries.\r\nConscious of our problems as a developing nation, the Philippines participated actively in the United States Trade and Development Conference in Geneva last year.\r\n109) during the conference, the Philippines was honored by the election of our head of delegation, the Secretary of Commerce and Industry, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the conference and who presided over four plenary sessions. Moreover, the Philippines was voted a seat to the World Trade and Development Board created to implement the resolution adopted by the conference.\r\nIn line with our policy to accelerate intraregional trade among Asian countries, Manila was made the site of the first ECAFE Ministerial Conference in December 1963 which adopted resolutions of far-reaching significance because they assured closer economic cooperation among the countries in the region.\r\nThe grinding poverty of many nations and the terrifying progress of weapons development have given this world two crucial issues\u2014the alleviation of misery of developing countries and the maintenance of peace.\r\nIn both issues, we believe that the United Nations and its agencies can and does play a paramount role. Because of this we have been and will persist in supporting and encouraging the activities of the United Nations and its agencies.\r\nUnder our constitutional system, the Executive and the Legislative share the common responsibility for administering the affairs of the Nation as well as providing the guidance, service and leadership required by our democratic way of life.\r\nIn view of this constitutional scheme of collective responsibility, we submitted to Congress at the beginning of our term a blueprint for national development known as the Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Development Program. By this program, we addressed ourselves specifically to the three-fold objective of accelerating the development of our economy, improving the living conditions of our people, and providing a strong basis of dynamic growth.\r\nTo bring about joint Legislative-Executive action for the implementation of this program of development, we recommended, during the 1963 session, the enactment of thirty-seven priority measures, including those affecting revenue-raising, and other economic stabilization and developmental measures. Only four of these measures were passed during the regular session of that year.\r\nThe enactment of the Land Reform Code required the calling of a special session.\r\nWhen this Congress resumed its sessions in 1964, the Executive again recommended enactment of the measures which failed to pass during the previous session, including several other bills relevant to the achievement of our socio-economic goals. Of these forty odd bills, only seven became laws which were bills of peripheral nature not designed to solve our basic problems. The more important and urgent bills were not acted upon.\r\nIt cannot be gainsaid that we have, time and again, pointed to the pressing necessity for enacting the major measures which could have provided necessary support to our overall socio-economic program.\r\nThe non-approval of these measures has resulted in denying to our country and people the funds necessary not only for the various infrastructure projects such as highways, airports, harbors, irrigation and power system, but also the essential elemental services of health, education, food and shelter. With the accelerated demands of the people for governmental services, coupled with our rapidly expanding population, it is obvious that more funds should be made available to meet the expectations of our people.\r\nThe lack of revenues has resulted in the deferment of essential and important public services The public school building program, the development program for higher education particularly the University of the Philippines, the training and mobilization of reserves for defense, as well as the development of the dairy industry are among those awaiting implementation. In the field of infrastructure, the construction of vital highways, airports, harbors, waterworks and irrigation systems, and rural electrification projects suffer delay. The salary adjustment of government employees, the pecuniary benefits due to veterans, widows and orphans, the payment of teachers\u2019 salaries and general financing and nationalized schools, the law enforcement and peace and order operations of the Constabulary, and the development of Mindanao, among others, have yet to be fully implemented.\r\nNot only has the revenue inadequacy impaired essential and important services and denied needed support to the public role in our economic program but also has withheld credit facilities available in government financing institutions from the private sector.\r\nThis need for increased revenue was appreciated by previous administrations and Congresses. A review of revenue measures enacted form 1950 to 1961 or during the incumbency of President Quirino, President Magsaysay and President Garcia graphically show that these regimes were beneficiaries of a liberal and realistic revenue policy. The margin fee as well as upward adjustment in personal and corporate income taxes, specific taxes on liquor and cigarettes, sales taxes on luxury and semi-luxury items, fixed taxes on businesses, occupations and professions contributed immensely to the operating and developmental funds of these administrations. On the other hand, since our incumbency in 1962, not a single revenue-raising measure, except possibly the revision of the Basic Industries Act and the imposition of a minor tax on logs, was enacted by Congress. In contrast, various tax exemption measures were passed which further depleted the already limited sources of funds available. The socio-economic programming has been denied the financial support envisioned by its planners and architects.\r\nWithin our limited powers, but acutely responsive to the hopes and aspirations of our people, we proceeded with the implementation of the socio-economic program. But ultimate success cannot be achieved by Presidential action alone; complementary legislative action is indispensable. Such indeed is the mandate of our Constitution. We submit it to be the inescapable duty of Congress to participate in a dynamic program of nation-building and public service through the enactment of legislation which would insure our continuing progress and the people\u2019s welfare.\r\nIn the coming months, the Nation is apprehensive that politics will occupy priority in the plans and activities of our national leaders. This situation is indeed far from ideal\u2014certainly not the proper approach to the needs and exigencies of the times.\r\nIn a sense, it is perhaps proper that the Filipino people should feel a stake in the issues of our politics. These are times of challenges. We have seen the emergence of an Asian country, Red China, into an atomic power with all its ominous consequences. Within the context of the national society, we have to make a choice, a choice of which the odds should indeed be foreknown; for if ours be to make a decision between economic progress and the achievement of the good life for our people on one hand and economic stagnancy and the perpetuation of our traditional social ills in the status quo on the other, then the preference needs no further debate: our politics must affirm the interests and welfare of the Nation.\r\nWe can with sincerity say that the decisions of the Administration have been solely guided by considerations of public welfare. We have not hesitated to cross party lines in the appointment of individuals to vital offices when it was deemed that the general public should profit from the merits of these individuals. In conformity with the traditional features of a democratic society, we have necessarily to stand on the platform of a definite political party but we have also pledged the commitment of this party not to a group or an institution but to the well-being of the whole Filipino Nation.\r\nWe appeal, therefore, to the patriotism of all our leaders and people to act in concert and cooperation, to continue the tasks that have already been done in the interest of all and to join the Government in the implementation of those projects and programs necessary to national growth and development. Political parties, if they are to be representative of the general will and interests, should not allow themselves to be divided on intentions that seek the betterment of human life in the national society. Whatever disagreements we have, on the interpretation of motives and the necessary means for the attainment of the public good, such disagreement nevertheless must not conceal the facts of achievement nor endeavor to obliterate the tangible work that has already been achieve.\r\nThe national progresses which we have endeavored to present are the cumulative results of the program we outlined in this platform three years ago. As we enter a new year, we have a justified feeling that even as there are tasks to be continued, a perceptible degree of change and reform has already been achieve within the national society.\r\nOf course, there are the recurring problems and the programs yet to be started which are aimed at enhancing the national life and elevating the level of general activities in our society. But it should be undeniable that we have already realized a stage of development and progress, and if we say that reforms and continued dedication are still required, it merely indicates that there is only the logical trend to be pursued but that the general premise of growth and advancement has successfully been established.\r\nThe burden of responsibility, however, continues, and in this, Congress must share shouldering the brunt. Some of the vital reforms needed and which we have indicated in this address would require legislative approval of necessary measures. We fervently hope that Congress will provide the necessary support and collaboration. For even as the Constitution has wisely provided for a system of checks and balances, it surely did not intend that the legislative and executive branches of the government be mainly concerned with checking and balancing each other to the prejudice of the national welfare.\r\nThe Nation has already been set into an impetus towards desired goals. We have established the basis and condition for consistent action and now, more than ever, the Filipino people\u2014the masses that had risked their lives for a conviction and so that a nation might be established\u2014now more than ever, they anticipate that their leaders should not betray their trust, but that, instead, should work in cooperation to further what has been done and to pursue the logic of the performance that has been accomplished in the past three years.\r\nTwo years ago, we had summed up the government accomplishments of a year by saying that what matters is that we know that we are moving; that the status quo, in response to what have been instituted, is changing and is transforming the relationships within the national society into a condition vibrant to progress and development.\r\nIt is for this reason that we have appealed for collaborative endeavors and joint responsibilities. Let us, once again, manifest a solid nationalism and present our position as a Nation before the world with the full powers that come from having a national purpose and integrity.\r\nWe are a young and developing democracy in a region in which the free way of life to which we aspire as the means to our welfare is not indigenous. As such, we continue to grow as a Nation.\r\nOur people are now matured enough to realize what is good for them and their children, which includes a reasonable measure of continued self-denial and sacrifice when necessary to promote the success of the Nation\u2019s fight against poverty. They have become aware that progress cannot be achieved by conflict but by cooperation among their leaders whom they have invested with their sovereign mandate. If we are to heed the sentiment of our people and become faithful to their welfare, we must endeavor, whatever our parties may be, to work constructively and harmoniously together not to promote our personal interests, political or otherwise, but to advance the progress of our country and the prosperity, well-being and happiness of the greatest number of our people.\r\nIndeed, the critical need of our Nation at this juncture of our history when we are on the crossroad or threshold of vigorous economic growth is national solidarity and unity. Now more confident than ever in handling the country\u2019s varied and complex problems because of our experience in the actual conduct of the Presidency, we shall endeavor to achieve to the utmost possible a maximum of national solidarity and cooperative endeavor with a minimum of partisan differences as the most effective way of serving the needs of our people.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we ask Congress to consider the enactment of the following measures in this session:\r\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To create incentives for investments and specifically clarify the investment climate in the Philippines and thereby delineate priority areas for both domestic and foreign investment activities in our country.\r\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To amend R.

{"delivered": "1969-01-27 16:30:52+00:00", "author": "Ferdinand E. Marcos", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Legislative Building, Manila, January 27, 1969]\r\nI have come to report to you on a nation transformed.\r\nTwelve months ago, I rendered to you and to the people an account of how we began to translate the Filipino dream of national greatness into reality. The central theme of that report was the achieving spirit that animated the vigorous partnership between the government and the people. Today, I ask you to witness with me the metamorphosis which the new achieving spirit of the Filipino people has brought about.\r\nIn 1966, when I assumed the stewardship of our government, all levels of our national life were wracked by traumatic crisis. With your help, we not only succeeded in overcoming those crises, we also began to stride forcefully and hopefully towards real progress.\r\nIn 1967, the energies of the nation were spent on the construction of the physical supports of our economy and society. Our heroic efforts were rewarded by numerous breakthroughs, principally in food production, public works, construction, and education.\r\nIn 1968, we expanded our scope to include the public services, foreign relations, domestic and foreign commerce, and industry. The year just past was distinguished by the confirmation of our competence for progress. In the barrios, to whose rapid improvement the year 1968 was dedicated, there is now a growing impatience for progress, a deeper appreciation of the need for self-reliance in meeting day-to-day problems of development.\r\nI shall describe more thoroughly our achievements last year in the next section of this report. Altogether, they signify an end and a beginning. The year 1968 saw the end of frustration, resignation, cynicism, and indolence, of complacency, and of indifference\u2014the chief obstacles to Philippine progress. On the other hand, the past year marked the beginning of purposive, concerted action for national progress\u2014the beginning of our national metamorphosis. For in 1968, we began to shed the habits of the past and to install in their stead new attitudes, new frames of reference, and new values. The result has been a widening of our vision, an expansion of our horizons, arising national strength.\r\nThis transformation is essentially spiritual.\r\nIt is a prophecy come true.\r\nIn his time, when there seemed little hope of Philippine freedom and progress, Jose Rizal saw that a new Philippines was inevitable. But to hasten that day, he prescribed a positive break with the past. He called on his countrymen to redeem themselves from a reputation for indolence, to acquire a new spirit for work and a new Filipino consciousness. There was no doubt in his mind about the requirements of progress: \u201cIn order that (the Filipino) may make progress it is necessary that a revolutionary spirit, so to speak, should boil in his veins since progress necessarily requires change; it implies the overthrow of the sanctified past by the present, the victory of new ideas over the old accepted ones.\u201d\r\nIn the 1890s Rizal saw the rise of \u201cnew men\u201d and a \u201cnew social order\u201d within a century. In 1968, the New Filipino and the New Filipinism came into being.\r\nI ask you to ponder this vital new force in the life of the Filipino people in relation to the pattern of national development since the 1900s.\r\nIn the economic sphere, our attempts at development from the turn of the century until 1965 were long on grandiose schemes and short on real accomplishments. Overdependence on a few agricultural products doomed our economic development efforts to failure from the very start. In nearly half a century until our political independence, no real effort was made to end our dependence on a single market, to look for new trading partners, and to industrialize the economy.\r\nThe ancient character of our economic life persisted even beyond the grant of Philippine independence in 1946, attesting to the feeble and unsuccessful efforts to change what has always been the root of our economic maladies\u2014the inequitable distribution of land. Excessive land holdings concentrated in a few families, on the one hand, and conditions of want and tenancy approaching slavery, on the other, comprised an economic structure that had to be, but never was, altered. This, together with the colonial status of our economy from 1900, consigned the Filipino people to a remarkably long experience of economic backwardness.\r\nThis condition is summarized by an American observer, who said: \u201c\u2026as it gained political independence, the Philippine Republic was still far from possessing economic sovereignty. The United States, on the other hand, retained some of the economic and military advantages of a colonial power while it was relieved of the burden of administration and of direct responsibility for Philippine welfare.\u201d\r\nIn the postindependence years, there were no important changes. Although the requirements of an expanding economy were appreciated after the wholesale pillage and devastation of the last war, the nation continued to make little progress away from its old patterns of land tenure, production, and foreign trade. The inertia of dependence may be best dramatized by the steadily increasing importation of rice which the Philippine government had to make from year to year, culminating in the unbelievable P264-million purchase in 1965.\r\nIndustrial growth was at first limited to the advantage of alien interests that were determined to keep the Philippines within the bounds of a limited agricultural economy; and then subsequently set on an erratic course by half-hearted efforts. By 1965, some industrial activity had been induced; but because of the catastrophic mismanagement of the national economy, 1,400 corporations were dead or dying or in dire need of massive government aid before the year was over.\r\nThese and numerous other difficulties can be traced to the period beginning with the turn of the century. These were, of course, to a large extent, due to our own backward economy, the most cruel feature of which is the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the rich and the poor. The feudal conditions among the peasantry, the stark contrasts and inequalities spawned by tenancy and landlordism, called for penetrating and drastic solutions. The continued impotence of government and society to respond to the legitimate demands of the poor and the oppressed gave rise to despondency and cynicism which culminated in the explosive discontent of the late 40s and early 50s.\r\nThe crime and disorder of the postwar years aggravated these conditions. These words of another American observer describe the chaos of the liberation years: \u201cAt the end of the war it was difficult to restore law and order and to preserve and foster democratic processes. Manuel Quezon was missed.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0The primordial struggle for existence gave a degree of lawlessness and criminality to practically every province and section of the country. Robberies, kidnappings, and daylight assaults on buses, trucks and trains were almost daily occurrences. The traditional respect for individual freedom and human rights was insufficient to counteract the petty criminals, the bandits, and the Communist-led groups who debauched the cities and disturbed the countryside.\u201d\r\nOur government machinery, indeed our existing political system, has been incapable of producing satisfactory conditions of living. All through these years, no serious attempt to correct obvious faults and deficiencies in our economic and social life has been made. The political structure that was erected during the first half of the century, save for a few insignificant alterations, has remained unchanged to the present day.\r\nThe inefficiency and the immorality in government are partly due to this defective political system. What is more, this political system has obstructed the democratic process. The system also has ironically been the chief obstacle to our progress. The sad truth is that we have kept our faith in democracy despite the inadequacies of our democratic institutions.\r\nExcessive partisan politics is responsible for the abuse of democratic principles in this country, and for the consequent inability of certain sectors of society to apply themselves with dedication and vigor to the advancement of the nation. There is an urgent need to curb the selfish and callous tendency of some of our leading citizens to engage in political activity at the expense of the public good.\r\nIt is for the purpose of answering this need that Republic Act 4880 was passed by Congress and approved by me on June 17, 1967. The provisions of this law are clear: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any political party, political committee, or political group to nominate candidates for any elective public office voted for at large earlier than one hundred and fifty days immediately preceding an election, and for any other elective public office earlier than ninety days immediately preceding an election.\u201d\r\nAnd again: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person whether or not a voter or candidate, or for any group or association of persons, whether or not a political party or political committee, to engage in an election campaign or partisan political activity except during the period of one hundred twenty days immediately preceding an election involving a public office voted for at large and ninety days immediately preceding an election for any other elective public office.\u201d\r\nIt is my hope, and undoubtedly yours too, that this lawful and necessary injunction is obeyed, this year and every election year hereafter, so that we may with the resulting harmony and cooperation, more speedily perform the common responsibility of nation-building.\r\nIt is fortunate that the nation will, just two years from now, call a constitutional convention. I leave it to the delegates of that convention to evolve a truly democratic system, one which will not merely bend, as our system does today, to the wishes of a traditional elite and perpetuate the status quo. Democratic institutions must be instruments of national advancement. Democracy must symbolize change.\r\nGiven these conditions and these premises, our principal tasks were, first, to lay the groundwork for the industrialization of the economy; second, to bring about social justice; third, to change the values and attitudes of the people; and fourth, to alter our foreign policy.\r\nIn short, our goal is nothing less than the complete transformation of our social, economic, and political milieu, the reorientation of our people\u2019s idea of themselves and of their capability, and the complete change of the assumptions that govern our relations with other nations.\r\nTo carry them out, it was necessary to make bold decisions. We did not hesitate to make these decisions because we know that they go to the heart of the matter and that they will change permanently the character of our national life. Our aim is clear: to set the nation on a firm and unchangeable course towards progress and independence.\r\nThis is the New Filipinism. This is the turning point.\r\nThe thrust of the administration\u2019s program has been towards a full and relentless application of our people\u2019s energies to nation-building.\r\nThis emphasis made its greatest impact on infrastructure development, food production, foreign relations, government reforms, labor and social services, trade and industry, and community development.\r\nIn specific terms, how did we implement the national desire for basic and far-reaching economic and social change?\r\nOur new investments program in its very first year has already accelerated industrial and agricultural growth. Consequently, vast new frontiers for individual and family advancement have been opened.\r\nAll these developments have been set in motion because of this administration\u2019s deep and abiding concern for the welfare of the great mass of the downtrodden and underprivileged. We must as quickly as possible rescue millions of our countrymen from the poverty and deprivation in which they have lived all their lives.\r\nThis is the immediate aim of all our endeavors.\r\nThe thrust to full development is unmistakable in every field. I sincerely believe that, with the continuing support of our people, the breakthroughs and innovations of the past year will, before long, establish a momentum which neither future negligence nor design can easily diminish or destroy.\r\nMany more aims, however, remain to be fulfilled by that partnership with government which, imbued with the New Filipinism, has brought us to this historic turning point. Our production in agriculture and industry must continue to expand. We must not forfeit the new vitality in the nation\u2019s life by another lapse into in action and indifference. We must further increase the national rate of growth.\r\nIn 1968, the economy grew in the manner that has come to be regarded as normal since the beginning of this administration: that is, gross national product increased at an unprecedented rate. According to the National Economic Council, real gross national product at 1955 prices increased by 6.3% in 1968 to a new level of P17.594 million. Both figures exceed the second-year targets of our Four-Year Economic Program which seemed so ambitious at the time they were set. The sector that led this growth was agriculture, which increased at the rate of 8.9% to P4,796 million, a new level.\r\nThe rapid increase in government facilities and services also has by now come to be accepted as normal. According to the latest report of the InfrastructureOperationsCenter, we have now completed more than three quarters of our four-year road asphalting program. In irrigation, we have rehabilitated or completed projects covering a total of 212,546 hectares and completed 106 kilometers of access roads. More than 42,165 new schoolbuildings have been constructed. These are only some of the evidence of internal expansion which we will describe in more detail later.\r\nA unique feature of the economy in 1968 was the realization of growth without the usual concomitant movement in prices. In developing countries, it is generally recognized that the forces that induce growth are exactly the same forces that put pressures on prices. The gains to our people\u2019s welfare resulting from an increase in income can therefore be minimized by the extent of price inflation.\r\nOn this score, our country had a significant year. Prices, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index for Manila, were literally held to a standstill. The CPI Manila level for 1968 was exactly equal to that of 1967. Consumer Price Index for the whole Philippines showed the same stability, registering only a 0.7% increase over 1967.\r\nAccording to the Economic Monitor, December 23, 1968: \u201cIn terms of prices, this year might yet rum out to be the most stable. For one, the consumer price index for Manila has not shown any appreciable change since January of the current year, increasing from 152.7 to only 154.2 last month or a minuscule 1.5 percentage points rise registered for the same period last year. \u201c\r\n\u201cThis relative stability of the general price level is apparently the offshoot of the success of the Administration\u2019s agricultural food production program notably in cereals. Meat and fish output were also reported to have gone up. All these factors are reflected in the small increase in the price index of food of only 2.8 percentage points, from 179.4 to 181.5. \u201c\r\nLast year, we expanded not only our economic but also our political horizons. It is probable that future historians will consider the political redirection more important than the economic gains.\r\nIn 1968, our foreign policy became truly international. We took the first steps towards the possible recognition and establishment of full relations with the countries of the Socialist bloc.\r\nThese countries have many things to offer the Philippines in terms of technical knowledge and trade opportunities.\r\nActually, the emphases have changed but the principles of our foreign relations are constant. We have been guided at all times by seven postulates.\r\nForemost is the national interest. Our foreign policy is always governed by our unswerving commitment to the welfare and dignity of the Philippines, by the need to protect our independence, territorial dignity, and national dignity.\r\nIn protecting and promoting the national welfare, we have at the same time strengthened our links with Asia.\r\nConsiderations of the nation\u2019s welfare also compel us to establish strong safeguards against the threat of communist aggression, infiltration, and subversion. At the same time, we have an open mind concerning relations with Socialist countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe.\r\nWe are firm in our belief in the rule of law. We have a rich tradition of freedom and civil liberties. Our foreign policy will uphold this tradition.\r\nWe have always supported the United Nations. We believe in viable and mutually advantageous regional defense arrangements.\r\nPeace and security are inseparable. We believe that progress in Asia is the common concern of the countries of the region. Their cooperation for prosperity and stability is possible only in a period of peace.\r\nFinally, we are resolute about accelerating economic development. We aim to overcome poverty not only in the Philippines but in the other countries of Asia as well.\r\nIn 1968, we revised the basic assumptions of our national defense. We assumed the eventual withdrawal of the United States from Asia and we began to make new defense plans based upon this contingency.\r\nIn short, in 1968, we began to consider seriously all of the responsibilities of political and economic independence, and prepared to assume these responsibilities. We made a hard and realistic appraisal of the Asian situation and the world situation that the Philippines is likely to face in the near future. We found that in many ways it would he a harsher world than the one we face today, a world in which the Philippines may be hard pressed even to survive as an independent country. We formed our policy for the future on the realistic assumption that this harsh world would indeed come to pass; and in this world, we planned not merely to survive but to emerge as a leader.\r\nWhat will be the contours of this world?\r\nOne of them we already know for certain, that our special relations with the United Slates will come to an end, at least in their present form. These relations have been a mixed blessing, and some would not be sorry to see them fade away completely. However, our industrialization program will require huge amounts of foreign exchange, and we still have not sufficiently diversified our export products and markets. We are carrying out such a program of diversification but in the transitional period, until this program is completely implemented, we must preserve the advantages that we already possess. Our needs for foreign exchange are so great that we must retain all the markets we now have besides making a vigorous effort to develop new ones.\r\nThe second feature of this new world is almost as certain. The United States, having been morally divided and economically strained by the Vietnam conflict, will seek to reduce its military commitments in Asia. For many this will be a severe but healthy shock. It will force them to abandon those outdated assumptions that are reinforced by the presence of a great and friendly military power.\r\nThe time has come for us to start looking out for ourselves, because no one else will. There is now an urgent need to modify our defense and foreign policies in order to make them hew closer to the national interest.\r\nThe third feature of this new world is somewhat more positive. The developing countries of the world, speaking as regional groups, have begun to assert themselves forcefully in the formulation of world economic policy. We have seen in the last few years the formation of several regional unions, the first operations of the Asian Development Bank, and two plenary meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We have seen the developed nations agree that nonreciprocal preferences should be granted to the exports of developing nations, and that in the interest of diversifying the composition of these exports, these preferences should be granted to exports of manufactured goods as well as to traditional raw materials and semimanufactures. During the current year, we may see agreement on a primary list of products to which these preferences will be granted.\r\nTo prepare our country for this new world we formulated last year the following guidelines.\r\nFirst, we must now industrialize further in order to end our poverty and in order to protect our national integrity.\r\nWe enter this difficult world with one important advantage: our breakthrough in agricultural production. Freed from the problem of feeding our people, we can concentrate more of our resources on industrializing our economy and on making our boundaries secure.\r\nThe pattern of development that we have chosen is the balanced development of both agriculture and industry. At this stage of our economic development, agriculture is an important support because it generates both the capital and the capability for industrialization. Our main export products, which earn the foreign exchange that we need to buy capital equipment, are still agricultural products. The complete neglect of agriculture now will only set back our plans for the industrialization of the economy.\r\nThis does not mean that this will be the permanent pattern of our economy. Simultaneously with the increase in the productivity and efficiency of agriculture and as soon as we have the capital resources and technology for industrialization, we will move on without hesitation to the industrial stage because industry is the only sure and lasting foundation of a strong, modern state.\r\nSecond, a drastic change in our foreign policy is necessary. For too long we have been too trusting of foreigners, unthinkingly accepting their beliefs and preconceptions along with their economic and military domination. From now on our foreign policy will be dictated only by our national interest.\r\nThird, our development will be our own affair. We are developing the Philippines for the Filipinos and it follows that all tools as well as all gains must rest in the hands of Filipinos. This is not by any means an expression of xenophobia. For certain phases of our industrialization program, the help of foreigners is necessary. In selected lines of industry, their rights and interests will be protected.\r\nFinally, since we shall be forced in the future to rely more and more on our own resources, we must develop greater efficiency and discipline. We have already begun to reorganize the government for greater efficiency and discipline. The spirit of this movement must permeate the entire society.\r\nAllow me now to discuss the achievements, problems, and policies of 1968 in detail.\r\nI have already referred to the satisfactory growth of the national product. For Fiscal Year 1968, we programmed a growth rate of 5.8% for gross national product. The actual growth rate was 6.0%. We expected agriculture to grow by 5.4%, a rate which already represented a considerable improvement over past growth. Such was the national response to our rice and corn production program that actual growth exceeded even this ambitious expectation, and the actual growth figure in real terms was 7.0%. In fact, as is now well known, we were able for the first time to export rice. The figures for Calendar Year 1968 are even more impressive. The growth in real GNP is 6.3%; in volume of agricultural production, no less than 8.9%.\r\nMining and manufacturing grew at the rate of 5.8%. Compared with growth rates in previous years, this is quite impressive, although it fell short of the target by 2.2%; although it is the impression of many businessmen that growth in the manufacturing sector was much better than what the official statistics indicate.\r\nIt is for this reason that we are reexamining the administration of government financial assistance and incentives, which apparently have not promoted as much efficiency in industrial production as we would like to have. There have been heavy imports of machinery, and conspicuous additions to productive capacity; but output has not increased significantly.\r\nI want the private sector to utilize our economic resources efficiently. There have been too many cases of wasteful duplication and the building up of unnecessary capacity. I now ask private businessmen to consider more carefully the needs of their industry and their country as well as their own enterprises; and I have required government financial institutions to be stricter in their evaluation of applications for government support.\r\nAnother policy I have been considering is to encourage mergers and other such rationalizations of the structure of industry. Our capital resources are too precious to be dissipated by unnecessary duplication. In the future, we shall require a much better return to the economy in exchange for government support.\r\nAs is only to be expected when aggregate demand increases, when higher incomes are available to a greater number of people than even before, and when industry is expanding at a fast rate, our balance of payments experienced some pressure last year. The difficulties were complicated by the fact that natural disasters prevented our exporters from taking full advantage of the higher prices that prevailed for our export products.\r\nThe deficits resulted principally from the country\u2019s impatience to grow. Close to three-fourths of total imports during the last two years were of essential and semiessential producers\u2019 goods, the demand for which arose from the combined investment programs of the private sector and the government. An additional one-tenth of our imports was in the form of essential consumer goods. Maturities of international obligations incurred in the past also contributed significantly to our balance of payments burdens. It appears that these pressures on our external position have been the cause of certain misgivings on the part of the business community over the future prospects of domestic credit, the exchange rate, and the international reserve. Indeed, the large volume of imports during the last two years partly reflect the efforts of traders and manufacturers to build up inventories in anticipation of adverse movements in the exchange rate or in fear of possible exchange controls.\r\nI wish to state in the strongest terms that there is no basis for these fears. The country\u2019s balance of payments problems are well within manageable bounds and can be handled without resorting to further credit restrictions, exchange controls, or devaluation.\r\nAlso, I am asking the Monetary Board to look into the possibility of implementing some suggested measures to be undertaken during the coming months to alleviate the pressures on the international reserve.\r\nThe first is to encourage commercial banks to avail of additional short-term borrowings from abroad by fully utilizing their available acceptance lines. In line with its policy of restructuring our external debt, the banks will be asked to stretch the maturity periods of their unused credit. The Central Bank, for its part, will provide commercial banks with automatic forward exchange cover of their external exposure arising from the financing of imports through acceptances.\r\nSecond, domestic importers will be given the inducements to finance their imports from trade credits available directly from their suppliers, whether the importers are independent companies or subsidiaries of foreign corporations. The general principle to be applied is that imported commodities sold locally for credit\u2014such as equipment, durables, and raw materials\u2014should also be imported on credit rather than for cash; thereby call on our importers to use, or to negotiate for, deferred payment terms from their foreign suppliers. The Central Bank will stand prepared to provide them with forward cover through their commercial banks.\r\nThese measures t0 avail of import credits are intended to minimize immediate drains on the reserves rather than to encourage larger volumes of imports at this time. The amount of total imports will still be subject to judicious moderation, both by monetary policy instruments and by fiscal restraint.\r\nThird, foreign-owned companies that enjoy the country\u2019s hospitality and profit from its markets are requested to refrain from adding to the country\u2019s foreign exchange burden by deferring the remittance of their profits abroad, particularly when such remittances are made possible by borrowing from domestic credit sources. Such profit remittances constitute a significant part of the country\u2019s annual invisible outflows. A judicious curtailment of such remittances will be a graceful token of the readiness of foreign companies to cooperate with the government in lightening the pressures on the international reserves. It will also be an expression of their confidence in the future of their host country.\r\nI ask those foreign enterprises which avail themselves of domestic credit facilities to finance their remittances abroad to refrain from making any remittances for the remainder of this year. I ask those enterprises which do not use domestic credit facilities to reduce their remittances in 1969 by 50%.\r\nFourth, we will intensify our program to tap foreign sources of long-term capital, in the form of loans or equity, whichever may be suitable under individual circumstances. This is in line with our basic policy that a developing country like the Philippines should absorb as much foreign financing as its future debt-servicing capacity will allow.\r\nFinally, we shall continue our campaign to expand the country\u2019s exports by working towards the establishment of a strong, aggressive merchandising capability and by gearing our internal investment policies towards the enhancement of our competitiveness abroad and the improvement and standardization of the quality of our products.\r\nThe investment priorities plan will give some idea of the likely new products that can be developed for export. As for market opportunities, one of the most interesting results of our missions to the Socialist countries was the list they brought back of the commodities we could export to the Socialist countries together with the prices that these commodities may be expected to fetch. This list, which has been widely publicized, has undoubtedly already attracted the interest of many of our businessmen. It shows that there is a wide range of commodities in providing which we can undersell the present suppliers to the Socialist countries by margins ranging from 10% to 70%. Some of these commodities, moreover, are traditional exports for which the regular markets are static or contracting or commodities of which there is chronic domestic overproduction.\r\nThe conditions under which sales to Socialist countries will be made seem satisfactory. Best of all, the Socialist countries seem to have a much more positive view of trade with developing countries than do their Western counterparts. Socialist imports from the developing countries have continually increased at a faster rate than their total foreign trade; and this seems to be their deliberate national policy. The reasons behind this policy are obvious, but there is no harm in our taking advantage of it if adequate safeguards are taken. Almost all of our Southeast Asian neighbors have been doing so for several years, and have generally benefited.\r\nWe should realize, however, that the country\u2019s success in raising long-term capital abroad depends on our own success in mobilizing capital at home. This emphasizes the urgency of generating domestic savings in massive proportions to finance investments in new industrial plants and equipment, in agricultural improvements, in public works, and in essential social services.\r\nThe Investment Incentives Act which Congress enacted in 1967 was designed to encourage the private sector to generate the capital for investment in new areas. The large number of applications for registration under the act by enterprises seeking to enter these high-priority fields is a convincing indication of the effectiveness of the act in stimulating private investments. I am confident that its operation will accelerate private investment efforts in the future as well as rationalize the country\u2019s overall development pattern.\r\nThe government, for its part, must keep pace with the country\u2019s requirements by continuously implementing its own development projects and by providing adequate public and social services. Any shortcomings in the government\u2019s efforts in these areas will pose serious obstacles to the country\u2019s total development drive.\r\nThis underscores the importance of new taxes. The need for more revenues is acute. It left us no choice but to ask, as I did, for new sources of income. We categorically reject inflation as a way of financing government development projects: The sources of funds must come from savings in the form of taxes.\r\nWe should, however, spare the low-income group from any additional tax burdens. The burden of taxation must fall on those who can afford it. The price of progress must be paid primarily by the wealthy, rather than by the poor. Moreover, our efforts to increase tax revenues at home will increase our international credit standing. They are a dramatic indication to foreign lenders of long-term capital that we are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to promote our economic development.\r\nLast year, nine tax measures were enacted into laws. These were among the principal recommendations embodied in the 1968 Tax Reform Program of my administration, which was drawn from the recommendations of the Joint Legislative Executive Tax Commission during this and the previous administration.\r\nThe collection performance of the BIR has remarkably improved. From 63% in 1964, the level of efficiency went up to 75% in 1967. There are strong signs that efficiency has improved further in 1968 as shown by our high tax compliance.\r\nTotal revenue collections have increased from P1,869 million in Fiscal Year 1966 to P2,589 million in Fiscal Year 1968. The total collections of the BIR and the Bureau of Customs in the last three years covering the period 1966\u20131968 increased significantly over that of the previous three years (1963\u20131965). Overall rate of increase almost doubled from 9.5% to 18.2% for the two periods. The increase in internal revenue collections rose from 12% to 15.7%, and that of customs collections, a more impressive increase, from 2.5% to 25.9%.\r\nAlong with the rise in revenue collections, the requirements of a growing economy for increased government facilities and services have also been increasing. In Fiscal Year 1969 alone, the total requirements of the national government amount to P3,450 million. However, the amount that can be generated to finance this requirement will only be P2,997 million, leaving a gross financial gap of P453 million. The magnitude of the problem is such that if we do not muster the required additional resources, we will not be able to meet our goals. Our goals are reflected in the growing demand for more schoolbuildings, housing, health, irrigation, power and water facilities, roads, communications, peace and order, and wage adjustments for government employees.\r\nI make a special appeal to Congress to enact the measures to enable the government to respond to these needs.\r\nIn monetary affairs, official effort was geared towards maintaining stability and servicing the financial needs of a developing and growing economy. Monetary action during the year was aimed at keeping inflationary pressures under control and overcoming balance of payments difficulties, which persisted throughout most of 1968. Towards the end of the year, however, there were positive indications of the effectiveness of monetary measures in containing credit expansion, improving the pattern of credit flows, and in relieving the pressure on the country\u2019s external accounts. The Central Bank also continued to play a key role in developing the credit markets and in ensuring the smooth functioning of the banking system.\r\nTo check excessive credit expansion, dampen import demand and channel the flow of credit resources from import financing to domestic production (particularly rice) and export production, several measures were taken. The more important ones included the selective reduction of the expansion of the Central Bank\u2019s credit portfolio from P630 million during January to November 1967, to only P300 million during the comparable period for 1968. In addition to raising the rediscount rates on a selective basis, the Central Bank also increased the margin requirement against selected import in the form of increased commercial bank reserves. Again, in October, ceilings on the credit portfolios of commercial banks were imposed to limit the volume of credit for imports at a specified level and to make possible the utilization of additional credit facilities for financing the production of rice and certain export products.\r\nIn the formulation of Central Bank policy, growth and development objectives were taken into consideration. This is evident in the selective character of the measures adopted during the period. More importantly, the Central Bank took the necessary steps to provide for the financial requirements of the rice production program which had progressed much faster than anticipated. Thus, outstanding Central Bank credit for the rice program increased by P150 million during the year.\r\nThe agreement of the International Monetary Fund was also obtained to increase the margin for Central Bank credit operations under the standby arrangements by P100 million expressly for the rice program. Significantly, despite the restrictive measures taken, economic development did not slow down. Production statistics continued to show improvements in agriculture and manufacturing.\r\nFor purposes of ensuring the external stability of the currency, the Central Bank acted to augment the supply of foreign exchange and to ease the pressure on the international reserve, particularly those brought about by the burden of servicing official short-term foreign obligations.\r\nIn line with this policy, a standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund of P27.5 million was secured. Upon negotiation of this standby arrangement, the U.S. commercial banks agreed to convert $81.5 million of their $234.6 million short-term loans to the Central Bank into medium-term credit (four years). In the process, $24 million of Central Bank deposits which were pledged against the short-term loans were released by the commercial banks. In addition, the Central Bank obtained a $60-million credit line with various commercial banks, of which only $10 million has been availed of by the end of the year.\r\nThe balance payments during the last quarter of 1968 resulted in a $25-million surplus after registering successive deficits in the four quarters ended July-September 1968 ranging from $14 million to $38 million in October-December 1967. The surplus arose from the reduction of the trade deficit from $81 million in the fourth quarter of 1967 to $61 million in October-December 1968 and the increase in the nontrade surplus from $44 million to $86 million, respectively. The leveling off of quarterly import payments, the gains inexpert and nontrade receipts, and the decrease in nontrade payments made the surplus possible.\r\nIn the foreign exchange market, Central Bank intervention to stabilize the exchange rate declined from $669 million in 1967 to $395 million in 1968. Although the average selling and buying rates of commercial banks was higher in 1968 than in 1967, the interbank rate which averaged P3.917 in 1967 declined to P3.916 in 1968.\r\nApart from stabilization problems, there were events which threatened to disrupt the smooth operations of the banking system. As a result of undue publicity given to the impending liquidation of two banks and the subsequent congressional investigation of the matter, a moderate run on banks took place in mid-September. To avert a national crisis, the Central Bank promptly extended full support to the banking system by granting about P100-million emergency loans. The Central Bank authorities also reassured the public of their readiness to extend their aid if necessary. By the end of September, after two weeks, the run subsided and the confidence of the public in banking institutions was reestablished.\r\nNotwithstanding this event, the banking system continued to grow and to expand. During the first three quarters of 1968 alone, 29 branches of commercial banks, 2 new savings banks, and 4 branches of established savings banks were opened. Twenty-nine new rural banks and seven branches of development banks were established to service the rural areas.\r\nInternal and external monetary pressures are interrelated. Easing of pressure on our balance of payments results in the relaxation of internal credit; and the effect also works the other way around. If new sources of revenue are found, then the Central Bank within our covenants with IMF can ease the restrictions it now places on both public and private borrowing, and will be in a much better position to improve the structure of our external debt.\r\nWhile the government borrowed a total of P1,602.88 million in Fiscal Year 1968, of which the amount of P1,332.85 million was from domestic borrowing and P270.0 million from foreign sources, a total amount of P1,048.4 million was redeemed. Of this redemption, P889.6 million serviced the foreign indebtedness. In the redemption of the external debt, P24.15 million was for the direct indebtedness of the national government, while P134.66 million was for borrowings of government-controlled corporations that were guaranteed by the national government.\r\nWe have, through the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, launched a Treasury Bills Program designed to provide the national treasury with funds during seasonal lags in revenue collections and at the same time to establish a private market for short-term treasury bills. These securities serve as a standard or benchmark for private investors as they are auctioned competitively and traded freely in the open market. The present success of the trading of short-term government bills indicates that a responsive money market for government securities has already been established in our country.\r\nThe promulgation of Executive Order No. 97 on October 26, 1967, which created the Financial Policy Committee, finalized the creation of an overall body entrusted with the responsibility of planning and coordinating the financing operations of the national government and its instrumentalities. Currently, the committee is concerned with the servicing of the external debt of the Philippines and its restructuring. It is now necessary to restructure our external obligations in order to reduce the pressures on our foreign exchange reserves.\r\nAnnual public expenditures under this administration were higher than at any other time. This was due to the increased social and economic demands of our rapidly expanding population.\r\nSocial development expenditures had always received the biggest cut from the government\u2019s fund resources (44%), while the allotment for economic development was never below 17%. In the last year of the past administration, the allocation for social development was only 31% and for economic development, 11%. Certainly, previous allocations were too low for the present size of our population.\r\nThe one overriding problem of government is lack of funds. This had hounded previous administrations; it continues to face us. This fiscal year, we are faced with a financial gap of about P450 million to P500 million. There are four alternative solutions to the \u201cfinancial gap.\u201d These consist of taxes, borrowing, greater efficiency in collection, and savings.\r\nOn taxes, we submitted to you last year a program of proposed tax measures. Some of them you have passed; the others you have not. On borrowing, you gave me the additional authority and we have done the best we can to avail of loans to support our development program both in the public sector and in the private sector. But there are practical limitations that prevent a full utilization of our legal borrowing authority.\r\nForeign loans usually require local currency counterparts. The generation of local currency on the other hand has to be done in such a manner as would not provoke inflation and balance of payments complications. We have also done much toward the development of a domestic government securities market, but this takes time and the absorptive capacity thus far developed is still insufficient.\r\nOn greater efficiency in collections, the record of revenue collections in both the BIR and Customs during the past three years and the studies of your own as well as our Joint Legislative Executive Tax Commission can attest to the degree of effort we have exerted in this area. On savings, I have already instructed the Budget Commission to effect a reduction in the current year\u2019s program of expenditures as well as to reduce by P200 million what had been originally programmed for FY 1969-1970. But we can go only so far in this area because we started in the first place with an attitude of spending only for the bare essentials. Our people rightly look up to us to provide them the services which they need. These consist of social overhead facilities or infrastructure as well as current services, such as those of education, health, and peace and order.\r\nWe cannot, therefore, refuse to heed these demands on the grounds of inadequacy of existing funds.\r\nMy appeal for new sources of income was not supported completely by Congress. My program called for an additional revenue of P1.2 billion, but Congress approved only around P296 million. I appeal to you again to enact in the next regular session the consolidated Tax Code bill, the gasoline tax, the specific tax on cigarettes, the omnibus amendment to the Tariff and Customs Code, the abolition of some special funds, the elimination of tax exemptions and subsidies, and the tax on idle land.\r\nThe construction of those numerous facilities which constitute the infrastructure for substantial and lasting progress has a high priority in our development program. Begun early in 1966, this has continued through 1968. In 1969, public works construction, principally road-building, will not only be continued\u2014 it will be accelerated.\r\nDuring the period from the turn of the century to 1965, the country had 995 kilometers of concrete roads, 7,268 kilometers of asphalt roads, 39,075 kilometers of feeder roads, and 76,693 lineal meters of permanent national bridges.\r\nIn only three years, the present administration finished 1,046 kilometers of concrete roads (or an increase of 105%); 1,502 kilometers of asphalt roads (a 20% increase); 5,694 kilometers of feeder roads (a 15% increase). We have also built 403 permanent national bridges with an aggregate length of 13,007 lineal meters (or an increase of 17%).\r\nThe previous administration, on the other hand, finished in four years only 70 kilometers of concrete roads, 458 kilometers of asphalt road, and 118 kilometers of feeder roads.\r\nIn addition, the Armed Forces have, in support of the highway program of the Department of Public Works and Communications, constructed 60,829 kilometers of concrete roads, 42,582 kilometers of asphalt roads, and 544,939 kilometers of feeder roads. The 51st Engineer Brigade of the Armed Forces, which constructed most of these roads, also completed two bridges measuring a total of 72.38 lineal meters, and various civic action centers throughout the country finished 71 bridges.\r\nAn important feature of the infrastructure program is the construction of prefabricated schoolhouses. In 1965, there was a backlog of 90,000 schoolrooms. In 1968, 42,165 rooms were made available through the fabrication of Marcos-type and army-type schoolbuildings. At this rate, we should have enough schoolbuildings by 1970.\r\nA total of 287 national buildings and 73 hospitals and sanitaria have also been constructed.\r\nThe Manila and Suburbs Waterworks System, a project partly financed with a $20.2-million IBRD loan, is now 79% complete. Expected to be finished in the latter part of 1969, it will provide the metropolitan area with 300 million gallons of water per day. We have also constructed 116 provincial waterworks and improved 121 others, built 516 artesian wells, rehabilitated 1,955 others, and developed 36 national springs.\r\nWe completed 12 national irrigation systems, work on which was suspended during the previous administration because of lack of funds. These systems irrigate 88,870 hectares. Through the rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigation systems and the installation of pumps, 120,219 hectares were placed under irrigation, making a total of 209,089 irrigated hectares as of 1968.\r\nStill under construction are 19 irrigation systems and 28 commercial projects. Under study at the moment is the Upper Pampanga River Multipurpose Project, which will irrigate some 81,000 hectares in Nueva Ecija and supply power and water to Greater Manila. Through the National Irrigation Administration, we are developing eight pilot projects on water management in collaboration with experts commissioned by the Asian Development Bank.\r\nApart from these projects of the Department of Public Works and Communications, the Armed Forces completed 227 irrigation projects in Central Luzon.\r\nTo relieve congestion in the ports of Manila, Piers 3 and 15 and the MarginalWharf of the InternationalPort were completed. A total of 105 other national and municipal projects around the country were finished to complement these ManilaPort projects. Altogether, these projects provide an additional 17 foreign and 151/2 domestic ships\u2019 berths. Transit sheds with a total area of 21,054 square meters were also constructed to accommodate the increasing volume of cargo.\r\nIn addition, through the combined efforts of the Bureau of Public Works and the Philippine Navy, we have dredged more than 36 million cubic meters of foreshore area at a cost of less than P1.00 a cubic meter, compared to previous costs which were as high as P5 a cubic meter.\r\nTo mitigate the destruction caused by floods, especially in the developed delta areas, we have concentrated our flood control works on five major river basins in the country. These works are the Manila Flood Control, Pampanga River Control, Agno River Control, Camarines Sur River Control, and Ilog-Hilabangan (Negros Occidental) River Control projects.\r\nTo support the growth of civil aviation and to meet the need of modern air travel, we have embarked on an expanded airports development program.\r\nWe have built or improved 22 airports, the more important of which were the Iloilo and Cotabato airports and the ManilaInternationalAirport\u2019s terminal apron. The construction or improvement of 33 other airports is now under way.\r\nUntil 1965, the Philippines was one of the three countries in Asia with the poorest telecommunications system. The growth rate of telecommunications in the Philippines was 7.6% annually, just slightly higher than Singapore\u2019s 7.5% and Indonesia\u2019s 6.5%.\r\nTo stimulate taster growth in telecommunications, we allowed the private sector to participate more extensively in this industry. Early in 1966, we limited the Bureau of Telecommunications to the function of developing projects in areas where the potential traffic is inadequate, so that private enterprise may make reasonable profits. In less than three years, private telecommunications companies burgeoned and prospered. Last year, these companies invested an additional $8,263,300, nearly thrice more than their investments in 1966 which amounted to $3,977,100.\r\nThe projected growth of the telecommunications industry is 10.5% a year. Our future program calls for an average yearly investment of $ 15,424,190. This annual additional investment will be provided mainly by the private sector.\r\nWe are now working on still another program, which is to get all telecommunications companies, government and private, to enter into interconnecting agreements so that a subscriber of one system could easily be connected to a subscriber of another.\r\nGovernment itself, however, has been more active than at any other time in the past in developing telecommunications. Some of our more important projects are:\r\nIn addition, we have completed the Philippine Communications Satellite (PHILCOMSAT) and the ground tracking stations for the Global Telecommunications System.\r\nThese do not include the massive expansion and upgrading work being done by the Armed Forces to improve their own telecommunications facilities. When I began my administration, the interservice communications system of the Armed Forces was primitive. The Air Force could not communicate directly with the Philippine Constabulary, the Army, or Navy. They had to course their communications through a central communications system. You can well imagine the inefficiency and contusion that this setup caused.\r\nWe have now considerably improved that system. The equipment of all services of the Armed Forces has been standardized and integrated, and their radio services interlinked.\r\nConcerning the satellite system that we have set up, the private sector has established the main line, which starts from Baguio to Manila and from Manila to Cebu, and finally all the way down to Cagayan de Oro and Davao. This is the main line from which other lines will radiate to all provinces and cities. For instance, there are 1,000 Cebu telephone exchanges interconnected with the Cebu-Philippine Long Distance exchange, which has five incoming and outgoing trunks. This alone has increased the power of our communications system a thousand times.\r\nWe have also set up a number of troposcatter stations around the country, including one in Ilocos Sur which will link us to Taipei.\r\nUp to the recent past, little attention had been given to the electrification of the rural areas. Last year, the administration took decisive steps to correct this situation.\r\nWith the assistance of the USAID, we organized nonprofit rural electric service cooperatives. Two such cooperatives have been organized as pilot projects\u2014one in Northern Mindanao and another in Negros Occidental. Their capital requirements were met by low-interest, long-term loans from both the Philippine and United States governments through their respective agencies. Six other electric service cooperatives in other regions are to be organized within the year. With the experience gained from these projects, we expect to extend the program of rural electrification through nonprofit, people-owned cooperatives throughout the country at the earliest time possible.\r\nPower development and transmission are also being accelerated. Feasibility studies are being made for the construction of a power transmission grid throughout Mindanao together with the gradual increase in power generation at the Maria Cristina Plant. A thermal plant is being constructed in Bataan. Plans are under way for the generation of about 1.5 million kilowatts in the Greater Manila Area and in Luzon within the next five years.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of providing our people with cheap electric power. Adequate power is the base of a modern industrial economy.\r\nFrom January through December 1969, we will pave 328 more kilometers of roads with concrete and 136 more kilometers of main roads with asphalt; build 1,742 more kilometers of feeder and development roads; and construct 10,949 more lineal meters of permanent bridges.\r\nBefore the year ends, we expect to complete the Manila and suburbs interim waterworks projects. We will also construct 65 more provincial waterworks systems. Studies are now being made to increase the capacity of the Manila and suburbs interim waterworks projects to meet the fast-growing needs of the area. Simultaneously, a master plan for a sewerage system for the metropolitan area is being prepared.\r\nSome 3,252 additional irrigation pumps will be installed. To meet this goal, we propose to tap Japanese reparations and to work out a deferred payment scheme for procuring additional irrigation units.\r\nWe will continue to improve the Port of Manila. We also hope to complete the reclamation of 31 hectares of port area and to construct a breakwater in the InternationalPort, a marginal wharf at the domestic port, and a Fisherman\u2019s Port at the NorthHarbor. We will construct and improve 17 other national ports and 53 municipal ports.\r\nWe will continue working on the five major river control projects already started.\r\nAirport development in 1969 will consist of concrete paving of aircraft movement areas, and the extension of existing runways to accommodate larger jet-propelled airplanes. The airports to be improved are those at Cauayan, Cagayan de Oro, New Roxas, Tagbilaran, Tuguegarao, Legaspi, Surigao, and San Jose (Mindoro Occidental).\r\nThe construction of 7 out of 45 airports programmed for permanent improvement will be undertaken. To accommodate turboengine aircraft, we have also programmed 33 airports for repair and improvement of runways.\r\nIn 1968, the National Power Corporation completed its 218,000-kW Angat (Bulacan) Hydroelectric Plant. The NPC also finished the third unit of the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric Plant, thus boosting the industrial development of the IliganBay area in Mindanao.\r\nWe have reduced the losses incurred by the Philippine National Railways from over P8 million at the start of our administration, to about P1. 8 million in 1967, and to only about P1.6 million last year.\r\nThe National Development Company invested 55% of the total authorized capital stock in the PHILCOMSAT, which in turn is the participant in the International Satellite Communications System, to which our Republic is a signatory. The Philippines\u2019 first station consisting of 12 circuits was inaugurated recently. This undertaking is not only highly beneficial to our economy, since a net operating profit of over P2 million is assured, but it will also revolutionize the communications system of the nation.\r\nTo meet the needs of the people of the rural areas more quickly, the GSIS established offices in Laoag, Baguio, Bacolod, and Tacloban. Very soon, branch offices will also be established in Iligan, Isabela for the CagayanValley area and in San PabloCity for the Southern Tagalog region.\r\nIn the past year, the GSIS has given no less than P99 million in salary loans and another P166 million in real estate loans. It has also granted P11 million in insurance claims and invested P128 million in stocks and bonds.\r\nThe SSS last year launched a massive low-cost housing program, financed the establishment of more public hospitals, liberalized salary and educational loans and extended its coverage.\r\nDuring the last three years, the SSS has registered 813,600 wage earners and 21,600 employers, or 24.8% of all wage earners and 36.7% of all employers registered since 1957. As of the end of 1968, member-employers totaled 87,000, while wage earners totaled 2,215,600.\r\nThe SSS has paid out a total of P153 million in all kinds of benefits over a period of 11 years and 4 months to about 460,000 members. Over one-half of this amount was paid in the last three years, during which the number of claims increased considerably. This increase could be attributed mainly to the speedy processing of claims.\r\nThe promise of this administration to promote low-cost housing is now being fulfilled. To give more meaning to the provisions of the SSS charter, the system starting in January 1968 embarked on a massive low-cost housing program for its low-income members. The revised housing program, which in the main grants loans to employers for the employees\u2019 housing project at a maximum of P15,000 instead of the previous P60,000, represents a major shift of policy. By extending the amortization of the loan from 15 to 25 years, the system has made it possible for the ordinary workers to own houses.\r\nThe SSS supports the Medicare bill now pending in Congress. This program will provide hospital and medical services to a large number of workers who, for financial reasons, would not ordinarily be able to pay for such services. The program aims to include the dependents of the members of the system.\r\nOne definite step we have taken to develop the less favored regions of the country is the creation of the Industrial Estates Corporation as a subsidiary of the National Power Corporation. Its first undertaking is the Limay Industrial Estate Pilot Project in Bataan. Similar projects have been programmed for CebuCity, DavaoCity, and IliganCity.\r\nThe Limay pilot project will yield lessons and examples for the establishment of similar projects in areas where economic development is sluggish. It envisions a complete industrial complex incorporating the industrial community formed by the Bataan Refinery, the ESSO Fertilizer Plant, the Bataan Thermal Plant, the Philippine Columbia Carbon Plant, the bulk storage facilities, and the Wood Mosaic Plant. A steel company, a textile company, a copper wire company, and sulfuric acid company have signified their intention to build their factories in the estate.\r\nAside from stimulating the growth rate of the economy of the country, the industrial estates project will help decentralize industries, and thus help minimize socioeconomic problems such as unemployment, criminal delinquency, sub-standard housing, and the like.\r\nWe stressed the protection and promotion of the quiet hero of our development\u2014the Filipino worker. In 1968, we multiplied our efforts in his behalf and for the welfare of his family.\r\nFor the first time in 20 years, the Philippine government last year succeeded in negotiating two separate labor agreements with the United States government, extending wide-ranging benefits to 61,000 Filipino workers in local U.S. bases and to 16,000 Filipinos employed in American offshore military installations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Additional monetary benefits for these Filipino workers under the agreements are estimated to reach P80 million annually. To these workers have been extended also for the first time the right to self-organization and collective bargaining.\r\nThrough the dollar repatriation program, our overseas workers in the Pacific and Southeast Asia may now safely and expeditiously remit their earnings to their dependents and beneficiaries in the Philippines through the Philippine National Bank. This program is not only a welcome convenience to them but is expected lo boost our foreign exchange reserve by some $100 million annually.\r\nIn the summer of 1968, without funds provided for in the Appropriations Act, we launched a \u201ccrash\u201d manpower development program for our unemployed citizens. The initial effort involved training centers in four provinces. A scant P100,000 and the facilities of trade schools and colleges were used. In three months, we were able to train 1,000 people in various skills to qualify them for immediate employment.\r\nInspired by this success, we directed the Manpower Development Council to undertake a nationwide program of \u201caccelerated manpower training.\u201d One hundred ten centers are now in operation from Batanes to Sulu.\r\nThe principal government agencies engaged in the manpower development effort are the Manpower Development Council, the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor. The program is also supported by city and provincial executives, leaders in industry, and agriculture, labor, civic, and religious leaders. Above all, it has elicited enthusiastic response from our people.\r\nIn the last six months, we have trained some 25,000 men and women at the cost of less than P100 per trainee. By the end of 1969, we hope to raise this total to 70,000.\r\nThe manpower development program is a breakthrough in the solution of the perennial unemployment problem. For the first time, we have set up a national program designed to give new skills to workers who otherwise would have no chance to get formal training.\r\nThe success of our program has impressed international agencies. Mr. David A. Morse, director general of the ILO, has paid tribute to our program which he held up as a model for the Asian Manpower Plan adopted by the ILO at its Tokyo conference last year. The United Nations Development Program and the International Labor Organization have given 75 scholarships and study grants for administrators and instructors involved in the manpower development project.\r\nThe United Nations has also granted our request for special fund assistance valued at $2 million to the Philippine national industrial training plan. This project will equip our research and demonstration centers in support of our manpower program.\r\nOur manpower program involves not only training but also placement of workers.\r\nA nationwide network of employment centers is the necessary complement to our skills training program. We have expanded the public employment service to strategic regional sites all over the country.\r\nWe now urge the city and provincial governments to implement the executive agreements for the establishment of their own local employment centers.\r\nAnd finally, we ask for the immediate passage of the manpower training bill which is now in the Senate.\r\nWe have intensified the enforcement of labor laws, resulting in the increase in restitutions paid to our workers by P12 million in 1968 over the previous fiscal year, or an increase of 35%. A highlight of this program was the attention given to our unorganized and underprivileged workers, principally the \u201csacada\u201d or migrant workers, other types of agricultural workers, and household help. In this connection, we have opened two employment offices in IloiloCity and BacolodCity to regulate the activities of contractors and middlemen who supply \u201csacada\u201d labor.\r\nWe have consistently encouraged and supported free trade unionism and collective bargaining. The administration unequivocally upheld freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining when these were threatened last year. We have also caused the repeal of the law requiring leaders of organized labor to submit nonsubversive affidavits every year. We shall continue to defend and preserve the rights of our workers to participate in shaping the conditions under which they work.\r\nIndustrial peace was more stable last year in spite of a few dramatic strikes. Work stoppages went down by 5% in 1968 compared with the previous year, and by 65% compared with the average for the previous administration. We have helped in the conclusion of 520 collective bargaining contracts and other agreements resulting in the payment of more than P180 million in wages and fringe benefits to 126,142 employees.\r\nMore than 47% of all strikes in 1968 arose from interunion jurisdictional disputes. In fact, interunion raiding has become a major threat to industrial peace. To arrest this alarming development, we call on organized labor, especially on the leaders of the leading labor federations, to get together and adopt a code of ethics with a workable provision for no-union-raiding. At the same time, we have asked the Department of Labor to prepare a bill designed to correct this problem.\r\nThe Filipino worker won substantial wage increase and fringe benefits and restitutions of wage differentials resulting from collective bargaining and direct enforcement work by our labor department. Roughly quantified, these accretions amount to about P350 million.\r\nWe have increased our voice in international labor affairs. The leadership of the Philippines in the conferences held by the International Labor Organization in Geneva and Tokyo last year was hailed by no less than the ILO director-general during his recent visit to the Philippines last year.\r\nThis year, as in previous years, we shall demand that the worker and his family be given their due share of the fruits of our national drive for growth and development.\r\nA Department of Labor study on the \u201cbrain drain\u201d problem has brought to light the exploitation of our doctors and nurses abroad under the exchange visitors program, and the unrestricted migration of technicians and skilled workers of developed countries. We have directed the agencies concerned, such as the Manpower Development Council, to attend to this problem, which adversely affects our economic development.\r\nWe accommodated 6.5 million children in the grade schools under the best conditions in the last decade. Our cumulative classroom production since 1958 exceeded 37,000 rooms. We had 1.5 million high school students and 640,000 college and university students. Our school population of 8.4 million exceeded the total national population of 60 other countries of the world. The schools and studentry were mobilized for development projects, especially for massive tree-planting and civic action activities.\r\nWe are revitalizing vocational schools and work education projects. We have paved the way for local responsibility for education by creating municipal, city, and provincial school boards.\r\nWe began a 10-year construction program of sports centers, by providing P1 million for athletic facilities for the interscholastics and P100,000 to P400,000 for regional meets, spread throughout the nation.\r\nRecently, Congress passed the special education fund, making available some P106 million from certain taxes for educational projects. The P106 million will be appropriated annually for new classes, schoolbuildings, textbooks, teaching devices, machinery, and equipment for vocational courses.\r\nWe have a program to aid private education, notably the Philippines-U.S. trust fund of P24 million from which grants and loans will be made available to private schools. Projects related to national development have been given priority. The fund will double in 10 years.\r\nOur government will also set up its own P24-million trust fund for private education. Earnings from this fund will help private schools update courses related to development. The fund will also be used to stimulate university growth in various regions of the country, thus easing student congestion in Manila.\r\nA big part of the $27-million war damage fund was given to private universities to encourage them to give courses in technology and science and to engage in basic research.\r\nWe have also funds to improve private medical schools. We plan a medical internship dispersal project under which interns will be asked to do a tour of duty in provincial hospitals. This might also arouse their social conscience and reduce the \u201cbrain drain.\u201d\r\nWe have given new stress to a textbook program. By 1970, we expect to produce 10 million textbooks at a cost of P40 million. About 3.5 million textbooks were turned out last year. To help hard-pressed parents, we scrapped textbook rentals in public intermediate schools. By the middle of this year, we will also do away with textbook rentals in public high schools.\r\nTo broaden college opportunities for young men and women in the rural areas, we plan to disperse colleges and universities all over the country. We hope to give incentives through tax privileges or credit arrangements to rural colleges. We also plan to disperse technological schools in areas with high agricultural and industrial potentials.\r\nWe continued to support the University of the Philippines as a free and independent institution of higher learning. The financial contribution of the national government to the university budget has increased by 100% since 1962, and the StateUniversity on its part has set the pace in our educational world while developing a nationalistic and Asian orientation in its courses and general policies.\r\nThe MindanaoStateUniversity in MarawiCity has been maintained as a center for Muslim studies and culture.\r\nWe have tried to push regional education projects such as a Southeast Asian regional center for graduate study and research in agriculture, and a center for tropical medicine in this country. During my state visit to three neighboring countries, I also proposed a University of Asia.\r\nAll these show that we have responded to the challenge of an imminent revolution in education that demands an educational perspective appropriate to a nation moving forward into the 1970s.\r\nAn integral part of national development is cultural growth.\r\nCognizant of its role in the cultural development of the country, the National Library has started the first postwar inventory of its holdings. To enable our scholars and students to use its collection, it has created special reading rooms\u2014an Asia Room, Theses and Dissertations Room, Rare Books and Manuscripts Room, Social Sciences and Humanities Room. It has also organized additional libraries, bringing the total to 32 provincial libraries, 16 city libraries, 229 municipal libraries, and 19 barrio libraries. We plan to set up reading centers in all barrios.\r\nThrough a National Advisory Council on Libraries, we intend to initiate a system for coordinating all types of libraries, whether public, special, university, and private libraries, to make the total library resources of the country available to all.\r\nThe role of a NationalMuseum as a medium for public education has had a positive impact on the community as evidenced by the increased number of visitors to the exhibition halls of the NationalMuseum, which has through its long-range program of cultural research gradually closed the gaps in the chronology of Philippine prehistory and history.\r\nOur present building for the NationalMuseum, however, leaves much to be desired, and we plan to provide a new location, possibly one of the government buildings at the Agrifina Circle in the RizalPark.\r\nOn the proposition that history is both inspiration and energizer of a nation, the National Historical Commission through public lectures, publications, exhibitions, and historical conservation sought to imbue our citizens with a deeper historical sense.\r\nOur national archival materials, now safely housed in the National Library, are being processed, cataloged, and microfilmed for the use of the scholars and researchers. This meets a long-felt need of Filipino scholarship.\r\nThe youth development program is a new concept for our schools. We have a three-pronged program: (1) for out-of-school youth; (2) for students; and (3) for integrated youth training.\r\nWe also have the Summer Youth Program to promote physical fitness and the productive use of leisure time.\r\nAlso under our youth program is the Summer Reforestation Project. I have released P175,000 for this program which now has 8,000 youth volunteers in 33 provinces.\r\nOther volunteers conduct free tutorial classes in summer for out-of-school youth. Senior vocational students give training in basic skills, while bright college and high school students tutor elementary pupils in civics, reading, writing, and arithmetic.\r\nWe also have youth volunteers working at community sanitation, repair of roads and bridges, agricultural extension work, literacy classes, and community beautification.\r\nTo know more about our children, the NationalCoordinatingCenter for the Study and Development of Filipino Children and Youth is undertaking a comprehensive study program. Research projects on subjects such as the value system, study habits, physical development, and nutrition of our youth have been conducted and the findings made available to the public. Clinical services have been provided; seminars and programs coordinated. The center also runs a Children\u2019s Village that serves as a laboratory school and demonstration center for better education.\r\nThese are some of the reasons why I believe in the capacity of our youth\u2014the new generation of Filipinos\u2014to lead the country forward. I am gratified that despite upheavals on campuses all over the world, our students have been more responsible. They demonstrate, but peaceably; they engage in the national dialogue over important issues and they are responsive to the challenges of nation-building. And it is precisely for this reason that I have initiated the move to reduce the voting age from 18 to 21 years. We want to keep them politically involved, responsible, and above all receptive to new skills, new knowledge, and new responsibilities as leaders.\r\nThe Constitution provides that the State must promote science and scientific research. But progress in this field has been very slow.\r\nThe following statistics should illustrate the paucity and inadequacy of scientific manpower and investment in our country.\r\nIn the United States, there are 853 scientists per million population; Russia has 772 scientists per million; West Germany has 486; France has 333; Italy, 350; Australia, 334. In the Philippines, we have 135 scientists per 1 million Filipinos.\r\nAgain, in the United States, the per capita expenditure of science is P90. In England, it is P60. In the Philippines it is from P0.60 to P0.65. This goes show how far we lag behind developed countries with respect to our investment on technology and scientific research.\r\nRecognizing the primary importance of science and technology in national growth, the government has accelerated its program to encourage scientific research and development far beyond all previous levels.\r\nOn April 6, 1968, we proclaimed 35 hectares located at Bicutan, Taguig, Rizal, as the site of the Philippine Science Community. On this land shall rise a complex of edifices to house research laboratories, multipurpose pilot plants, technical workshops, a science museum, a scientific library, and other facilities for research.\r\nThrough the National Science Development Board, we have completed 52 research projects within the last fiscal year and are now engaged in 181 projects. These studies, oriented to social and economic development, involve projects in agricultural and natural resources, industry and engineering, medicine and allied sciences, food and nutrition, behavioral sciences, and basic sciences. Although the government sector was the major recipient of grants-in-aid from the NSDB, private agencies were also supported in their research programs.\r\nThrough the manpower training program of the NSDB, public and private high school and college science teachers throughout the country were trained in several institutes and seminars.\r\nThe program of graduate and undergraduate training of science scholars was continued. Thirty-eight foreign scholarships for advanced training of deserving staff members of the board and its agencies were obtained from different international agencies and through bilateral agreements.\r\nThe government also conducted a workshop on fisheries and oceanography to accelerate fishery research and to identify areas in which science-based technology might be applied for economic development.\r\nWe shall utilize more fully private institutions for urgently needed research. The government will be ready to award important research contracts to deserving private institutions, including our colleges and universities. Tax incentives, including double exemptions, are contemplated for the promotion of private research. This is the kind of partnership that will effectively advance the frontiers of science in our country.\r\nOur principal problem is to break out of the prison of old attitudes and outmoded habits of thought. New realities confront us. We must adjust to these realities.\r\nOur nation, acting alone, cannot do it. I think this is the lesson that the sixth decade of the twentieth century has taught us. We must act in concert, small and great nations alike, to achieve common objectives. Despite Vietnam, the Middle East, and Czechoslovakia, the world to day is in a better position to meet, in common constructive endeavor, the challenges of building a durable peace.\r\nThe prospective conquest of the moon has electrified the imagination of the world. If we can harness the courage, the vision, and the daring of the space travelers towards the solution of terrestrial problems, then perhaps we can begin to make that bold stride towards the future.\r\nTwo great challenges face the world today. The first is the problem of peace and security. The second is raising the living standards of peoples everywhere. No one would dream of minimizing the difficulties of these problems. In both the stakes are large\u2014the future of generations to come and the survival of life as we know it. We of this generation hold the future in mortgage. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nI said last November, in a speech at the Manila Overseas Press Club, that we in Asia must strive towards a modus vivendi with Red China. I reiterate this need, which is becoming more urgent each day. Before long, Communist China will have increased its striking power a thousandfold with a sophisticated delivery system for its nuclear weapons.\r\nWe must prepare for that day. We must prepare to coexist peaceably with Communist China. For our part, this means relentless work towards full self-development, so that we can live beside our powerful neighbor with confidence and dignity. For her own part, Communist China must accept the fact that superior military strength cannot justify aggression.\r\nI believe that the faith and goodwill, as well as the competence, for peaceable coexistence exist in the heart and mind of all Asians.\r\nOne good result of the Cold War detente is the fragmentation of the Communist empire. Where there was only one center of power, today there are several. Nationalism within the former Communist empire, rather than ideology as such, has become the real motive force in the relations of the Communist countries with each other and with the outside world. The trend towards relaxation is clear. Communist China\u2019s willingness to resume the Warsaw talks with the United States, the Soviet Union\u2019s \u201cfeelers\u201d towards agreement on arms control are important straws in the wind.\r\nAs far as the Philippines is concerned, external Communist aggression represents a minimal threat\u2014at least not to the extent we once felt it to be. Our real problem is the growth of internal Communism arising from urgent economic problems. The main thrust of my administration is towards economic development or, which is the real meaning of economic growth, raising the living standards of our people.\r\nA just peace in Vietnam has always been our endeavor since the 1966 Manila Summit Conference. Any negotiations must provide room for compromise; that seems to be elementary. We feel that the principles enunciated in the Seven-Nation Summit Conference are sufficiently broad to provide leeway for both parties to reach agreement. The Paris negotiations will probably take a long time. But the fact that the Paris negotiations are taking place at alt seems to be a good sign. It is the clearest expression yet that a desire for peace exists; half the battle is thereby won.\r\nThe terms of the presumptive withdrawal of the United States from Asia have not been spelled out in detail. This may mean, at the least, a desire to avoid further involvement in Vietnam-type operations in Asia; or, at the most, diminution of economic aid and relinquishment of security obligations in Asia.\r\nOn the theory that U.S. withdrawal would cause a power vacuum in the region, Japan is being increasingly talked about as the inheritor of the role of the United States. All possible contingencies are being studied by the Philippines.\r\nMy administration is undertaking an intensive study of the problem.\r\nCloser regional cooperation has been one of the main tenets of my administration. To this end, we have formed the ASPAC, revived the ASA, and begun the ASEAN. The main drawbacks have been the lack of practical experience in regional cooperation. We are all, in a manner of speaking, undergoing on-the-job training. The other drawbacks are regional conflicts, such as the Sabah controversy between the Philippines and Malaysia.\r\nThese impediments are considerable but not insurmountable. The practical aspects of cooperation will be mastered in time and as for conflicts, they should be isolated and solved peacefully and in accordance with tested procedures of international law. In this way, we may succeed in preventing disruption of regional cooperation activities.\r\nFor this reason, we have proposed, more than once, the creation of an Asian political forum, to help solve intraregional conflicts or, at least, defuse potentially explosive situations.\r\nAnother reason we attach great value to regional cooperation is that, individually, the nations of Southeast Asia are hard-pressed to achieve the objectives of independence in the economic sphere. In the case of the Philippines, the first objective of self-sufficiency in the staple foods has been achieved. But beyond that, we feel that regional cooperation can accelerate growth.\r\nIf the Philippines were not convinced of the validity of its right to Sabah, we would be the first to say, \u201cDrop the claim.\u201d But we feel that on legal, historical, and moral grounds, the Philippine claim to Sabah is justified. We are bound to pursue it as a matter of principle and as a matter of justice.\r\nWe will pursue the claim peacefully in keeping with the spirit of previous understandings with Malaysia and in accordance with the principles of national law. The claim is in the national interest and we intend to pursue it by making use of all available peaceful resources. We are encouraged by the fact that many of our Asian friends are helping in the search for a modus vivendi between the Philippines and Malaysia.\r\nWe are passing through a transitional period in world politics and we have only ill-defined landmarks to guide us. What will emerge are, without question, new relationships among the great powers in Southeast Asia, and between them and the smaller powers, including the Philippines. What has become obvious, even at this stage, is an impending American withdrawal in the military sphere, an event of great importance to countries which have hitherto depended upon American military guarantees.\r\nOur defense policies have begun to take these emerging changes into account, to follow three guidelines.\r\nFirst, these policies should provide for a more flexible approach vis-\u00e0-vis the main powers in our part of the world.\r\nA more workable relationship with the United States, based on realism and mutual advantage, should be developed.\r\nSecond, Philippine defense policies must take in account regional defense arrangements.\r\nIn this connection, it should be noted that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) has been plagued by disunity, giving rise to severe criticisms as well as to doubts that it can and will do the part for which it was created in 1954. In any case, SEATO can, in the meantime, be strengthened. But another organization can issue out of the present situation.\r\nFinally, these policies should give a high priority to the peaceful settlement of our Sabah claims.\r\nSince the end of the last war, Philippine defense policies have been formulated in response to entirely foreign, domestically irrelevant crises, such as Berlin. Korea, the Congo, even Vietnam. For the first time, an issue of tremendous domestic importance has come up: to recover a territory about which a great many of our citizens, particularly in the South, feet strongly.\r\nThe settlement depends of course on a number of variables, any one of which may upset the formula for settlement.\r\nOn our part, we have been consistent with our declarations of peaceful intention. We have doused the war-fever that raged in the South. We shall continue to search for solutions that are in keeping with our dignity and integrity as a nation and with our regional commitments.\r\nOne of the most heartening breakthroughs of the administration is in rice production. We have always been known as an agricultural country, and yet\u2014to compound this seeming handicap\u2014we were one of the biggest importers of rice. In the last three years, we have dramatically increased rice production to a level never before attained. We began producing rice not only for our own consumption but for export as well. We have drastically reduced importation of rice from a record high of 570,000 tons in 1965 to zero in 1968. This means a savings of P264 million a year, the amount we spent to import rice in 1965.\r\nAs we had envisioned in 1967, we were able to export rice worth $5.9 million to different countries. We suffered a temporary setback in our exportation program due to the long drought that hit a wide area of Luzon and the typhoons that destroyed our crops. However, with the present trend in rice production, we expect to be able to resume exportation this year.\r\nWe attribute this success in rice production to the effective implementation by the Rice and Corn Administration of the Price Support Law which was enacted in March 1966. This Price Support Law increased the price of palay from P12 to P16 a cavan, and of corn from P9 to P13 a cavan. In addition, the RCA has a going program to improve warehousing techniques, rice milling methods, and marketing.\r\nAlthough we expect to be 7.5 million cavans shy of our projection of 121 million cavans for the Crop Year 1968-1969 because of the natural calamities that .came our way, we expect our rice supply to remain plentiful and the price to remain lower than the projected level, although higher than last crop year.\r\nWith the tremendous success and confidence gained, as well as the lessons learned in the last three years, we are optimistic about our agricultural capability.\r\nAlong with the tremendous success of the rice and corn production program, our development goals in agriculture were substantially enhanced by increased productivity in the sugar industry, the planting of new areas to coconut, the intensification of the cattle dispersal program, the opening of artificial insemination centers, and the revitalization of the fishing industry.\r\nThese have been made possible by the increase of technical knowledge and the channeling of fresh resources to the agricultural sector. Our experience in 1968 proved that only through the use of technology in agriculture can we realize the goal of maximum agricultural productivity.\r\nOne of the most significant developments in the last three years has been the increase in quality and quantity of agricultural research. An important factor for the breakthrough in rice production was the development and subsequent multiplication of the high-yielding varieties, like IR-8, BPI-76, College 18, College 4-63, and IR5. We now have corn varieties that yield three or four times the ordinary varieties. Superior strains of mongo, tomatoes, eggplants, bush sitao, sorghum, soybean, and sugarcane have been developed. Chicken broilers far superior to the common \u201cdumalaga\u201d and \u201cinahin\u201d have contributed to better nutrition for our people. We have developed a new chicken breed that can lay more eggs than the white leghorn.\r\nThese developments prompt us to view with boundless optimism the prospects of food abundance in the near future.\r\nHowever, in spite of the major breakthroughs we made in agricultural research, there is still much that remains to be done. We hope soon to make the Philippine Coconut Research Institute fully operational. It is crucial for us to improve the productivity of our coconut plantations so that we can ward off the encroachment of soybeans and synthetics in our traditional markets for coconut products. The same goes for the sugar industry. There is an urgent need to raise sugarcane productivity so that this industry can earn more foreign exchange.\r\nThe natural calamities that last year befell several of our major crops, particularly rice, sugarcane, and coconut, underscore the fragility of this important section of our economy. If Mindanao offers too great an attraction to agro-industrial entrepreneurs, it is largely because it is outside the typhoon belt and the rainfall is abundant and evenly distributed throughout the year.\r\nThe promise that was once Mindanao is now fast becoming reality. The influx of investments in new coconut plantations, citrus and coffee farms, bananas and pineapples, hog farms and cattle ranches in our southern frontier strongly attests to the foresight and pragmatism of our new breed of entrepreneurs who have chosen to go south. All these would not have taken place, however, without the vigorous support of our financial institutions who have gone into partnership with our pioneering entrepreneurs.\r\nA major deterrent to the development of our fishing industry is lack of cheap ice. To solve this problem, the Philippine Fisheries Commission started in June 1968 the Fisheries Infrastructure Program. The objective of this program is to provide the fishing industry with cheap ice and cold storage facilities in strategic fishing areas. The Philippine Fisheries Commission will establish 17 ice plants and cold storage projects in various parts of the country.\r\nBy the end of this month, we expect the completion and operation of five ice plants, one each in Mercedes, Camarines Norte; Masinloc, Zambales; Guiuan, Samar; Sagay, Negros Occidental; and Magallanes, Sorsogon.\r\nBy June of 1969, we expect two more ice plants to be in full operation. These ice plants are situated Barugao, Leyte, and Liminangcong, Palawan.\r\nBy the end of Fiscal Year 1969, these seven ice plants will produce 8,000 MT of ice. The remaining 10 ice plants are now in various stages of construction.\r\nWe expect to operate our 40-ton ice plant in Bato-Bato, Sulu, and the ice plant in New Washington, Aklan, by December of this year. Other ice plants and cold storages now under construction in Bayawan, Negros Oriental; Pala-Pala, Iloilo; Saravia, Negros Occidental; Dalahican, Quezon; Jolo, Sulu; and Pio Duran, Albay will be in operation in 1970.\r\nIn 1968, the volume of fish catch was about 745,000 metric tons, representing 68% of our nutritional requirements for fish. Our goal is to attain self-sufficiency in fishing by 1972.\r\nTo invite investments, the Board of Investments has made fishponds and deep-sea fishing priority areas for government assistance. A fishing port is being constructed in Navotas which will be backed up by the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market to serve a major outlet for fresh food commodities, including fish.\r\nCoupled with the investment incentives and the infrastructure support being given to the fishing industry, we now propose to set up a regional fishery research center with the support of the countries in Southeast Asia and Japan and the U.S. government. This center will conduct basic and applied research on freshwater and brackish water fishery.\r\nWe will also continue to stock our major lakes, swamps, and other inland bodies of water with fry and fingerlings.\r\nA major problem is the steady decline of our abaca exports. Technological advances leading to the development of many types of synthetic fibers have eroded our traditional market for abaca cordage. Sisal and henequen, which are cheaper, have also undercut abaca in the constricting market for natural fibers.\r\nWe have to find new uses for abaca. Long and painstaking research efforts are now starting to pay off. Several pulp and paper plants are now using low-grade abaca for pulp production. Abaca is now being used for tea bags. Studies are being made for the use of abaca for textiles as well as to replace jute in the production of sacks for rice, fertilizer, and sugar. The Gomez process for the manufacture of abaca chips as raw material for long-fibered pulp will soon be tested on a commercial scale with the establishment of a pilot project with the financial support of the National Development Company. The Board of Investments has included the manufacture of long-fibered pulp in the priority areas for investment. In the long run, diversification appears to be the only feasible solution to the abaca problem. In the short run, we are exploring new markets for abaca within the Socialist bloc; we have also asked our friends in the Western block to refrain from further disturbing the market for natural fibers.\r\nAfter so many years, we have finally taken the first bold step towards establishing an organized national marketing system which will stabilize the prices of prime commodities and which will induce qualitative and quantitative improvements in food production, thereby raising the income and standards of living of our rural population.\r\nI refer to the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market, or GMTFM, which will be the first of a network of food terminals to be established in strategic places all over the country. The GMTFM will rise, before the end of this year, on a 120-hectare lot in FortBonifacio along the South Superhighway. When completed the GMTFM will be a combined producer-wholesaler-transit market complex equipped with the latest in storage, refrigeration, food handling, and trading equipment for effective wholesale distribution of the produce of more than 1 million food farmers from 27 supplier-provinces in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao.\r\nThe GMTFM will not, as mistakenly believed, buy and sell for its own account but will provide the facilities and services to enable farm producers, wholesalers, and other legitimate traders and large-scale consumers to engage in spot wholesale buying and selling of fresh produce under conditions of free market interplay to prevent any group from monopolizing or cornering the supply of fresh produce.\r\nThe GMTFM will, however, not merely provide physical marketing facilities but will correct the sharp imbalances between food supply and demand, with their attendant violent price fluctuations. It will be deeply involved in various programs and projects intended to change the produce marketing system in our country, and it will protect the small food growers from exploitation by unscrupulous middlemen. It is presently engaged in the organization of cooperatives of producers who will be financed from production to marketing by six commercial banks chosen by the Bankers Association to the extent of P60 million to P120 million.\r\nAlong with correction of food supply and demand imbalances and erratic price fluctuations and raising the income of our rural population, the GMTFM will, among others, promote ancillary and service industries; strengthen the food processing industries by assuring them a steady supply of quality and graded food commodities; develop superior varieties of food crops; introduce new techniques of fresh food preservation, handling and transport, packaging and trading; create a favorable climate for the export of certain commodities; and even improve the dietary habits of Filipinos. All these will generate far-reaching social and economic benefits.\r\nIn 1968, we carried out a determined campaign to protect and conserve our forest resources. We enforced the selective logging system and the requirement to consolidate timber licenses into working units of at least 20,000 hectares with 25,000 cubic meters of annual allowable cut each.\r\nUnder the selective logging system, only the mature timber of at least 60 centimeters in diameter may be cut, thus leaving behind a healthy residual and logged-over area for future harvest. Thus, without damage to our forest resources, logging areas expanded significantly during the last three years, with the aggregate annual allowable cut increasing from 6,439,059 cubic meters in 1966 to 11,048,008 cubic meters in 1968. Consequently, the total income of the government from forest charges during the three-year period reached the unprecedented amount of P112,582,139.83.\r\nAt the same time, disposable forest lands were opened to profitable uses, including fishponds, recreation sites and resorts, pastures, private camps, radio stations or communications station sites, and the like.\r\nDuring the period, 10 watershed forest reserves with a total area of 103,107.6 hectares were established, while 16 other watershed areas were surveyed.\r\nReforestation is being carried out by the government, schoolchildren, volunteers, loggers, and civic organizations. However, their efforts are not enough. Vast tracts still have to be reforested. This year, we will intensify our reforestation effort. Our target is the reforestation of denuded watershed areas and forest parks. At the same time, we will improve our system of guarding our forests. I have also asked the relevant agencies of the government to prepare a comprehensive wildlife conservation plan. I intend during my incumbency to do everything to conserve our forests and wildlife.\r\nThe improvement of health services for the people, especially for those in the rural communities, is a principal program of this administration.\r\nOn free medicines for the people, the per capita expenditure of our government in 1965 was four centavos. Today, for free medicine, we spend 52 centavos per person. In other words, we are distributing throughout the country about P16 million worth of free medicines as compared to only P1.3 million in 1965 to 1966.\r\nThe rural health program of the Department of Health provides health and medical services to 80% of our people. As of July 1967, a total of 1,352 rural health units served the same number of municipalities. By July 1968, although additional units were created to increase the total to 1,459, still a number of municipalities remain unserved. Furthermore, of the existing rural health units, 1,000 are not completely staffed and are operating with inadequate supplies and medicines. We will seek to correct these inadequacies this year.\r\nWe concluded an agreement with AID for the establishment of 500 nutrition centers for children all over the country. At the same time, we are engaged in a campaign to show the need for better food, for we are all well aware of the nutritional deficiencies of our people.\r\nThe PACD continues to be an agent of change in our rural frontiers.\r\nOver the past three years, our barrio people completed with minimal government assistance a total of 128,158 projects worth P47,599,469.67 as compared to 24,306 projects valued at P13,365,522.50 during the four years of the previous administration. This means an increase of 427% in number of projects and 156% in project cost. These projects now serve over 6 million people.\r\nIn the past years, the PACD served 16,000 barrios as against only 3,600 during the four years of the previous administration. This is a gain of 345%.\r\nA new feature of the community development program is the participation of the private sector. Some of the major activities undertaken with private support are Operation \u201cKasama\u2019\u201d in cooperation with the University of Santo Tomas; low-cost housing project for rural areas in cooperation with the Archdiocese of Sorsogon; the Lanao special operations in cooperation with the Asia Foundation and Mindanao State University; and many others.\r\nThrough its volunteer program, the PACD with financial support from the Asia Foundation, initiated the Volunteers for the Improvement of the Philippines (VIPs), trained no less than 250 student volunteers from 16 universities and colleges in the Bicol region under the Bicol Students Volunteer Service Program (BSVS), and cooperated with the civic action program of the Department of National Defense in launching the Rural Service Volunteer Program (RSVP).\r\nThe PACD played an important role in the implementation of our rice and corn self-sufficiency program. Among its contributions are communal irrigation works, self-help barrio roads, farm to-market roads, and cement dryers. From the reparations allocation of the PACD, centrifugal irrigation pumps, power tillers, marine diesel engines, and agricultural tractors have been sold to small farmers in Central Luzon on very liberal amortization plans.\r\nPACD fieldworkers throughout the country were directed to assist in the implementation of the P100-million Rural Improvement and Community Development Fund project.\r\nLast year, the Department of Social Welfare set up branch offices in the 10 newly created provinces, in Mt. Province, Davao, Agusan, Samar, Cotabato, and Misamis Oriental. The department also established two community centers in Manila, which gave vocational training to 10,000 out-of-school youth. With the support of the private sector, child-caring institutions were decentralized, while a Reception and StudyCenter was set up in Cagayan de Oro City. Three hundred seventy families with 2,653 dependents were given financial and technical aid to get them back on their feet.\r\nAllow me now to talk about the integrated program for social welfare. You will forgive my pride\u2014this is a program that has been called the First Lady\u2019s Integrated Social Welfare Program and would not have been possible but for the First Lady\u2019s determination, and a social conscience sensitized by all that she has seen of poverty and suffering in this country. We will not let politics or malice stand in the way of helping those who need help. For years, and through countless administrations, social workers had been trying to push through the idea of lifting welfare work in the Philippines above the level of rice and sardines. They spoke of decentralizing Welfareville, which had become, through laziness, inadequate funds, and sheer ignorance, the dumping ground of society\u2019s rejects. They dreamt of projects with lasting impact, programs and services whose returns might not be immediately discernible but which would help large sectors of the population adjust themselves to life\u2014I refer here to our dependent groups, of all ages: the abandoned, the orphaned, the handicapped, the disturbed, the aged, the poor, the sick\u2014but not until this administration came along did these dreamers find an advocate. Without a single exception, professional social workers speak of the integrated social program as a milestone, a breakthrough, moving relentlessly towards a reorientation of the entire welfare movement in our country. What is it? Put simply, it is a massive effort, tapping both government and private sources, to help the helpless, but not only in terms of simple food and shelter, but also of adjustment: where those who can, are taught skills that will help them become independent and responsible members of society; where those who can\u2019t, either by reason of age or of physical or emotional handicap, are given protection and sustenance but in an atmosphere of dignity.\r\nThe integrated program is, of necessity, a program of priorities\u2014because the children must be saved immediately, they have come first. Thus, the Nayon ng Kabataan at the Manila International Airport; the Reception and Study Center in Bago Bantay; the Marillac Hills project for girls. Work has begun on the MolaveVillage, a training school for boys in Tanay. Because they don\u2019t have long to live, and because we have a special affection for them, the aged will soon have a home near the Reception and StudyCenter in Bago Bantay. The pattern is unmistakable: As quickly as possible, Welfareville, long a byword for hopelessness, is being decongested, and its population moved out to the countryside where nothing is being spared, nothing that funds and technical knowledge can give, to provide them with a new hold on life.\r\nI invite my countrymen, particularly the Liberals, to visit these homes, and to see for themselves how much we can do and how far we can go, when we are driven not by self-aggrandizement but by the plaintive cry of the foundling and the orphan, the neglected, and the abandoned. The integrated social program does not stop here; when the children will have been taken care of, it will turn its attention to the mentally helpless, both young and old. We are determined to do everything for the NationalMental Hospital, and the mentally retarded children and the unfortunates in the barrios. Afterward, the preventive aspects of welfare work will have a share of attention\u2014projects will be put up for out-of-school youths; community programs and youth centers will receive greater support.\r\nOur small farmer-settlers, who have courageously dared the dangers and anxieties of frontier life, especially in Mindanao, as well as the cultural minorities with just and rightful claims to the lands of their ancestors, have been given greater protection and assistance. In the latter part of 1967, we created the Small Settlers Protection Committee by Executive Order. Since then, this committee has embarked on its assigned mission of protecting the rights of these settlers. Out of the 297 cases referred to the committee, 197 have been resolved. Its initial successes have brought up numerous other land cases, many of which are critical and fraught with grave social implications. Thus, recently we elevated the committee into a commission, headed by a full-time chairman.\r\nThe provincial small settlers protection committees will be greatly strengthened under the Small Farmers Commission. Cases of land-grabbing, exploitation of poor and ignorant settlers and cultural minorities by unscrupulous and powerful persons and entities, once brought to the attention of the commission, will be promptly investigated; the whole machinery of the government as well as the powers of the Presidency will be used to protect the rights of these pioneer farmers and to secure for them the assistance of appropriate government agencies.\r\nConsistent with the forest conservation requirements of the country, we have directed the Bureau of Forestry and the Bureau of Lands to speed up the reclassification of forest lands suitable to agriculture and to release these as alienable and disposable lands as soon as possible so that the legitimate desire of our landless citizens to own land and become independent farmers can be fulfilled.\r\nWe have likewise directed the Board of Liquidators to speed up distribution of former alien-owned lands and settlers\u2019 farms under the old LASEDECO. I am determined that the government under my administration shall move with utmost dispatch in fulfilling its responsibility to the landless.\r\nIn 1968, our Muslim brothers and the cultural minorities figured prominently in our overall development program. They were given preference in the allocation of prefabricated schoolhouses as well as in the release of the Barrio Development Fund. More scholarships were also awarded last year, especially for the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Sulu.\r\nOne of the immediate goals of this administration is to develop Mindanao. To attain that goal, we have recently revitalized the Mindanao Development Authority which will plan and direct the rational development of that vast fertile island.\r\nAt the same time, we have launched the Sulu development program and established the Mindanao and Sulu Development Commission, which coordinates all national agencies involved in the socioeconomic development of our southern islands. The Muslims and the other cultural minorities shall continue to receive preferential attention under this administration.\r\nIn planning for the future, we have given great importance to the countryside. Thus, for the first time in our history, there are now economic development plans for each municipality, province, and city. These are the municipal, provincial, and city economic atlases and development plans prepared by the Presidential Advisory Council on Public Works and Community Development (PACPWACD) in coordination with the local governments and with the assistance of technical agencies in the locality. All the 1,412 municipal mayors, 70 provincial governors, and 53 city mayors now have copies of these economic atlases.\r\nThe problem of maintaining peace and order is not a monopoly of the Philippines. It is a worldwide phenomenon that increases in intensity and extent as a society becomes a complex organism, as population increases, as peoples of varied cultures mingle and live together, as technology encroaches on traditional ways of life. These changes create not only the conditions for a better material life; they create, too, social problems, the most grievous of which are criminality and juvenile delinquency.\r\nAlthough the crime rate in the Philippines may appear intolerable, it is still among the lowest in the world. Crime in the United States, for instance, has increased by 58% since 1958; Canada by 16% from 1962 to 1965; Sweden by 39% from 1960 to 1965; and France by 44% for theft alone in 1965. Yet the police agencies in these countries are reputedly among the best trained and best equipped police forces in the world.\r\nIn Asia, India reported an increase of 37% in 1963; 20% for Hong Kong in 1965; 12% for South Korea on index crimes for every 100,000 inhabitants in 1964; 61% for Malaysia on index crimes in 1964; and 22% for Thailand on index crimes in 1964.\r\nIn sharp contrast, a study of the crime rate in the Philippines from 1962 to 1965 shows an increase of about 8%.\r\nIn 1966, the volume of crimes recorded was 18% higher than 1962. However, in 1968, the crime incidence registered a decrease of about 9% compared to 1966. Expressed in terms of crime rate, this means that the rate of crime incidence in 1966 was reduced by 14 counts for every 100,000 inhabitants in 1968. The reversal of the crime trend in 1968 is attributed to the reduction of crime in the Greater Manila Area as a consequence of the revitalization of the METROCOM and the establishment of a system of cooperation among law enforcement agencies in the metropolitan area.\r\nStatistics will show that for the period 1962 to 1965, about 77% of the total number of crimes were committed in Metropolitan Manila, and 13% in the rest of the country. In 1966 and 1967, the percentage of crime incidence in Metropolitan Manila went up to 82%, but dropped to 77% in 1968\u2014a level equal to that of 1962. A significant portion of this reduction was registered in index crimes. The percentage of these index crimes went down to 62% from 68% in 1962.\r\nThis is not to underestimate the seriousness of this problem, nor the deficiencies in our present law enforcement system. These are fully discussed in the so-called Walton Report, based on a survey which I asked to be made on representative police forces around the country.\r\nThe conclusions of the Walton Report were (1) the performance of many law enforcement agencies is substandard; (2) police training is inadequate; (3) political interference is common; (4) the facilities, budget, and logistical support are deficient; (5) inspection procedures are nonexistent or unsatisfactory; and (6) morale is low.\r\nIt is obvious that appropriate legislation had to be sought to solve these deficiencies, and the Police Act of 1966 can only be the first major step to upgrade and professionalize police departments all over the country under the supervision of the Police Commission.\r\nWe are well on the way to implementing the recommendations of the Walton Report.\r\nThe administration is resolving the crime problem through three major programs, namely: (1) improving our capability for crime prevention; (2) improving law enforcement; and (3) improving the administration of justice. The objective of these programs is to develop methods for dealing effectively with the crime problem.\r\nThe national government has been seriously hampered in developing a more effective peace and order program by the fact that peace and order has traditionally been the primary concern of local governments. This has set up limitations to its ability to take over responsibility for peace and order everywhere in the country.\r\nAt the same time, financing difficulties have prevented the procurement of adequate arms, vehicles, laboratory equipment, and other facilities, not to mention the need to increase police personnel in many places. To help reduce this problem, the Office of the President has time and again bought the equipment and other facilities of a number of police forces with savings in the Executive Department, but there is no specific appropriation for our police forces.\r\nThe administration anchors its peace and order programs on the concept of community action. While the national government is committed to provide leadership, coordination, technical and financial assistance, the local governments and the private sector are enjoined to respond in a manner that will ensure the success of the programs.\r\nOur program is intended (1) to arouse, promote, and maintain an active public concern for the prevention of crime and juvenile delinquency; (2) to integrate and coordinate the activities and projects of community organizations into the national crime prevention program; (3) to improve the caliber of the manpower resources of police agencies; (4) to develop interpolice agency teamwork and cooperation; (5) to win the support of the citizen in the peace and order campaign; (6) to make the judicial system more effective by introducing changes that will facilitate the processing of criminal cases; (7) to enhance the dignity of the courts by protecting the judiciary and the prosecuting agencies from pressure groups; (8) to eliminate the backlog of pending cases: and (9) to emphasize correctional treatment of prisoners, and to reduce recidivism by strengthening rehabilitation, counseling, educational, and vocational training activities.\r\nEvery possible measure is now being undertaken to improve police efficiency both on the provincial and municipal levels.\r\nIn addition to a national police academy at FortBonifacio, Rizal, regional training schools are now being established. Today, there are five such regional academies under the supervision of the POLCOM located in CebuCity, Cagayan de Oro, CampAquino in Tarlac, BacolodCity, and Lingayen. So far, 26 classes of the one-month chiefs of police course have graduated 1,141 chiefs of police, 118 deputy chiefs of police, and 922 other intermediate rank officers.\r\nTowards the end of 1968, a crash training program was inaugurated to give basic training to policemen in the lower grades as well as to recruits. The first group consisted of trainees from the police forces of Pampanga and Tarlac. Similar courses will be opened in 12 other training centers. The POLCOM has also trained 1,940 chairmen and members of local boards of investigators to upgrade and to systematize investigation procedures in administrative cases.\r\nThe crash training program will initially train 1,000 policemen each quarter. This number will be increased as facilities and funds are made available.\r\nHand in hand with this upgrading program is a rigid process which has been developed to remove misfits and undesirables in police forces. A total of 101 policemen have been dismissed with prejudice, 21 suspended, and 8 reprimanded or admonished in 239 cases acted upon by the POLCOM. The appalling state of police efficiency before corrective measures were undertaken is reflected in the fact that some 20,000 out of 30,000 policemen were not qualified to join the police force.\r\nThe modernization of police equipment, long overdue, is finally under way. The amount of P10 million was released for this purpose. This amount came from savings of the Executive Department because, as I have already stated, there were no funds provided for this purpose in the Appropriations Act. Already established is a Metropol Communications Network linking five cities and nine municipalities in the metropolitan area. Five municipalities in Rizal have also been helped to put up their communications systems. Technical surveys for setting up communications systems have already been completed in 10 provinces. In time, all these will become a nationwide network.\r\nThe Philippine Constabulary is still the national police. A program for the upgrading of its personnel has been under implementation since 1967. This effort was redoubled in 1968. Every member of the Philippine Constabulary is being trained in the detection, prevention, and investigation of crimes as well as the prosecution of criminal cases in court. Members of the force who do not meet these requirements will be weeded out or transferred to the Philippine Army. This is in addition to their training in public relations and in community development.\r\nUnlike previous stewards of our government, the present administration has, without fear or favor, punished grafters and corrupt public officials.\r\nIn recent months, I have ordered the dismissal or investigation of a district judge, a commissioner, a chief of police, a city judge, and other ranking government officials\r\nAdministrative reforms have been instituted, and more are being carried out, in the Bureaus of Customs and Internal Revenue, where the greatest incidence of graft and corruption may be found.\r\nThese have resulted in numerous suspensions and dismissals. Among the more prominent cases are the following.\r\nOn October 7, 1966, we ordered the suspension of two Customs officials and a Customs guard found involved in the illegal transfer of cargo, causing a loss of P50,000 to the government. The Customs personnel who were suspended were Rodolfo Espino, acting chief of the manufacturing warehouses; Cesar Santos, assistant commissioner for operations and concurrently chairman of Cargo Inventory and Disposal Committee; and Edgardo de los Santos, a guard. Administrative charges had been filed against the two officials and the guard by Gen. Pelagio Cruz, the head of the Anti-SmugglingActionCenter.\r\nOn November 28, 1966, we ordered the suspension of Health Undersecretary Rodolfo Canos upon the recommendation of the special committee that investigated the charges against this official. He was found guilty of willful neglect of duty, grave abuse of authority, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. He was dismissed from the service on August 10, 1967.\r\nOn March 30, 1967, we suspended for three months Judge Alfredo C. Mabayad of the municipal court of Roxas, Isabela, after he was found guilty of gross negligence and dereliction of duty.\r\nOn July 27, 1967, we ordered the preventive suspension of Capts. Vicente M. Orlina and Arturo llagan and Crisanto G. Almoguera, members of the Board of Examiners for Marine Engineers, who were held responsible for the leakage of questions for an examination given in Cebu City. They had been administratively charged by Commissioner Abelardo Subido for bribery.\r\nOn August 14, 1967, we suspended for one year Fiscal Carlo Lozada of Surigao del Norte for improper conduct, arising from charges of oppression and harassment. He was also sternly warned that repetition of the offense would be dealt with more severely.\r\nOn September 19, 1967, we suspended Governor Javier Ariosa of Zamboanga del Sur, who was found guilty of charges of oppression, dishonesty, and grave misconduct.\r\nOn January 6, 1968, we suspended and later dismissed from office District Judge Gaudencio Cloribel of Manila.\r\nOn March 16, 1968, we suspended Land Registration Commissioner Antonio Nohlejas on grounds of \u201cgross negligence and acts prejudicial to the public interest\u201d for approving subdivision plans based on the new surveys that encroached into public lands. His resignation was accepted later.\r\nOn April 27, 1968, we fired Chairman Tomas Martin, Board Members William Buquid and Rene Garcia of the Board of Liquidators for abuse of presidential confidence in the disposal of the 15,925,545 shares of the government in the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company.\r\nOn July 25, 1966, we fired Provincial Fiscal Geminiano Beloso of Batangas for the loss of over 5,000 cartons of smuggled cigarettes placed in his custody as evidence in the case. The Department of Justice found him guilty of dishonesty and incompetence.\r\nOn August 28, 1966, we ordered the dismissal of Provincial Fiscal Juan Salazar and Assistant Fiscal Eliezer Tengco, both of Laguna. Administrative charges were filed against them for dishonesty, misconduct, and dereliction of duty while prosecuting a smuggling case involving 7,600 cartons of blue seal cigarettes.\r\nOn November 11, 1966, we were informed of the dismissal of nine SSS employees for venalities ranging from dishonesty to immorality. SSS Administrator Gilberto Teodoro pointed out in his report that although the SSS is outside the civil service, the system is applying civil service procedures to employees facing administrative charges to assure them due process and to remove suspicion of arbitrariness on the part of the SSS management. Teodoro said that 79 administrative cases have been brought against SSS employees. Forty-two have already been fired as of November 10, 1966.\r\nOn March 29, 1967, we ordered the dismissal of the three municipal judges, namely: Fernando B. Fuentes Jr. of Nunungan. Lanao del Norte; Crispin N. Menchavez of Santa Fe, Cebu; and Vicente M. Salumbides of Tagkawayan, Quezon, who were found guilty of dishonesty, dereliction of duty, and gross ignorance of the law. On April 1, 1967, we fired Horacio T. Aquino, municipal judge of Panganiban, Catanduanes; and Eloy David, municipal judge of Clark Field, Pampanga. Investigation conducted by a district judge found Judge Aquino guilty of grave misconduct and habitual drunkenness. Judge David was found by investigators guilty of gross incompetence and ignorance of the elementary rules of court procedures.\r\nOn May 16, 1967, we ordered the dismissal of Davao Chief of Police Monebrio F. Abellana, on the recommendation of Solicitor General Antonio Barredo, who investigated charges against him and who found him guilty of all charges brought against him except toleration of gambling.\r\nOn June 23, 1967, we fired Judge Pascual Beltran of the Municipal Court of Buenavista, Iloilo, and Judge Pedro San Roque of the Municipal Court of Virac, Catanduanes, for serious misconduct and inefficiency. Their cases were investigated by District Judge Feliciano Gonzales of the Court of First Instance of Catanduanes, and the findings were reviewed by then Undersecretary Claudio Teehankee.\r\nOn June 24, 1967, we dismissed two municipal judges and suspended another. We dismissed Abstenencio Lobitana of Domangig, Zamboanga del Sur Peace Court and Romeo Laurente of the Matab-ob, Leyte Peace Court, who were both found guilty of the administrative charges filed against them. And we suspended for three months without pay Municipal Judge Lorenzo Tecson of SanMiguel, Bulacan Peace Court for ignorance of the law and for issuing \u201can unjust interlocutory case for robbery.\u201d\r\nOn August 13, 1967, we dismissed Provincial Treasurer Hadji Urang Naga, who was found guilty of gross negligence, incurring unauthorized overdrafts, and misuse of trust funds.\r\nOn August 24, 1967, we removed from office Municipal Judge Daniel O. Osumo of Kibawe, Bukidnon, after investigations by District Judge Abundo Z. Ameta revealed that Osumo had taken long, unauthorized leaves.\r\nOn October 7, 1967, we ordered the dismissal of Leocadio A. Vargas, mayor of Mainit, Surigao del None, for neglect of duties amounting to abandonment of his post.\r\nOn October 11, 1967, we dismissed Fifth Assistant Fiscal Salvador Macainan of Bacolod City for gross misconduct and abandonment of office. The administrative order removing Macainan from his office took note of the fact that Macainan is one of the several persons charged with murder in Negros Occidental Court of First Instance.\r\nOn November 18, 1967, we ordered the immediate dismissal of Jacinto R. Acaling, register of deeds of Aklan, for unexplained shortage in collections and unauthorized absence from his post.\r\nOn November 30, 1967, we ordered the dismissal of City Engineer Godotredo Trinchera of OrmocCity, who was found guilty of malversation of funds, illegal use of government property, and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.\r\nOn March 5, 1968, we fired Judge Gregorio D. Montejo of Zamboanga City on recommendation of the Supreme Court. He was found guilty of ignorance of the law and of advancing his personal interest through his office.\r\nOn March 22, 1968, we were informed by POLCOM Chairman Crispinode Castro that he dismissed Chief of Police Genaro C. Ferrer of Binmaley, Pangasinan; Balbino Ibana of Talisay, Cainarines Norte; Deputy Chief of Police Marcefo Abad of Gingoog City; Corporal Emeriano Bonifacio of Binmaley, Pangasinan; and Corporal Enrique Parungao of Gapan, Nueva Ecija.\r\nOn January 18, 1969, we ordered the dismissal of Municipal Judge Eligio C. Dajao of Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental; and the suspension for six months of Assistant City Fiscal Felizardo L. Espino of RoxasCity. Judge Dajao was found guilty of negligence and ignorance of the law in the disposition of certain criminal cases brought before his sala. Fiscal Espino was found guilty of serious dereliction of duty.\r\nOn January 18, 1969, we ordered the dismissal of Municipal Judge Arturo A. Glagara of Talisay, Negros Occidental, for improper conduct, partially in the disposition of cases, and gross dereliction of duty.\r\nFriends and political allies have been treated with equal severity.\r\nThere are 577 antigraft cases filed with the Presidential Agency on Reforms and Government Operations alone. Of these, 113 are under current investigation, 3 are pending preliminary investigation in different fiscals\u2019 offices, 4 have been filed in the proper courts, 19 have been considered closed, and the rest are pending in the agency\u2019s dockets.\r\nThe Department of Justice has organized five special antigraft groups to speed up the investigation and prosecution of graft cases, especially in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Bureau of Customs, Bureau of Treasury, Insurance Commission, and the Bureau of Posts.\r\nIn the past, the attitude of the government towards graft and corruption oscillated between mock horror and toleration. Despite loud declarations to fight graft and corruption, the previous administration never even bothered to look into this grave problem.\r\nTo remove even the shadow of secrecy from any government transaction, we have invited the opposition party to send a representative to the Cabinet Bidding Committee. The function of this body is to review and to approve all contracts entered into by the government. The opposition party had earlier refused this invitation. We appeal to them to reconsider this unaccountable stand.\r\nOur actions prove that we are determined to go after grafters and corrupt government officials. We encourage the citizens to participate in our campaign against graft and corruption by reporting all cases of immorality, dishonesty, and venality in the public service to my office.\r\nIf these complaints are substantiated, then swift and decisive action will be taken.\r\nIn addition to these, the government last year initiated or expanded several special programs. Accomplishments in these areas were noteworthy.\r\nThe Board of Investments came into operation last year, as authorized by Republic Act 5186, and has had a very successful first year of operation. The First Investment Priorities Plan was published and approved by the National Economic Council and the President, and supporting administrative orders and regulations were promulgated. In response to this first enumeration of the priority areas of investment and in only half a year, applications were received with a total project cost of more than P2.9 billion, a total which it had been thought would require at least a full year to attain. Of more than 140 applications for registration as a preferred enterprise, about 53 have so far been approved.\r\nA Presidential Task Force on Urban Development has begun operations and has chosen as initial pilot areas the cities of Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Legaspi, and Baguio.\r\nAt the same time that we sought to bring down unemployment and to provide security to labor, we recognized as a correlative and equally important concern the housing of our expanding population and the rehabilitation of our cities. These problems are relatively new to our society, but these have increasingly become areas of grave concern in our national plans and goals.\r\nAccordingly, the administration mapped out an integrated program of urban renewal, with the various government agencies involved as the key to its implementation. These agencies were the People\u2019s Homesite and Housing Corporation, the Department of Social Welfare, the Social Security System, and the Government Service Insurance System.\r\nMuch of the work was concentrated in the urban sectors of the country where people have tended to congregate in ever-increasing number. The combined resources of government agencies made possible the relocation and resettlement of the urban poor as well as the extension of low-cost housing assistance to the low-salaried middle class. We have succeeded in a limited way in clearing our ghettos, and helped ameliorate the lives of resettled slum dwellers.\r\nHousing was not given full attention in the past because of the priority requirements and exigencies of industrial and agricultural development. Now that some progress has been attained in the basic areas, we can include housing in our programs.\r\nAs everybody knows, housing continues to be a serious national problem. The housing needs of the country, if spread out over a 20-year period, would be about 470,000 dwelling units a year, computed at 100,000 units in urban areas and 370,000 in rural areas. Viewed in the light of past performance and present capabilities of both the government and private sectors, the requirement assumes discouraging proportions. Nevertheless, something must be done if we are to prevent the degeneration of urban centers into slum squatters areas.\r\nIn 1968, we launched a novel nationwide housing program designed to benefit simultaneously both low-income and middle-income sectors of the population.\r\nThis program is a departure from traditional housing programs of government institutions, which usually finance both lots and buildings within subdivision areas or \u201cprojects.\u201d\r\nThe cost of the houses should be from P5,000 for the lowest-cost units to P25,000, payable in 25 years at 6% interest and without any down payment.\r\nThe program, therefore, will be free from the limitations of project-type housing which, among other disadvantages, involves huge outlays of funds for land acquisition, development, sales, administration, and maintenance. It is also seen as a big step towards the reorientation of the Filipino attitude towards complete individuality in housing, a factor that has prevented the population from benefiting from economies of scale resulting from mass production of prefabricated units. Eventually, it is also expected to clear the path for private enterprise to take over or assume a more active role in urban and housing development.\r\nThe economic and social impact of this program cannot be gainsaid. The extensive use of locally manufactured and fabricated construction materials, such as cement, coupled with the use of Philippine labor, will generate higher productivity and incomes.\r\nThe average- or low-income citizen can then be given the opportunity to own real property of such quality and durability that will not only satisfy his and his family\u2019s needs but will give him a feeling of belonging and security.\r\nSince some questions have been raised about the means to implement this program, I ask Congress to help salvage a laudable project that is urgently needed by our people.\r\nWe began last year, in cooperation with the World Bank a thorough survey of our transportation system.\r\nGood transportation is a basic requirement of a developing country; but much of our transport system has suffered from past neglect and inefficient operation. In the case of government-supplied facilities, the main bottleneck has been shortage of funds. We have been trying, in connection with our infrastructure program, to define our transportation needs as precisely as possible and to operate a program as efficiently as we possibly can.\r\nThere is perhaps no sight more pathetic than the sight of a farmer tilling a patch of ground for someone else. For years, under a system which bound him perpetually to the landlord and the usurer, the Filipino farmer labored and toiled without any hope of breaking his feudal bonds. With the passage or the Land Reform Code, however, hope glimmered at last. But the transition from congressional act to actuality was painfully slow. By the end or the previous administration, only 12 municipalities had been placed under land reform, involving some 13,000 palay farmers cultivating an area of 35,147.10 hectares.\r\nFor land reform to be meaningful, more areas must be placed under its protective mantle. Soon after assuming office in 1966, we proclaimed the entire 2nd District of Pampanga, comprising 12 municipalities, as a land reform area. In February 1968, 22 towns in Nueva Ecija were placed under land reform. And in September 1968, 11 towns and 1 city in the 1st District of Laguna also became a land reform area. And so today, land reform covers 60 municipalities and 2 cities in 12 provinces, and involves 86,939 farmers.\r\nTo speed up the transition of lessees into owner-cultivators, the Land Bank has purchased 12 landed estates in the plains of Central Luzon comprising 3,739 hectares costing more than eight-and-a-half million pesos. Twenty-two landed estates covering an area of 3,064 hectares are under negotiation. And 85 landed estates covering 14,000 hectares are being surveyed for possible acquisition.\r\nBut we have been partially paralyzed by the lack of a source of funds. Congress eliminated the provisions that established the source of financing of land reform operations when it passed the Land Reform Code. We are asking Congress for funds to finance land reform, but as an alternative we plan to sell FortBonifacio, CampAguinaldo, CampCrame, and other government properties in the four cities of the metropolitan area. FortBonifacio could bring in P500 million and Camp Aguinaldo another P500 million. The money will be used for land reform operations and to boost agricultural productivity in land reform areas.\r\nAs a corollary to the leasehold system and eventual land ownership, we have slopped up our resettlement program. We consider it our prime social responsibility to provide land to those displaced by urban and industrial development.\r\nWe have, as an example, resettled squatter families from the East Triangle in Quezon City to a settlement project in San Pedro, Laguna. We have also opened virgin lands in Central Visayas, Mindanao, and Palawan for more than 1,542 farm families from Luzon. The settlement projects of the Land Authority now cover an area of 383,603 hectares, divided into 29,709 farm lots. In these projects, 23,574 families, including Muslims, were resettled.\r\nPalay production in the land reform projects for the regular crop year of 1967-1968 averaged as much as 77 cavans per hectare, or an increase of 37.6 cavans over the preproclamation figure at 39.4 to a hectare. This represents a 94.4% increase. Production in the palugad increased by 28 cavans per hectare, from 33 to 61 cavans, or by 84.4%, over the figure prior to proclamation. This is undeniable proof that a breakthrough in agricultural productivity can be achieved through land reform.\r\nOver the decades, the government has pursued an erratic policy in Central Luzon; at one extreme, a policy of suppression; at another, a policy of appeasement and accommodation for the Huks. Neither policy has coped with the deep-rooted problems of the region; in fact, the problems have grown from bad to worse, erupting now and then into lawlessness, violence, and bloodshed. We have discarded these extremist policies and replaced them with a sustained program of social justice and accelerated economic development and a policy of firmness and fairness in dealing with subversive elements.\r\nWe have launched our Central Luzon Development Program, which called for an increase of 35% in services and resources committed by 27 government agencies in Central Luzon. The outcome of this program has been spectacular. According to Governor Francisco Nepomuceno of Pampanga, this administration has done more for Central Luzon in so short a time than all the previous administrations put together. At the same time, through our policy of firmness in dealing with subversive elements, we have crushed the Huk cadres in Central Luzon, thereby creating a situation in which negative and sterile military operations can now give way to creative civilian activities. All this was accomplished without any curtailment of the liberties of the citizens.\r\nSome of the notable accomplishments in Central Luzon in 1968:\r\nIn agricultural productivity, P38,986,757.03 in loans was released by the ACA to hundreds of thousands of farmers. From July to November 1968 alone, a total of P9,683,168.87 was issued to 18,848 farmer-borrowers. On the other hand, Central Bank-sponsored loans totaling P128,191,612 were released to 757,536 farmers for farm production, farm mechanization, poultry, fish culture, irrigation pumps and engines, and the development of private irrigation systems. In addition, P12,314,621 was released in commercial loans to 10,488 persons, P3,149,465 in industrial loans to 2,961 persons and P168,900 in other loans to 528 persons. At the same time, 276,250 bags of fertilizers valued at P3,892,400 were distributed in the area. Moreover, 4,215,771 animals were vaccinated, hundreds of thousands of vials of free drugs and biologics were distributed; thousands of cavans of certified seeds, especially the high-yield varieties were procured and distributed; 196,790.83 hectares were surveyed for soil conservation and 637 hectares for topography.\r\nIn public works and water resources development, 1,290 pumps irrigating 32,052 hectares were installed, while 765 artesian wells were either set up or repaired; 113,999,802 kilometers of concrete, asphalt and feeder roads were built while 999,152 lineal meters of bridges were constructed; the Pampanga River Irrigation System in Talavera, Nueva Ecija, irrigating 23,500 hectares and costing P885,000 was completed, while 26 communal irrigation projects irrigating 9,625 hectares were finished, and 54 irrigation pump units irrigating 10,149 hectares were rehabilitated.\r\nIn health, 2,320,636 persons were vaccinated; 474,829 mothers and children were extended health services; 11,417 potable water supply and sanitary toilets were constructed, while the ArayatEmergencyHospital, the BaliwagEmergencyHospital, and the San Miguel Emergency Hospital were activated.\r\nIn education, 1,178 new schoolbuildings, mostly of the Marcos-type, were distributed and installed; study seminars on the planting of high-yield rice varieties were conducted.\r\nIn the administration of justice, 682 cases were terminated and legal assistance was extended to 11,898 farmers.\r\nIn labor, 2,205 agricultural establishments involving 39,360 farmworkers were inspected to insure compliance with the Land Reform Code and other labor laws, and payment of P1,442,612 in various benefits was effected in favor of 1,500 workers.\r\nIn social welfare, P327,000 was doled out to indigent families in the area.\r\nWe will continue to support private industry.\r\nPreliminary studies by the Board of Investments have revealed the extent of our industrialization. It has also shown some areas in which the administration of incentives can be improved and other areas in which new incentives should be granted, and I commend these areas to the attention of Congress.\r\nFirst, although export industries are already granted the highest incentives under the present law, there is still a need for a special export incentives law. The extensive damage done on some of our leading export crops by typhoons late last year has shown once again how important exports are to our economy, and how fragile this link to prosperity can be if it continues to be based on agricultural crops that are subject to the whims of weather. A method of achieving the export of manufacturers which has been found useful by several developing countries is the creation of an export processing zone. A proposal for such a zone is already before Congress. I again invite your attention to it, and recommend its passage.\r\nAnother means for improving our foreign trade balance is also before Congress: the omnibus tariff bill. Since it will contribute substantially to the solution of our largest remaining economic problem, I believe it requires prompt attention. In pursuit of our international economic policy, especially negotiating on a multilateral basis, it would be to our advantage to have an updated Tariff Code. If it cannot be passed in toto, then the provisions regarding the tariff negotiating powers of the President should be enacted as a separate piece of legislation.\r\nSecond, another path to industrialization which has been insufficiently pursued is the growth of small industries. Our government financial institutions and the Board of Investments have rightly centered their attention on large investments, because this is the way in which their efforts and resources can be most economically employed. However, the medium and heavy industries resulting from these investments will spawn a set of small satellite industries for which the present cottage industries law makes no provision. These small industries should be promoted, both to fill the gaps in our industrial structure and to encourage the growth and spreading of entrepreneurship. Accordingly, we are directing the Department of Commerce and Industry to pay particular attention to the problems of small industries.\r\nThird, as industrial enterprises grow and spread in the regions outside Manila, there will be a growing demand for cheap electric power. This cannot be met by the present town franchises unless the present restrictions to their expansion are removed. There should be legislation allowing the interconnection of public utility franchises.\r\nFourth, a long-standing national aim was once again enunciated in the Investment Incentives Law: the regional dispersal of industry. For this purpose, certain activities of the regional development authorities should be placed under the Board of Investments, particularly those relating to the establishment of project priorities. The board should also be empowered to grant differential incentives for certain regions. These modifications would work to the mutual benefit of the board and the regional authorities. The board would be better informed of the regional developments, and regional projects would receive the additional support in the national industrial plan.\r\nFinally, the present structure of production taxes hinders the integration of industry. It is disadvantageous to produce domestically certain industrial components, such as car components, because the sum of the taxes imposed at different stages of processing amounts to more than the duty on the importation of the finished products. Thus, backward integration is discouraged. Similarly, forward integration is discouraged in the field of mining because producers integrating forward pay a sales tax on a base which includes taxes previously paid in prior processing, whereas a mere exporter of mineral ores pays only the 1-1/2% ad valorem tax. Such inconsistencies in our tax laws should be removed by imposing the taxes on value added only, thus permitting deduction of taxes already paid.\r\nWe have made significant gains in the major areas. To sustain the momentum of the gains, new measures and new courses of action are necessary. I therefore propose the following.\r\nI propose the creation of a presidential commission to study the possibility of major changes in our governmental system to eliminate obstacles to our growth and make our democratic institutions more responsive to the needs of rapid and orderly development and of social justice. I call on Congress to participate in this effort.\r\nI propose that Congress look into the possibility of strengthening the law on premature electioneering by increasing the penal sanctions against offenders.\r\nI have ordered the implementation of the 5% increase of the salaries of all government employees on July 1 this year. There is an appropriation for this increase but the government does not have the cash to implement it. To meet this commitment to the employees of the government, I have ordered a 10% reduction of expenditures in all departments. This reduction is on top of the P200-million savings on government expenditures which I have also imposed for the coming fiscal year.\r\nI propose a new deal through legislation for our public school teachers.\r\nI am recommending the establishment of a trust fund from which can be drawn increases in teachers\u2019 salaries, cost of living allowances, and other fringe benefits. The trust fund for teachers may be started with an initial P5 million from the Department of Finance. This money and its earnings can then be used for the benefit of our teachers.\r\nWe will meet the special problems of teachers in chartered cities by authorizing local sources of funds (perhaps by increasing their share of the excess in income tax) to be used to improve the status and income of the teachers.\r\nI propose that we look seriously into the possibility of opening up for public school teachers adequate channels through which to communicate their grievances. A grievance procedure on the school level and on the national level should be developed. This will democratize relationships in the teaching profession and will encourage new habits of independence, self-reliance, and responsibility on the part of the teachers. They, in turn, will communicate these new attitudes to their students, to a new generation of Filipinos.\r\nWe welcome the new, purposeful militancy and dynamism of our youth and students. We must enlist their energies, their talents, and their idealism to the cause of orderly progress and change, to the cause of expanding freedom and welfare for all our people.\r\nI therefore direct the Department of Education to establish immediately a method for hearing and acting on the grievances of our youth and students.\r\nI ask the Department of Education to intervene in student and youth strikes and demonstrations and explore way sand means of realizing their constructive and reasonable demands.\r\nAt the same time, I am creating a national youth commission which shall advise the President on youth and student affairs. The commission shall also be the main vehicle for the participation of youth and students in the formulation of public policies.\r\nMoreover, I propose that steps be taken to open the way for the membership of a representative of the student body in the Board of Regents of every government college or university, including the University of the Philippines.\r\nI propose the establishment of a P3-million permanent trust fund, the earnings of which will finance the expenses of student organizations, including those for student welfare projects and student-sponsored civic action projects. This fund will be managed by a board with a majority of civic leaders and students.\r\nI propose passage of a Magna Carta for students. Through this, we will manifest the fullest encouragement and support for a new role in the new society we are building.\r\nWe must meet the problem of the huge textbook shortage, improve the quality of these books and the manner of distributing them.\r\nI propose the creation of a textbook commission for this purpose. I propose the upgrading of the quality of education by inculcating professionalism and raising the quality of teachers, among others by stricter supervision of teacher training and by entrusting the examination of teachers to educators sitting as a board of examiners.\r\nI propose to correct and rectify deficiencies in our educational system.\r\nThe growth of barrio high schools has been phenomenal. Starting with only four schools in 1964, there are today, under a policy of encouragement of this administration, 1,200 barrio high schools all over the country, employing some 6,000 teachers and providing instruction to 120,000 students.\r\nThe establishment of barrio high schools has contributed greatly to the reduction of the number of dropouts from both the grade schools and the high schools. The rate of dropouts before my administration was estimated at 59%.\r\nExisting regular high schools cannot possibly accommodate all the graduates from elementary schools. There are only 279 regular high schools in the country today.\r\nWe must, by legislation, support the barrio high schools and remove any doubts as to its legality as an institution.\r\nTo insure the financial autonomy and institutional independence of the University of the Philippines, I invite Congress to consider the possibility of providing through tax measures a special fund for the support of the University of the Philippines which is at present subsidized by the national government to the extent of 46% of the UP budget.\r\nI also invite Congress to consider proposals coming from the constituents of the university itself for the revision of its fundamental law, the University Charter that dates back to 1908. The restructuring of the StateUniversity will have to be consistent with the constitutional guarantee of academic freedom for state universities and the principles of self-determination that the UP faculty and students now invoke.\r\nI propose the establishment of more science high schools to meet the need for technically trained manpower as we modernize our economy.\r\nI propose that new sources of revenue be provided to finance the legitimate requirements of our people for improved living conditions. The responsibility for providing the means is yours. The task of using the means you provide, in the manner you indicate, for the service of our people, will be mine.\r\nI propose that we now study and systematize the sources of government financing and their proper allocations, including the present classification of special funds.\r\nI propose to cut at least P200 million from the budgetary proposal for the coming fiscal year. This is the same amount I have directed all departments to save from the budget of the current fiscal year.\r\nI propose that Congress now act immediately on all bills pending before it for the improvement of the tax collecting machinery of government, including the consolidated bill on the Internal Revenue Code, the omnibus amendments on the Tariff and Customs Code, especially those pertaining to the removal of escape clauses and ambiguous provisions in both codes and such ambiguous terms as \u201cand others\u201d in the classification of goods for purposes of taxation and tariff duties.\r\nIf the importers will not voluntarily do so, I propose a complete and immediate embargo on all luxury and nonessential goods. The continuous and unrestricted importation of such goods strains our foreign reserves, corrupts the tastes of our people, and diminishes our capital resources for the development of agriculture and industry.\r\nOn the moral plane, this will promote disciplined living among the citizenry, especially among the more affluent and more fortunate.\r\nTo minimize the outflow of dollars and to channel local investible funds into domestic enterprises, I propose a tax on foreign stocks, land, and buildings acquired abroad by residents of the Philippines.\r\nThe present tariff rates should be assessed and revised to promote industrialization. More particularly, the approach should now concentrate on the encouragement of industries producing intermediate and capital goods and raw materials. We now produce many of the things we used to import.\r\nI propose the restudy of the present restrictive measures adopted by the Monetary Board, including CB Circular No. 265 which requires the declaration and limitation of the amount of foreign exchange and local currency that can be brought out by travelers leaving the Philippines.\r\nI propose that we increase the available dollars for imports by allowing commercial banks to use their existing acceptance lines for financing imports with advance exchange cover. This will increase our available dollars for imports by at least $200 million.\r\nI propose that domestic importers be given inducements to finance their imports from trade credits available directly from their suppliers whether the importers are independent companies or subsidiaries of foreign corporations.\r\nI call on subsidiaries of all foreign corporations operating in the Philippines to suspend, at least for this year, their remittances of profits in dollars to their mother companies, especially when they have domestic indebtedness.\r\nI propose that Congress define exactly the areas in which we are prepared to extend temporary national treatment to foreigners, and the areas in which we are willing to give only most-favored-nation treatment.\r\nI propose that the government review its present schemes of financial assistance to private industry to favor Filipino capital and, at the same time, discourage the importation of nonessential goods and encourage the fuller development of domestic processing or industrialization of our agricultural products. Also, there must be a serious reappraisal of the premises upon which protection is granted to \u201cinfant industries.\u201d It must be stressed that protection to this type of industries can be granted only on a case-to-case basis and will be firmly based on either profitability or ability to adapt to local conditions.\r\nI propose the creation of a special fund for peace and order.\r\nI also propose to integrate all police agencies of Manila and suburban areas under a Metropolitan Area Command patterned after Scotland Yard.\r\nI propose that Congress examine the possibility of giving the national government more latitude to step into the peace and order problems on the local level, which is now denied it. This will give a new flexibility to our national police force in coping with stubborn criminality in specific localities.\r\nI propose that we now provide the necessary funds for the activation of the seven new branches of the Court of Appeals.\r\nI propose that branches of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Agrarian Relations be established in various regions of the country to speed up the disposition of cases before them. The regionalization of these courts will progressively clear their backlog, while affording citizens in the provinces easier and less expensive access to them.\r\nThe administration of justice requires careful study and analysis of facts. I propose the establishment of a research and advisory staff for every Court of First Instance to assist the presiding judges in arriving at well-informed and just decisions.\r\nThe backlog of untried and undecided cases in the Courts of First Instance must be prevented from increasing further. I propose that judges of Courts of First Instance with an unreasonable number of undecided cases be denied the privilege of being reassigned to another jurisdiction until they have cleared their dockets.\r\nI propose the enactment of a law defining the guidelines for the creation of private corporations for a public purpose. There is no dispute about the urgency of establishing such corporations in the light of the requirements of development and public service. Some doubts have been raised about the legality of such corporations. We have no doubt about the legal authority of government financial institutions to create such corporations under the law on corporations and the Constitution. However, questions have been raised regarding the propriety as a matter of policy of government institutions exercising such powers. To enable the Executive department to plan freely and systematically the creation of such corporations, as the need for them arises, I urge Congress to enact a law setting forth the guidelines for their establishment at the earliest opportunity.\r\nAn export incentives bill should be enacted granting the following incentives: (1) deduction of organization and preoperating expenses; (2) net operating loss carryover; (3) double deduction of expenses incurred for production, research, and development; (4) double deduction of export promotion expenses; (5) deduction of shipping costs to the extent of 125%; (6) tax credits on domestic components of exported products; and (7) deduction of salaries of personnel who are newly hired and under training to the extent of 125% of their actual salary although such deduction should be reduced over a period of three years. This will help reduce our unemployment.\r\nI propose a law authorizing the President to designate export processing zones where foreign-made articles and manufacturing or processing equipment may enter the country tax- and duty-free. Taxes and custom duties, however, shall be collected under the following circumstances: (1) withdrawal of materials from the zone for use in the Philippines; and (2) sale of finished products in the domestic market with deductions for cost of domestic raw materials.\r\nAccelerated manpower development attuned to the needs of rapid economic growth and the solution of unemployment must be a permanent endeavor of government. I therefore urge that the manpower development bill pending in Congress be immediately passed.\r\nI propose that we change the entire orientation of our public housing policy to suit the needs of the minimum wage workers. Let us start building houses for the poor. The government should be able to produce housing at not more than P5,000 each unit payable in 25 years at 6% interest and without any down payment. This will open the program to every laborer.\r\nIn line with this policy, the SSS, the GSIS, the DBP, the PHHC, and the National Housing Corporation have already shifted the emphasis of their housing programs to low-cost housing. This policy will be pursued vigorously in the coming years.\r\nI propose the establishment of a workable unemployment insurance scheme to be administered jointly by the Social Security System and the Department of Labor.\r\nI propose the creation of a workers bank, with the GSIS and the SSS providing the seed capital. This bank shall be owned by the workers and shall attend to their urgent credit requirements.\r\nI have directed the Department of Labor to reactivate its public defender function, and I ask Congress to vote the necessary funds so that that department can acquire the personnel needed to extend tree legal aid to the indigent population. This service is now limited only to househelp. It should be made available to all the needy people seeking justice.\r\nI propose the revitalization of tourism through the establishment of a national tourist commission to supplant present agencies engaged in tourist industry development.\r\nI recommend that the appropriation of the RCA be increased to P40 million a year to enable it to support rice production.\r\nI further recommend that a sum sufficient to liquidate long-overdue obligations of the RCA to the Philippine National Bank be appropriated. The payment of these debts, which arose out of previous rice importations, can be effected through a refinancing scheme.\r\nEnormous economic loss is suffered by the country each year because of frequent and destructive typhoons. Similar loss is suffered from droughts. This must be minimized. I propose that Congress and the Executive adopt as a basic policy that investments in agriculture from now on be as much as possible concentrated below the typhoon belt.\r\nI propose that Congress pass without further delay the Medicare bill. About 82% of our people are medically indigent. If there is a consensus that we cannot afford a too ambitious program, we can begin with certain pilot areas. We can extend the coverage as we go along.\r\nI pointed out earlier that the Mindanao Development Authority has been revived and strengthened to harness fully the economic potentials of this great region. I propose to authorize it to borrow money from foreign sources to finance major turnkey projects.\r\nI propose that steps be taken to accelerate the electrification of Mindanao for which feasibility surveys have already been completed with the help of the USAID. The electrification of the rural areas should be a major concern of our government. I ask Congress to review and update the existing laws on power distribution so that cheap power may be extended to all the people. The obsolete franchise system should be reexamined.\r\nI propose that we muster the will and the funds to declare Central Luzon as a land reform area by 1969. This will come as the long-promised social revolution in this pivotal region.\r\nWe shall initiate immediately a program to remove our major military camps from the metropolitan area to new sites farther from the centers of population. I ask that congressional authority be granted to sell the lands now occupied by FortBonifacio, CampAguinaldo, CampCrame, and other government properties in the four cities of the metropolitan area.\r\nThe proceeds will constitute a huge fund to finance massive and nationwide land reform and the modernization of our agriculture.\r\nI propose that the opposition party, through a chosen representative, participate in the deliberations of the Cabinet Bidding Committee. I have made this invitation before; I reiterate it in the hope that the opposition party will see the importance of accepting this challenge to protect the public interest.\r\nI propose the fuller development of the concept of self-reliant national defense featured by a steady emphasis on highly mobile and versatile special forces.\r\nI propose that we accelerate the review of treaties and agreements between the Philippines and other countries. Some features of these treaties and agreements go against the national interest. We should rectify them at once.\r\nAnd finally, I propose that we establish trade and cultural relations with the countries of Eastern Europe.\r\nI have sought to compress into a kind of ordered perspective the problems and the opportunities, the advances and the setbacks that we have experienced. I submit that in the past three years, the achievements of our people in partnership with the government may well represent, in the eyes of history, a cutoff point from the prolonged impotence of our past and the beginning of a new experience of self-reliance, competence, and self-esteem for the Filipino people and their government.\r\nI submit that during this brief time we have realized, to a significant extent, the prophecy of Rizal that a Filipino of a new type would emerge from this land within a century from the time he wrote it. This New Filipino prophesied by Rizal in his \u201cThe Philippines: A Century Hence\u201d about a century ago has now risen full blown from the loam of history. He has taken command of our nation\u2019s destiny in various spheres of life. The new Filipino man brims over with the creative and purposeful spirit, sees problems not as obstacles but as opportunities for achievement, eagerly engages problems and challenges, and views the future as a challenge of greatness.\r\nThe New Filipino symbolizes the extinction of Juan Tamad as the undeserved archetype of the Filipino race and the emergence of a new type of Filipino more competent, more confident, more eager for challenge and achievement than all his ancestors before him. In this respect, he eclipses the pre-Spanish Filipinos whom Morga praised for their courage, industry, and independence before colonialism corrupted and enfeebled their spirit. And he matches the vision and the independence with which his ancestors, in 1898, founded the FirstRepublic in the history of Asia as well as the courage of the defenders of Bataan, Corregidor, and the resistance movement.\r\nThe experience of the past three years, combining a number of small and big breakthroughs in our national life, shows that the central factor for our progress is still the Filipino; that the Filipino transformed means a nation transformed; that the limit of what we can achieve for ourselves are fundamentally a matter of character\u2014a moral and spiritual limitation.\r\nAlthough the achievements in rice production, education, and industrialization have an undeniable material basis, their common significance is moral and spiritual. They represent, above all, a transformation of the Filipino spirit, from defeatism, sloth, and self-deprecation, to a new level of energy, self-esteem, and the will to achieve our goals.\r\nThis spiritual and intellectual transformation is the New Filipinism.\r\nThe New Filipinism represents the discipline and the ethic of independence. It seeks the substance rather than the shadow of freedom. It develops independence beyond formality to reality.\r\nUnder the influence of this spirit, we have started to reexamine our own narrow outlook on ourselves and the world; we have ceased to think of ourselves as a small and insignificant nation, a nonentity in world affairs; we have started to reexamine the time-honored postulates by which we lived during the past 500 years, and have lifted up our eyes to wider horizons and more ambitious and peremptory goals.\r\nIn the foreseeable future, this new spirit will prompt us to reexamine our own basic institutions and perhaps recast them to make more responsive to the needs of our people. We must not hesitate, from a sense of racial timidity, to change what should be changed. From hereon, we should be guided only by our own sense of what will advance, protect, and fulfill our national interest.\r\nWe must aim at the reality rather than at the formality of democracy. Political and social institutions that merely perpetuate entrenched privileges based on the accident of birth must be remolded or replaced with new ones that promote genuine democracy. I am sure the need for such profound changes may well give the forthcoming Constitutional Convention its greatest challenge.\r\nWe must not be afraid of innovation in our social, economic, political, and cultural life. The New Filipinism is a call for innovation\u2014a revolution directed against the sterile and self-defeating traditions and habits of the race but without bloodshed and without fratricide.\r\nThe New Filipinism is the courage to open up new worlds of opportunity and fulfillment for this and future generations.\r\nThe New Filipinism is, ultimately, a call to greatness. But any form of greatness must begin with an act of will. In the past three years, we\u2014the nation together\u2014performed this act of will and unleashed energies that are now transforming this country.\r\nWe have accordingly set off powerful trends towards national progress that promise to be irreversible, that will be independent of the accidents of leadership and the vicissitudes of parties in the future. It is our conviction that these trends are now so firmly established, future administrations will owe the momentum of their own programs to them, and will be powerless to reverse them.\r\nTransformed by the New Filipinism, the Filipino people will no longer return to the sterility, mediocrity, and timidity of the past. The new spirit of achievement will be indestructible, and will fashion, in time, a great nation of Asia.\r\nI have given expression to some ideas that may be bold and unorthodox. But they are the ideas that will guide us through new and unexplored terrain. They are not mere verbalizations; they were distilled from the fads and realities that impinge on our national life. They constitute, therefore, our strategy for meeting the problems and events of our time.\r\nThere are those among us who will oppose\u2014probably violently\u2014these ideas. Let us hear them out. The democratic dialogue must be preserved. The clash of ideas is the glory and the safeguard of democracy.\r\nMy countrymen: We have reached a turning point in our history. The choice is yours. Shall we venture into this brave new world, bright with possibilities, or retreat to the safety of our familiar but sterile past?\r\nI am for crossing the frontier.\r\nThank you.", "title": "New Filipinism: The Turning Point"},
{"delivered": "1962-01-22 12:38:30+00:00", "author": "Diosdado Macapagal", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 22, 1962]\r\nMr.\u00a0 Vice President,\r\nMr. President,\r\nMr. Speaker,\r\nMonsignor Antiporda,\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the Congress;\r\nI appear before you today, the elected representatives of the sovereign people, not as President of one party but as President of the entire Nation.\r\nAs such, I am charged with the constitutional duty, which I am resolved to carry out, of serving the interests of the members of all groups of our people and doing justice to every man.\r\nIt is in this spirit that I now come before you. For in administering the affairs of this nation, you and I share the common responsibility of providing the leadership, the guidance and the service that a democratic government owes to the people. You and I must provide for their enjoyment of those basic requisites for decent living and of those adequate opportunities for the attainment of material prosperity and spiritual fulfillment. Only thus will they be able to stand in dignity and freedom in the community of nations.\r\nWe assume our joint responsibilities at a time when the Nation is faced with many serious problems. The eyes of the world are focused on us, anxious to see how this new Government will face the difficulties confronting it. Our performance will be judged not only by our own people but also by the other nations of the world, not only by the present but also by posterity.\r\nBecause of the impelling and serious problems facing the country today, I should like to depart from the tradi\u00adtional practice of my illustrious predecessors of delivering an all-embracing State of the Nation message. I shall not burden you now with all the details usually embodied in such a message, especially those related to the customary and routinary activities of the government. While it is recognized that such functions deserve equal and proper attention, I believe it would be more in keeping with the exigencies of the moment to submit, at the proper time and in the hour of need, such special messages to Congress on these matters as may be warranted by circumstances.\r\nIn the interest of priority of purpose, therefore, I beg leave to submit for the consideration of this Congress only the most paramount problems of the Nation which, in my considered opinion, require immediate and preferential attention.\r\nIn my inaugural address, I set forth the goals of our Administration in the coming years, as follows\u2014\r\n1. The solution of the problem of corruption;\r\n2. The attainment of self-sufficiency in the staple food of our people, namely, rice and corn;\r\n3. The creation of conditions that will provide more income to our people\u2014income for those who have none and more income for those whose earnings are inadequate for their elemental needs;\r\n4. The establishment of practices that will strengthen the moral fiber of our nation and reintroduce those values that would invigorate our democracy; and\r\n5. The launching of a bold but well-formulated socio-economic program that shall place the country on the road to prosperity for all our people.\r\nThis five-fold mission may be carried out by resolving two major problems, namely\u2014the need for moral regener\u00adation and the problem of economic growth.\r\nIn the accomplishment of our mission, we have chosen the freedom of democracy as the context for the solution of our problems. Democracy is truly on trial along with us in our social and economic travails.\r\nBy our success or failure in leading the Nation from the abyss of want to the plateau of abundance, not only ourselves but also our way of life will be judged. If we falter, we shall fail democracy as well as our people and thus bolster communism\u2019s boast that it is a superior political system. But if we succeed in laying a dynamic and per\u00admanent base for justice and prosperity in this country, we shall vindicate not only ourselves but democracy itself.\r\nTherefore, I first invite your attention to the decadent state of our public morality. Our efforts to achieve the goal of economic and social fulfillment will be more effective and the results we obtain more permanent only if we can suffuse them with a pervasive moral regeneration.\r\nAt my inauguration, I stated that I would seek to strengthen the nation\u2019s moral fiber through formal modes of reform, enforcement of the laws and the exercise of the tremendous persuasive power of the Presidency in setting the personal example of honesty, uprightness and simple living. The enforcement of the law is solely the responsibility of the Executive Department, but I invite all to join the Executive in wielding the potent power of moral example, and I particularly urge the Congress to assist in conceiving those reforms that will contribute to a moral renaissance of our people.\r\nLet me, however, add that it is wasted effort to steep the young in virtue and morality only to let them realize as they grow up that their elders are neither moral nor virtuous. We -must, therefore, see to it that the prac\u00adtices allowed by law in government and business, in the professions and labor unions, in field and factory\u2014in every area of national endeavor\u2014conform as much as possible with the moral and the ethical. Such practices can be sustained and upheld only if we can at the same time create a strong public opinion that will actively approve them and vigilantly condemn the contrary.\r\nIn our actions, we should not be guided only by what is legal. We must go beyond legality into the demands of morality. Our acts must not only be legal but must be moral as well.\r\nThe second and far-reaching need of the Nation is the solution of the problems pertinent to our economic growth and development. It encompasses all our aspirations to attain self-sufficiency in food and a higher standard of living.\r\nWe must face the problem of economic growth with preferential emphasis. Proper economic development will raise the income of our people and the revenues of the government. It will thus produce the additional funds and facilities necessary for effectively discharging the other functions of government and for meeting the needs of our population. We must ever bear in mind the funda\u00admental fact that it is through the adequate advance of the national economy that a higher standard of living can be attained by our people. We must accelerate the coming of that day when this country shall be not merely the exploited domain of the privileged few but a land where the common man shall stand erect, the equal of his fellow men, able to protect his rights and possessions, and sharing in dignity and freedom in the task of building an ever greater Nation.\r\nBefore assuming the responsibilities of the present, let us first determine the magnitude of our tasks. In this way we may measure the dimensions of the efforts we must exert in order to succeed.\r\nThat magnitude is evident in the rapid growth of our population, and in the corresponding increase in the demand for food, shelter, schools and jobs.\r\nPhilippine population is now growing at the annual rate of 3.2 per cent. This means approximately one million more people every year to feed, to house, to clothe and to employ. What are the implications of this rate of growth?\r\n\u2014By merely main\u00adtaining present consumption levels of essential foods\u2014rice, bread, meat and dairy products\u2014which are below nutri\u00adtional standards, we have to increase rice production by 1.56 million cavans per year, meat by 14 million kilos and milk and dairy products by 11 million pounds.\r\n\u2014Our housing problem defies imagination. In 1960 there were 4,566,000 households in the country, By 1965, based on an estimated 130,000 more households formed each year, the total will increase to some five and one-third million. The rapid concentration of famines in urban centers and the inadequate housing facilities available at the present time emphasize the magnitude of the re\u00adsources required to provide shelter, not to say civilized dwellings, for our people.\r\nExpanding population means that gov\u00adernment services must correspondingly increase. There will be an average of 960 thousand children reaching school age every year. Subtracting the normal loss in graduates and dropouts, the total student population of the country will continue to increase at the rate of no less than 600 thousand each year.\r\nIn 1960 the number of the labor force was 10.2 million. This number will likely increase at the average rate of 360 thousand every year for the next five years. If we are merely to prevent the unemployment rate from increasing, we must create job opportunities for this number of people each year. We must also absorb the backlog of the unemployed and provide fuller employ\u00adment to the underemployed.\r\nThese are only some of the hard facts of our social and economic needs. They are the urgent requirements of our growing population.\r\nDuring the last fifteen years since independence, Philippine economic growth was characterized by many factors and circumstances, namely\u2014\r\n.\u2014The character of the period was manifested in some of the overall statistics of economic growth during this era. Taking the period from 1950 to 1959 as a whole, gross domestic product increased at a compound rate of 6.3 per cent per year while total produc\u00adtion grew at about 3 per cent,\r\nDomestic production was augmented by substantial im\u00adportation. Imports were financed by rising export receipts, by the in-flow of foreign capital largely in the form of re-invested earnings, substantial foreign donations and by a reduction in the country\u2019s international reserves.\r\nThe combination of growing domestic production and substantial imports increased the availability of goods and services in the economy. These were largely absorbed by consumption which increased at the rate of 3.3% per annum per capita. Investments were only increased on a per capita basis at the rate of 1.3% per year. During that period the country was only investing at the rate of P8.62 for every P100.00 worth of gross product available. The rapid growth in domestic production was achieved with relatively small investment of capital. During the decade. it took only P1.36 of investments to get each PI.00 increase in domestic, product\r\nIn the last two years, fairly radical changes in policies have occurred. On April 25, 1960 the cheap dollar policy of the Central Bank came to a close. The policy had under\u00adgone several modifications before that date. But these modifications took somewhat less direct forms. Thus the exchange tax of 17% increased the exchange rate for most important transactions from P2.015 to P2.358. Barter made it possible for exporters of certain grades of commodities to appropriate a portion of the premium on foreign exchange. Finally, the margin fee which replaced the exchange tax effectively raised the exchange rate.\r\nOn December 31, 1955, Executive Order No. 150 in\u00adcreased tariff duties on several commodities and on June 22, 1957, Congress passed the Revised Customs Code of the Philippines which also raised the duties on some lines of imports. These had the effect of raising the cost of imports. But it was not until April 25, 1960 that the Government took official cognizance of the fact that the rate of P2.00 per US $1.00 was unrealistic.\r\nMany firms are now losing gradually the benefits of the tax exemption law. In its stead, the Basic Industries Act provided a more limited tax exemption for the machinery and equipment importation of \u201cbasic industries.\u201d Only import duties, special import taxes and other levies on importation are waived.\r\nWhat does all these mean? Over all, profits on foreign exchange will cease to be a source of inducement for invest\u00adments. To some extent, the Basic Industries Act and the Tariff Code may provide specific inducements to particular types of enterprises. It is safe to anticipate, however, that more than at any time during the last ten years, business enterprises will have to rely for attractiveness of economic efficiency in processing and in distribution.\r\nTwo conclusions follow from the premises:\r\n1. The field for investment during the next ten years will be much narrower at the start because the tests of attractiveness and. feasibility will be more rigorous.\r\n2. The character of the investments will change. More basic developmental effort will be neces\u00adsary.\r\nFurther development of mining, agriculture and forestry will involve more substantial investments in basic facilities\u2014roads, irrigation and water control system, warehouses, heavy equipment for clearing and cultivating, pest control equipment, housing, etc. This is the result of bringing less developed lands under cultivation. The development of forestry will involve exploiting more remote timber lands. The expansion of mineral production will mean more extensive exploitation and development of deposits in more remote places. Further progress in industrializa\u00adtion will mean the establishment of facilities for processing raw materials.\r\nDuring the past ten years, the chief industries which were newly established, being devoted to the later stages of processing, assembly and packaging, had to be located in or around Manila, near the principal markets. In the coming years, the principal industries will likely be located near sources of cheap power or raw materials. Larger investments will be required in the country to set up new communities with all the facilities involved in building water systems, electric power generating and distribution plants, sewerage systems, housing, roads and communications facilities.\r\nFurther growth in the Philippine economy will thus involve larger average investments than in the past. The country will need to rely to a larger extent on external resources from foreign aid, institutional loans, and foreign investment.\r\nTo look at this picture in terms of the statistics of overall economic performance, if from 1950 to 1959 the equivalent of P1.00 of additional output in the economy could be achieved by overall investments in fixed assets and inven\u00adtory of PI.36, in the coming years it will likely take between P2.50 and P3.00 of investment to achieve PI.00 of growth.\r\nThe other side of investment is saving. To try and double the rate of investment will mean that we have to increase the rate of savings in order to continue the growth of per capita product in this country.\r\nThus, today we must begin our labors at a point of economic difficulties. To fully realize the severity of the tasks before us we must recognize that:\r\nFirstly\r\nthe country has fully exhausted the potentialities for growth offered by the complement of policies ruling over the decade of the 1950\u2019s. Over the last three years from 1958 to 1960, the growth rate of real gross national product has declined.\r\nSecondly\r\nit has become obvious that the impetus to investments which exchange controls and various tax incentives provided has worked itself out.\r\nThirdly, the country already enjoys to the fullest extent the export potential feasible under present exchange and trade policies. The weakening of world copra prices has caused the country\u2019s export earnings to level off from the rather steep growth of the last ten years. Even the stability of our earnings from sugar exports is threatened by the current move in the U\u201d. S. Congress to have the United States purchase sugar on the basis of global quota and at \u201cworld free market prices.\u201d\r\nFourthly, this weakening of our export potentials as\u00adsumes most serious proportions in the light of an immediate balance of payments problems. Philippine international reserves have dropped to a precariously low level\u2014unprecedentedly lower than any which has caused great concern in the past.\r\nFinally, we are faced with a serious population problem. Philippine population growth is one of the highest in the world. The country\u2019s requirements for consumer and capital goods must grow with it.\r\nThe urgency of the problems of the present definitely calls for drastic changes in our monetary, fiscal and ex\u00adchange policies. Because of government inaction, specula\u00adtion has become the order of our day. Exporters have been holding back negotiations of export sales. Importers have been fast building up inventories of imported goods in anticipation of higher costs.\r\nUncertainty and instability are visible under the symp\u00adtoms of rising prices, low purchasing power of the currency and increasing unemployment. Fiscal revenues have not increased in proportion to the clamor for more government expenditures. Consequently, the public debt has increased considerably.\r\nBut most important of all, our own investors have for at least the past three years held off making long range plans until the government policies become clearer and more stable. The climate, far from being beneficent to the type of long-term saving and investment which our situation requires, is hostile to long-range planning and encourages short-term speculation.\r\nIn the light of these facts, I must declare that govern\u00adment action is imperative. To this end, we must\u2014\r\na) establish immediately a new, stable base for business valuation and planning to remove the uncertainties that pervade the present economic atmosphere; and\r\nb) set clear directions for overall economic, monetary, fiscal and commercial policies and for government invest\u00adment programs in order to generate a new dynamic for continued economic growth.\r\nIt is essential for the government to formulate and adopt an integrated economic program. Without it, all economic development efforts will be haphazard, sterile, and inef\u00adfectual. There will be uncertainty and the business com\u00admunity will remain in a state of doubt as to what economic policies, decisions, and activities the government will undertake.\r\nThe sluggishness in the pace of economic development in recent years was largely traceable to our failure to officially adopt a concrete economic blueprint that sets down vividly the course which the public authorities are to pursue in the matter of promoting economic growth and which the business community and the people at large may utilize to advantage as a guidepost to their own efforts.\r\nIt is true that there were attempts to formulate an economic planning program for the country, notably by the National Economic Council. The last program for\u00admulated by the Council was for the period 1959-1962-The plan, however, remained good on paper only as it did not receive presidential approval, much less congressional adoption.\r\n.\u2014I am, therefore, submitting to this Congress, as part of this message, an integrated five-year socio-economic development program which we propose to adopt and implement during our tenure and which both the Government and the private sector may use as a guide. This program focuses attention on the most pressing eco\u00adnomic problems of the country and incorporates within its framework our economic philosophy translated into con\u00adcrete, appropriate policy measures and institutional reforms.\r\nAs it shall be tedious to read the whole program on this occasion, I have appended it to this message as Annex A.* For a proper appraisal of this program, I suggest for sup\u00adplemental reference the recent study made by the World Bank on the Philippine national economy, dated January 4, 1962, as well as the last economic development plan made by the National Economic Council, printed copies of which are also appended hereto.\r\nWhile I commend to Congress the full perusal of this socio-economic program, I should like to underscore some of its more significant highlights.\r\nThe great goals we seek and the critical condition of the economy today make it essential for the Government to accomplish the three-fold objective of: 1) immediately restoring economic stability; 2) alleviating the plight of the common man; and 3) establishing a dynamic basis for future growth.\r\nThe present speculative atmosphere in Philippine busi\u00adness springs from uncertainty with respect to government policies. With the objective of immediately stabilizing the economy, and apropos of the five principal sources of instability I have earlier indicated, we propose to imple\u00adment\u2014\r\nFirst, a program of exchange rate adjustment and unifi\u00adcation and a procedure for orderly decontrol to transfer the allocation of foreign exchange to a genuinely free market;\r\nSecond, a set of complementary measures to protect Philippine and Filipino industry and agriculture from undue foreign competition at their \u201cinfant stages\u201d; and\r\nThird, a set of policies and measures to provide guar\u00adantees to foreign investors in particular lines of investments, principally mineral exploration and heavy industries such as iron and steel and basic chemicals, together with an official declaration of preference for joint international business ventures with substantial Filipino capital and management participation.\r\nIt is my privilege to inform Congress that yesterday, January 21, 1962 I approved a unanimous decision by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, embodied in its Cir\u00adcular No. 133, to institute the first large measure of genuine decontrol in our foreign exchange transactions since the establishment of exchange controls over a dozen years ago. This is both in fulfillment of our electoral pledge to the Filipino people and in compliance with the provision of the law requiring decontrol by 1963. In an atmosphere of freedom, our entrepreneurs and citizens may now achieve prosperity for themselves and the country not through arti\u00adficial advantage but through their talent, integrity and in\u00addustry.\r\nExchange control had become a cesspool of corruption that brought disgrace to the Nation. With genuine de\u00adcontrol now in effect, we have removed a vital source of graft and, I trust, we have thus shown that we are ready to give up a part of the economic and political powers of the Presidency to eradicate corruption and promote the national wellbeing.\r\nThis action had become imperative and desirable for several reasons. The imbalances of the past must be righted. The administration of controls had become so complicated and cumbersome that only a sweeping change could remedy the situation. There was such a shocking maladministration of economic policy, particularly as regards fiscal and foreign exchange policies, that inflationary forces had been reactivated and our dollar reserve had been vir\u00adtually wiped out. At the same time, a new climate was desirable in which our economy could move forward with confidence and optimism despite transitional difficulties.\r\nIt may now be expected that with genuine decontrol instituted in our foreign exchange transactions, a completely new atmosphere will prevail in our economy. The alloca\u00adtion of foreign exchange and the determination of the ex\u00adchange rate will be left to market forces rather than to the arbitrary decisions of administrators. We should clear the obstacles which have grown up in the past during the re\u00adgime of controls, and liberate the energies and imagination of our people and our entrepreneurs for economic projects of lasting value to the country. For the first time, the people will have it in their hands to determine the true external value of the peso by their freedom in buying and selling, without the necessity of licensing. With the uncer\u00adtainties of an arbitrary control mechanism removed, I expect renewed investments to take place. Furthermore, with barriers to free movement removed, I expect foreign invest\u00adments to come in an ever greater flow to supplement our savings and augment our investments.\r\nAs is the case with any necessary moves of a sweeping nature, there will be difficulties at the outset, but these will be transitional and should lay the base for real economic stability with a more rational economic system in the future. Some of these difficulties are the necessary outcome of the previous practice of disguising overall arbitrary and in\u00adflationary policies by favoring a few commodities with spe\u00adcial treatment. In so doing, they only postponed the real solution to our problems by diverting our productive re\u00adsources away from the production of substitutes for these commodities.\r\nIn order to prevent runaway inflationary movements, the Monetary Board has taken complementary measures to restrain the unwarranted creation of credit, especially for speculative purposes. As a further protection to con\u00adsumers, I have directed the Secretary of Justice to study and alert the applicability of Article 186 of the Revised Penal Code aimed at conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade or collusions in fixing prices.\r\nAll these moves have been taken after consultation with and approval by the International Monetary Fund. In ad\u00addition, we have secured commitments from the United States Government and from private banking institutions to support our decontrol program. I am glad to announce that the Special Presidential Mission to the United States headed by Acting Secretary of Finance Fernando E. V. Sison has secured financial support for these moves in the amount of $300 million, This does not include the amount of $55 million still available from the International Mone\u00adtary Fund, $93.7 million worth of commodity accommoda\u00adtions from U.S. Law 480 and $73 million from additional war damage payments. We can count on further support from both international and United States entities including the U. S. Treasury once our decontrol program is underway, as well as financial support that may be negotiated with other countries.\r\nIn substantiation of this statement, I quote hereunder a dispatch datelined Washington, relayed by UPI and pub\u00adlished in this afternoon\u2019s papers, as follows:\r\n\u201cWashington, Jan 21 (UPI)\u2014The United States demonstrated its support of the new Philippine program by announcing it will provide the Philippines with loans from the Agency for International Development and the Export-Import Bank.\r\n\u201cThe U.S. Treasury will also assist President Diosdado Macapagal\u2019s new foreign exchange program with its stabilization fund.\u201d\r\nOur decontrol program, therefore, is fully backed up by massive and more than adequate financial support that we have merited from external sources. With the coopera\u00adtion of all concerned, I am confident that the decontrol program will succeed to pave the way for a stronger economy and prosperity in freedom for our people.\r\nI must emphasize that the launching of genuine decontrol is only the short-term commencement of our long-term economic program. We are laying the basis for stable and orderly growth with a stable and orderly currency. I am arranging for large long-run production and development credits to bolster our investment effort, as distinguished from short-term commercial credits which have been used at times for speculative purposes. I am also going ahead with plans to set up a private industrial development bank, towards whose subscription we expect to secure external financing both from international agencies and from funds generated under U.S. Public Law 480.\r\nI feel confident of the success of the decontrol program, both because of the complementary measures that go with it and the massive financial support which we have merited from external sources. I call on our people to face the new situation without apprehen\u00adsion and excitement and to set their sights on the prospects of a bright future rather than on the temporary difficulties of the present. I assure our people that I have taken this step in fulfillment of my sworn duty to serve only their welfare. Some transitional difficulties are perhaps inevit\u00adable but in due time, the situation will open the enjoyment of a better life for our people. The best norm of conduct for all is to behave with restraint and patriotism so as not to place undue strain on our currency. I feel confi\u00addent that the people will comport themselves in their own best interests.\r\nAs we have taken the measure of genuine decontrol for the wellbeing of our people, we will not brook any conspi\u00adracies against them by attempts to foil up the program. Should any speculative movements arise, I declare that the ample financial resources which we have secured will be deployed against movements unwarranted by normal market forces and that the full force of the law will be brought to bear against speculators and conspirators.\r\nIn any event, such speculative movements cannot be of long duration, as our economic development program goes into gear and the country\u2019s production begins to fill the pipelines of commerce and to elevate the living standards of our people.\r\nTo cope with the long-run foreign exchange problems of the country, the integrated economic program sets as one of its major objectives the promotion of our export trade in order to raise adequate foreign exchange resources a) to meet the import requirements of the nation for the next five years; b) to honor all the foreign exchange liabilities of the country including investment remittances, interest and amor\u00adtization on foreign loans and repatriation of capital; and c) to generate an increase in the international reserves which will provide the fund adequate to stabilize the international value of the peso.\r\nOne of the principal fears of business in the decontrol of foreign exchange is the loss of the protection which exchange controls provided to domestic industry against un\u00addue external domination. There is no valid ground for this fear. As the exchange control machinery is dismantled, the alternative means of achieving the legitimate ends of controls shall be instituted. To this end, I have availed of the power granted us by law to increase the rates of import duty on nearly 700 articles already being produced by domestic industries in order to provide them a means to meet the loss of the protection they have enjoyed under exchange control. Besides this measure, we propose\u2014\r\n1) To make such further increases in the tariff as may be found necessary to provide a reasonable margin of preference which will render domestic producers more competitive;\r\n2) Wherever necessary, the Tariff Commission shall recommend the imposition of countervailing duties under Section 302 of the Tariff Code to offset benefits that may be derived by imports from foreign subsidies. To the same end, the Secretary of Finance has been instructed to immediately cause to be undertaken a study of articles of imports that are being \u201cdumped\u201d into the Philippine market from abroad within the context of Section 301 of Republic Act 1937;\r\n3) The Tariff Commission has been directed to imme\u00addiately investigate, in accordance with Paragraph G of Section 402 of the Tariff Code, whether and to what extent commodities imported by the Philippines from countries with which a trade agreement has been entered are being im\u00adported in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products in order to recommend the establishment of import quotas for the protection of the domestic industries affected.\r\nIt will be noted that the program raises the necessity of earnestly attracting foreign capital to assist in the financing of the program. For this reason, a healthy climate for foreign investments must resolutely be created. This task is related to nationalism, with respect to which it is desirable to set forth concretely and clearly the position of the Administration.\r\nThe Administration upholds nationalism. Properly chan\u00adneled, nationalism is a constructive and powerful force in the growth of a nation. Its assertion considers relevant factors such as choice of field and timing. It has been asserted wisely in the nationalization of the retail trade, which is the channel of distribution of the elemental re\u00adquirements of our masses in their day-to-day living. It has been asserted even more wisely in the nationalization of the rice and corn industries, which provide the staple food of our people.\r\nWhile we uphold that the principal responsibility for development should belong to Filipino citizens, who must be the principal determinants as well as chief beneficiaries of Philippine economic progress, we at the same time caution against the type of radical nationalism and nationalization measures that deter the coming of foreign assistance in our economic development. We must be sincere in at\u00adtracting foreign capital to invest in productive enterprises in our country in joint ventures with Filipino businessmen and must show this sincerity not in words but in deeds.\r\nThe second goal of our integrated economic program is the immediate alleviation of the plight of the common man. In comparison with the living standards of the relatively wealthier countries, ours in the Philippines is far from adequate. The per capita consumption of superior foods like meat, eggs and milk, beans and vegetables is far below healthy nutritional standards and much lower than what obtains in wealthier countries.\r\nMoreover, within the Nation itself, the distribution of welfare is far from satisfactory. This is indeed a nation of contrasts where very few regions and communities enjoy affluence in contrast to widespread poverty in others.\r\nIt is our avowed task in the program to translate objec\u00adtives into specific improvements in the overall level of eco\u00adnomic welfare and its distribution. Improvement in this sense means that our production capacity must grow more rapidly than the growth of our population. It also means that those regions that have lagged behind in progress must be given special assistance to enable them to participate more fully in over-all national progress.\r\nIn accordance with my pledge, I have incorporated, as a major feature of our five-year socio-economic plan, a rice and corn program to bring about, at the earliest possible time, sufficiency in those cereals at prices within the reach of our masses. It is paradoxical that in a land with resources ideally suited to the production of rice, the country is unable to produce enough of this product which is the staple food of our people. We must liquidate this problem with resolve and success as a first priority. It is ironical to talk of magnificent plans for progress and prosperity if we cannot even provide the rice and corn that our common people cannot go without in their daily lives. Before attempting anything else, let us work together to insure that our people have and be able to afford the rice and corn that they need in their daily living.\r\nWe shall also concentrate our efforts to raise agricultural productivity throughout all the regions in the country in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. It is incumbent upon government to provide improved irrigation and water control facilities, the continuation of subsidies for fertilizers and seeds, expansion of research programs for developing high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of agricultural crops, the establishment of liberal credit facili\u00adties, and the improvement of marketing and transportation networks.\r\n\u2014-Our greatest task in improv\u00ading the welfare of the masses is to ensure that opportunities for employment are generated. Our program envisions that the attainment of the target increase in overall domestic production of about 6 per cent per annum over the period FY 1963 to 1967 will ensure that some 330,000 to 360,000 jobs will be provided annually to absorb a large portion of the yearly increase in the labor force. It is also a part of our program that the greater portion of the annual increase in employment is to be absorbed in industrial production. This will increase the average wage earnings of the mass of our workers.\r\nI also propose greater outlays by the Government for public services designed to improve the general living standards of the people, particularly in the less developed areas of this country. It is my belief that the Government can provide a total outlay of P656.6 mil\u00adlion for public education, about P15 million for low cost housing projects and P470 million for public health over the next five years. The public health program shall include expansion of health services in rural areas, water supply, reduction of infant mortality, tuberculosis and malaria con\u00adtrol, establishment of medical research centers, and nutri\u00adtion research.\r\nOur final goal is to establish a framework of policies that will give a stable basis and a more realistic and sober impetus to a new growth trend which will extend much farther into the future. The new dynamic for economic progress that we seek and should attain must be of a more genuine quality and must provide a richer and longer lasting energy for national progress.\r\nIn assuming our proper responsibilities, we shall be guided by the economic philosophy of Faith in the Filipino. We believe that economic development is principally a task of private enterprise and not of government. The government\u2019s role is to create a favorable environment that will provide the inducements necessary, in terms of suitable policies and measures needed, to foster economic growth and stability. It must be in a position to devise new and effective methods, democratic in character and spirit, to induce the private sector\u2014properly called the dynamic sector\u2014to risk idle capital for development purposes.\r\nThe exchange rate adjustment and the stabilization pro\u00adgram are expected of themselves to create a fundamental climate favorable to investments in the required lines of activity. The specific role of government will be to provide direct assistance where needed, to establish required social overhead facilities, and to ensure that bottle-necks to pro\u00adduction are neither created nor allowed to persist.\r\nI must point out, however, that the restoration to a large degree of the freedom of enterprise does not remove from government the obligation to exercise economic leadership. On the contrary, government leadership not only becomes all the more important, but its exercise must be all the more firm as it is all the more just, imaginative and skillful.\r\nThe first requirement for government is to ensure the judicious application of public investment programs to the establish\u00adment of basic facilities such as roads and irrigation systems, transportation and communications networks, hydroelectric power, harbor facilities, and the development of land, forest and mineral resources. The program envisions that it is feasible for the Government to put up directly P2,809 mil\u00adlion over the five-year period 1963 to 1967 for these purposes. These investments will amount to an annual average of P562 million to be financed from current government sav\u00adings, reparations, foreign loans, and domestic bond issues.\r\nThe second requirement for government is the establish\u00adment of a complement of policies designed to induce and mobilize the maximum of internal domestic savings and the maximum external financing in order to sustain the overall investment requirements of the economic development program.\r\nOver the five years from FY 1963 to 1967, we anticipate that a total of P11,500 million must be mobilized in the form of domestic savings out of a total gross national income of P78,200 million expected over the same period.\r\nAll the powers at present available to induce savings out of current incomes must be put to effective use. The Central Bank of the Philippines shall be urged to push with greater vigor the establishment of local community cooperative banks and savings and loan associations and to encourage these institutions to offer more attractive in\u00adducements for systematic savings plans.\r\nIt is necessary to undertake a careful re-examination of the tax structure so as to ascertain the impact of the present tax rates on investment activity and living costs; to adjust the rates or eliminate those taxes that are either unduly inequitable or are hampering the growth of invest\u00adments and output and to recommend new tax measures to support the government\u2019s socio-economic program. The Executive-Legislative Tax Commission should immediately apply itself to this problem and make appropriate recom\u00admendations as early as possible for desirable changes in the tax structure consistent with the basic objectives of economic policy.\r\nIt is likewise the objective to promote the expansion of the facilities and resources of existing financial interme\u00addiaries, and the establishment of new ones designed to induce habits of thrift in, and mobilize the savings of the rural communities.\r\nIn anticipation of foreign investments and loans from abroad, our program proposes to provide facilities for private business that will enable them to meet the requirements of foreign investors and creditors in a manner that will redound to the greatest advantage of the country.\r\nWe likewise foresee that the establishment of a new complement of policies necessitates adjustment\u2014the bene\u00adficiaries of older policies are likely to suffer the burden of losing benefits. It is incumbent on government to antici\u00adpate and measure the costs of adjustment, and to distribute its burden in an equitable manner.\r\nThe goal of the program is essentially to ensure that domestic production, augmented by imports, shall be ade\u00adquate to supply the needs of our people.\r\nIn order to meet the requirements and to improve over\u00adall levels of living, gross domestic product needs to grow over the five-year period at a compound rate of 6 per cent. The annual growth rate must rise from 5.5 per cent between 1962 and 1963 up to 7.0 per cent from 1966 to 1967.\r\nThe targets are feasible provided\u2014\r\n1. An average of 16.1 per cent of gross domestic product is channeled into gross domestic investments during the five fiscal years;\r\n2. Gross domestic savings including reinvestments of foreign earnings in the Philippines reach 13 per cent of gross domestic product in FY 1963, 13.8 per cent in 1964, 14.6 per cent in 1965, 15.4 per cent in 1966, and 16.0 per cent in 1967;\r\n3. There is a total net inflow of new foreign capital into the country of roughly U. S. $860 million during the five-year period; and\r\n4. The export earnings of the country total U. S. $3.7 billion during the period or an average of $740 million annually.\r\nThe rate of gross domestic investments is intended to mobilize new capital formation of P12.7 billion over the five fiscal years. This amount has been allocated on the basis of a first approximation of sectoral and regional priori\u00adties that give emphasis on the production of import substi\u00adtutes such as integrated iron and steel, basic chemicals, pulping plants, expansion of agricultural food production and processing, and the development of the cattle and dairy industries.\r\nThe Government\u2019s share in the total investment target is placed at P2.8 billion or 22 per cent of the total target of P12.7 billion. The public investment program includes principally P1.3 billion for water supply, roads, highways and irrigation, and Pl.l billion for power development, and expansion of railroad lines and of telecommunications.\r\nIn these magnitudes, the total program can be financed entirely from non-inflationary sources: from domestic savings as well as foreign loans and investments. In ad\u00addition to the normal growth of domestic savings flowing through such financial intermediaries as the commercial banks, the Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security System, the Postal Savings Bank and the private insurance companies, the program contemplates the estab\u00adlishment of rural savings institutions and cooperative banks to encourage systematic savings out of current income in the farm areas.\r\nThe anticipated government revenues during the program period are expected to cover current expenditures and a little savings to finance a portion of the public investment program. The balance will be financed out of bond issue sold at competitive money rates directly to insurance com\u00adpanies, pension funds, private banks, and other private investors.\r\nAn outstanding feature of the program is the contem\u00adplated reorganization of public administration to improve the machinery for the formulation and implementation of consistent economic plans and fiscal and monetary policies, to achieve maximum coordination among the various de\u00adpartments of the Executive Branch of Government in the pursuit of economic objectives, and to attain more rigorous control over government budgetary and developmental ex\u00adpenditures.\r\nI shall take the initiative of immediately implementing those remedial measures that need no legislation, and such part of the program will be the responsibility of the Execu\u00adtive.\r\nBut many of the specific measures that must be estab\u00adlished require legislative action. They shall be measures of far-reaching implications.\r\nI, therefore, recommend for your consideration the enactment of legislation which would establish, promote, and sustain the following specific measures:\r\n1. The establishment and financing of a Moral Commis\u00adsion composed of outstanding and upright leaders in government, religion, education and the professions. This Com\u00admission shall study and recommend ways and means by which all elements and institutions of the country may be mobilized towards the goal of national moral regeneration.\r\n2. The adoption of a comprehensive program on rice and corn which shall achieve self-sufficiency in these cereals at prices within the reach of the masses; and the establish\u00adment and financing of a Rice and Corn Administration to implement the program. This entity shall absorb the functions of the NARIC and shall coordinate various pro\u00adgrams concerning the production, processing, and marketing of rice.\r\n3. The enactment of legislation to assist private enter\u00adprise in the creation of job opportunities. Specific measures will be submitted to Congress to support employment proj\u00adects that not only will create jobs but will also simulta\u00adneously increase production and productivity.\r\n4. The appropriation of funds for the construction of apartment houses for displaced squatters and persons per\u00adtaining to the lowest-income groups who shall pay nominal rentals for occupancy thereof.\r\n5. Greater outlays by the government for the improve\u00adment and expansion of essential public services designed to raise the general living standards of the people, especially in economically-depressed regions of the country. These public services include education, more low-cost housing, and public health.\r\n6. Further revision of tariff rates as Congress may deem necessary with the following objective:\r\na. To use tariffs as instruments of economic development by protecting our domestic industries until such reasonable time when these industries can be exposed to world competition.\r\nb. To discourage conspicuous consumption by imposing prohibitive tariffs on luxuries.\r\n7. The passage of a foreign investments law, with the following objectives;\r\na. To clearly delineate the fields of economic activities open to foreign capital, thereby protecting the preferential rights of Filipinos in certain economic fields.\r\nb. To attract new foreign investments to flow into the country.\r\nc. To define unequivocably the treatment of foreign capital, particularly concerning repatriation of capital and remittances of profits.\r\n8. The enactment of an appropriate law imposing a selective export tax on certain protected exports, and on raw materials that can be processed locally, with the following objectives:\r\na. To prevent inflationary pressures arising from decontrol and generated by generated by windfall incomes of recipients of foreign exchanges.\r\nb. To expand government sources of investible funds for overhead projects essential to economic growth, by obtaining such funds from a sector which has ample resources.\r\n9. The repeal of the margin levy on foreign exchange, to give relief to the consumers who will ultimately bear the burden of adjustments in the exchange rates arising from the decontrol program.\r\n10. The repeal of the barter law.\r\n11. To re-examine and revise the tax structure so as to ascertain the impact of the present tax rates on investment activity and living costs; to adjust the rates or eliminate those that are inequitable and to enact new tax laws to support the government\u2019s industrialization program. Spe\u00adcific tax bills shall be presented to Congress in due course during the regular session.\r\n12. To amend the charters of the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Government Service Insurance System and the Social Security System in order to funnel the funds of the last two entities to the Development Bank of the Philippines for lending purposes, with the view to expanding the authority of the latter to grant long-term industrial and investment loans for productive enterprises.\r\n13. The creation of an Anti-Smuggling Office to era\u00addicate smuggling activities that seriously deprive the Na\u00adtional Treasury of due customs and internal revenue receipts,\r\n14. The adoption of the five-year integrated socio-economic development program embodied in this message, in order that this program may become not only the program of the Administration but also of the entire Government. Thereby, the program shall serve as the nation\u2019s guidepost for economic progress and shall be effectively implemented through the joint efforts of the people and the Government.\r\nAllow me to impress upon you and upon all citizens of the Republic that the task of achieving a modicum of economic development, especially in a developing country like ours, requires serious and concerted effort on the part of both the Government and the people.\r\nAttainment of the desired goals will depend mainly upon public support and a sympathetic understanding of our objectives.\r\nThe Government takes the initiative and provides the inducements necessary in terms of suitable policies and measures needed to foster economic growth and stability.\r\nThe people, on the other hand, must realize that eco\u00adnomic development involves, particularly during transi\u00adtory stages, sacrifices of magnitude and the subordination of personal ambition and interest to the general welfare.\r\nI say then with candor and emphasis that our people must be ready to undergo sacrifices. The prospects of better times are not likely to be realized without the imposition of self-discipline and the assumption of certain social responsibilities. Progress and prosperity will come. It will come, if all the people rally to maintain economic freedom and security and a higher standard of living for themselves. Single-handedly we cannot realize these ob\u00adjectives. Together, we shall.\r\nThe responsibilities of the Executive and Legislative branches of the Government are just as demanding. All the agencies of the Executive, including financial institutions and corporations, will be mobilized towards a coor\u00addinated implementation of the program. We shall take particular pains to see that there is a minimum of conflict between our announced goals, our economic philosophy, and the day-to-day operations of all those government agencies with which the private sector is continuously in contact.\r\nBut the Executive alone cannot meet the prodigious tasks that are required to supply the needs and demands of our people. The Legislative branch has a share in this responsibility. I seek your full cooperation. I will submit additional legislative proposals to this body which are necessitated by an integrated analysis of our economic situation, our problems and our requirements that consti\u00adtute the basis of our program. From time to time, as the situation requires, I shall come to consult you on pressing matters requiring legislative action.\r\nNo one is more aware than I of the coordinate impor\u00adtance of the Executive and Legislative departments of our Government. I am aware of their basic independence of each other.\r\nI am also aware of the need for cooperation between them if the business of government is not to suffer, and if the welfare of the people is to be safeguarded. I there\u00adfore appeal to each member of the Fifth Congress to set aside partisanship and contribute his experience and wis\u00addom to the common task entrusted to us by our people. We face a challenge to our free political system, to our dedication as public servants and to our patriotism as Filipinos.\r\nWe have been elected under different parties but we have been elected by the same people. As the people did not mind our political parties in placing in our hands their welfare and future, so are we called upon not to mind our parties in serving their well-being. Adhering firmly to this attitude, with minds anxious over our people\u2019s difficulties and hearts full of sympathy for their just long\u00adings for a better life, I have faith that Almighty God will show us the way that we can take together towards the fulfillment of our Nation\u2019s dream for a life of dignity, prosperity and freedom.", "title": "Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Program for the Philippines"},
{"delivered": "1959-01-26 11:57:38+00:00", "author": "Carlos P. Garcia", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 26, 1959]\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress:\r\nI address you today to sound a call for vital and bold decisions on the future of our national economy.\r\nThe eyes of our people are on us in this hall and their ears are cupped toward this lectern on which I stand, in anxious anticipation of what the national leadership, which you and I share by their will under the Constitution, will say and do in the way of meeting and overcoming the obstacles and difficulties of a trying situation and keeping the nation on an even keel.\r\nI say, first of all, that I have full faith in the Filipino people\u2019s capacity to emerge with flying colors out of any and all crises. We went through the hell of it under a ruthless military occupation government for four years and survived with a more sturdy and rugged national spirit. Once again with the determination of a united people deriving inspiration from our heroic past and our dream of a glorious tomorrow and with divine guidance and help we shall emerge triumphant out of the present predicament. But we must keep our equanimity. I am confident we shall be equal to the task. There is absolutely no cause for despair. At any rate, whatever problems may beset us\u2014whether the national economy or any other\u2014the can be solved only with calmness even as we have to deliberate, determines, and decisive in action. We cannot afford to indulge in defeatism or in negative or divisive thinking.\r\nI shall be forthright. The need for fiscal and economic stabilization is urgent and must be met by the Government with the full support of all elements comprising the nation. On the part of the Government, the executive and legislative branches are especially called upon to formulate wisely and, more than that, to implement determinedly, once and for all, the most effective courses of action. On the part of the people, the most productive efforts, thrift, and consistently sustained willingness to contribute to the common weal must become a reality.\r\nAs head of the Executive Department, I hereby pledge that all its efforts shall be directed at conducting government affairs on the basis of strict economy, of worth public endeavors, and of sagacious utilization of the people\u2019s assets and contributions to undertakings that will pay back dividends to them in terms of service and steady progress.\r\n.\u2014Indeed, we have progressed. The difficulties with which we are confronted today are a paradox. They arose precisely because of the strides we have made in industry, agriculture, and other phases of the economy speeded up during the past five years.\r\nSubstantial progress has been made in production. For the first time since the war, we have such a bumper rice crop this year. The production of corn and other agricultural products has shown much significant gains that warrant the claim that we have attained self-sufficiency in food. Unquestionably, industrial output has been on the rise.\r\n.\u2014In my report on the state of the nation a year ago, I pointed out that the threat of Communism as well as the natural desire of our people to improve their lot prompted the administration of my late predecessor to accelerate economic development, to the extent of taking a calculated risk inherent in the liberal use of national credit. Faced with limited savings characteristic of an undeveloped economy, the nation had to resort to credit creation. This was in order to cover the inevitable gap between the growth of needed investments and voluntary savings to finance the public works and power projects necessary in launching the momentum of development. The alternative would have been not to undertake development projects at all. This, in turn, would have consigned our economy to stagnation, our people to poverty, and the nation to frustration.\r\nThe government granted tax exemptions, priority dollar allocations for raw materials, easy credit for essential industries, and protection through controls. Stimulated by these development policies, a stepped-up rate of investment both in the public and the private sectors yielded significant gains.\r\n.\u2014However, and this is the crux of the matter, at the rate at which these investments in public and private sectors have been undertaken and because of the way they have been financed, which is by expanding credit, it is inevitable that the pressures of inflation have become more pronounced.\r\nIn 1958, this was aggravated by the economic recession among our principal trading partners\u2014a factor beyond our control.\r\nThe immediate problem today is how to check the inflationary forces that are exerting a heavy pressure on our international reserves. At the same time, we should maintain the momentum of development at an appropriate rate so that the gains we have already achieved will not be dissipated. Thus, the country will forge ahead towards its goal of development. We cannot afford to stop. We must not stop.\r\n.\u2014In the midst of the vicissitudes around us, I propose that we carry on with our economic development program within the scope of real resources available to us. We cannot freeze the economic development program although we have to decelerate to some extent our national budget financed by higher levels of tax revenues so that effective demand may be reduced, and our international reserve replenished while our industrial and agricultural production continues a healthy pace. To these we must add the need for establishing new or widening external markets.\r\n.\u2014Nor must we lose sight of social objectives which can be achieved only through economic development, if our people are to have the more, materially as well as spiritually, satisfying life they hope for and expect. We cannot abandon the masses to perennial poverty. We cannot even allow the present unemployment situation and the high cost of living to remain static much longer. We must act to check their rise.\r\nWe must bring economic stability to the common man and his family as well as to the nation at large. We must pursue a course which will bring about a good balance between agricultural and industrial developments. We must reduce our deficit financing for economic development. We must exert fresh efforts to increase revenues from new and revised taxes to be returned, as I have said, to our people in the form of public services and wider opportunities for expansion and employment.\r\nNotwithstanding the grave difficulties encountered last year, this nation has continued to progress in general. Since 1954, the national economy has grown tremendously in volume of physical production. The national income has increased by about six per cent a year during the past five years.\r\n.\u2014An overall increase of seven per cent in the volume of food crop production over that of the previous year was achieved through an intensive food production campaign. Technical and export crops, except sugar, also increased during the year.\r\nThe livestock population also made significant gains during the same year, increasing by eight per cent over that of the preceding year.\r\n.\u2014Mineral production, one of the primary sources of export earnings, has gone up by more than 50 per cent since 1954 though it has not yet recovered its pre-war level. Gold production showed a substantial rise of six per cent in 1958 over that of 1957. This was the outcome of concessions to the industry in the form of liberal allocations of foreign exchange for equipment and of the grant to owners of blocked funds of the privilege to purchase gold for resale to the Central Bank for foreign exchange. Production of base metals, such as chromite, iron, and quicksilver, declined in 1958 with the slackening of world demand and prices.\r\n.\u2014Since 1954 when we launched our development program, manufacturing activity has recorded a spectacular 52 per cent advance. The establishment of 134 new tax-exempt industrial concerns in 1958 continued the trend of previous years. These industries are largely in food and consumer goods manufacture, textiles, plastics, fabrication of containers, chemicals and fertilizers, pulp and paper.\r\n.\u2014In its efforts to intensify agricultural production, with particular emphasis on achieving self-sufficiency in food, the Government continued to make heavy investments in social overhead projects.\r\nThe main and feeder road networks have been improved and expanded.\r\nThe Manila Railroad Company has completed the second year of full dieselization of locomotives resulting in substantial reduction in fuel and lubricant consumption.\r\nThe Central Luzon electrification project is underway and the construction of the biggest hydro-electric plant in the Philippines in Binga, with an estimated rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, is expected to be completed next year.\r\nOperations of the Philippine Air Lines continue to play a vital role in the economic life of the Philippines. Domestic operations for Philippine cities and towns were improved by expanding existing landing fields to accommodate heavier traffic. Plans are completed for our return to foreign or international service. The international tourist trade can be further expanded.\r\n.\u2014The increasing activity of commerce and industry is reflected in the growth of banking facilities throughout the country. There are 131 commercial and savings banks and branches today. Total resources of our banking system have correspondingly expanded. Whereas there were no rural banks in 1949, there are now 120 of them distributed throughout the rural areas. Likewise, 500 cooperative marketing associations now provide small farmers with credit, storage, and marketing services.\r\n.\u2014Our foreign trade has intensified, with exports and imports showing an upward surge compared with 1953 levels. Our exports aggregated P801 million in 1954; they totaled P897 million in 1958, chalking up a notable increase of P96 million in four years. Imports which amounted to P957 million in 1954, increased to P1.1 billion in 1958.\r\nWhile importation of foodstuff added a burden on our international reserve, the pattern of imports has been significantly revised. More than 80 per cent of imports last year were capital goods and raw materials. Only the balance of 20 per cent went to consumer goods. The increase in export production and the modified import pattern reflected an overall economic gain for the country in foreign trade.\r\nAs we can see, our foreign exchange earnings have not kept pace with the rising internal demand for imports. The gap had to be financed from our international reserve so that our development program would not be paralyzed at its crucial first stages. Because of leakages, estimated at about $80 million, through barter, no-dollar importations and illegal export and import practices, the contribution to our free international reserve from export earning in 1958 was far from satisfactory. Furthermore, what was available from foreign loans in the second half of 1958 did not contribute to meeting fully our actual development requirements for foreign exchange. Mainly as a result of the austerity measures in handling resources, we were able to reduce our unfavorable overall balance of payments (deficit) from $124 million in 1957 to $17 million in 1958. At the rate we are going, we hope to wipe out this remaining negligible deficit in our foreign trade during the next fiscal year and start chalking up favorable balance of payments thereafter. But the decline in our international reserve persisted as result of efforts to provide our expanding industries with their increasing raw material requirements and to stabilize domestic prices of prime commodities.\r\n.\u2014Domestic trade made progress during the year under review. The implementation of the Retail Trade Nationalization Act and the Retailers\u2019 Fund Law gave encouragement and support to many of our native retail stores.\r\nThe Government price stabilization agencies assisted Filipino retailers in improving their merchandizing activities and in increasing their participation in distribution, in order to stabilize the prices of commodities in short supply.\r\nLast year, I stressed to you, Gentlemen of the Congress, the need for raising additional sources of revenues amounting to P158.7 million to finance our expanded fiscal operations required by our growing population and committed policies of development. Unfortunately, none of the various revenue measures was finally approved except the Tax Census Bill. On the other hand, supplementary appropriation/bills were approved by Congress which increased the expenditure proposals in our budget, thus widening the disparity between revenues and expenditures. In an effort to adhere as closely as possible to the principle of a balanced budget and to minimize the need for deficit financing with its adverse inflationary repercussions on the national economy, the Administration had to go on rigid austerity. It scaled down expenditures at the beginning of the fiscal year by P259.4 million. Towards the end of calendar year 1958, our fiscal situation was confronted by indications that revenues would be less than expected owing to the drop in customs collections. Once again, the Executive Branch was constrained to apply further stringent retrenchments in government expenditures. Of the total recommended cuts by the Fiscal Committee of the Cabinet amounting to P74 million, I could only approve P18.6 million because I did not believe in cuts that would sacrifice essential services, especially those in the Department of Education.\r\nAusterity had to go deep into our capital investment for development. The originally envisaged amount of P375 million with general revenue funds, special funds, and bond issues as components was scaled down to P275 million. Of this amount, P175 million was to come from bond issued, but even this ceiling was brought down to P110 million, the irreducible minimum needed to prosecute to termination those projects already started by private contractors with orders already placed abroad. Besides, most of these projects were essential to those already in operation. I present these unprecedented retrenchments in the total amount of P278 million as an answer to those who say that the Administration has reneged from its policy of austerity.\r\nTogether with the retrenchments in government expenditures, efforts were intensified to tap new sources of savings to finance our country\u2019s development. This was to avoid usual credit creation which brings about inflation and the risk of a substantial drain on the international reserve.\r\nAs pointed out in my budget message last year, we must recognize that the present revenue sources are no longer adequate to finance the requirements of an accelerated development program. During the fiscal year 1958 only eight per cent of the national income was diverted to the public sector in the form of taxes. It is obvious that we can raise this percentage by reducing consumption taxes and by increasing direct taxes on income and wealth thereby making an equitable distribution of tax burden on the basis of capacity to pay.\r\n.\u2014The national concern over unemployment found cause for optimism in the 1958 Labor-Management Congress during which labor and management together formulated plans designed to reduce the areas of unemployment. I will endorse several of these proposals to this Congress for consideration.\r\n.\u2014Since the Social Security Act was implemented in 1957, 1,400,000 employers and employees throughout the Philippines have been covered against the hazards of death, disability, and sickness as well as of old age. Direct social security benefits are now extended to them. The System has also generated P28 million in public and private investments for the economic development of the country within a little more than a year.\r\nHowever, our agricultural laborers who constitute the balance of 65 per cent of our workers are not yet enjoying the protective coverage of social security. This matter claims immediate attention of Congress.\r\nThe Government Service Insurance System continues to provide security benefits for workers in the public service. It has granted benefits in the form of pensions, disability and death payments, and financial assistance to 272,000 government workers and pensioners at the rate of about P3 million monthly.\r\n\u2014Our committed policy of providing land to the landless through the resettlement of our idle manpower in underdeveloped areas is being implemented by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA). Now 15,000 families are eagerly waiting for their chance to be resettled.\r\nThe Land Tenure Administration last year acquired 16 new landed estates located in different areas.\r\n.\u2014We are faced with the problem of housing for the working masses. For this purpose, I am asking the backing of Congress to an extensive low-cost house-building program in which the active participants are the SSS, the GSIS, the HFC, and the PHHC. This plan envisages a coordinated program of low-cost housing at nominal amortizations within an extended period of from 10 to 30 years to enable every earning laborer-family of the Philippines to own a part of their native land and earn the dignity of being a stockholder in the Philippines body-politic.\r\n.\u2014Through the Social Welfare Administration, the Government has extended material aid to over half a million people. Homeless men and women were resettled from squatter areas. Victims of typhoons, fires, floods, and other public calamities received immediate relief and aid. Self-help projects were developed all over the country. Institutional care was provided for orphans, the aged, and the infirm.\r\nHealth.\u2014The Department of Health has managed to forestall any widespread epidemic throughout the country. It has also reduced morbidity and mortality.\r\nThe Department of Health has been undergoing organizational and structural changes to decentralize and simplify the distribution of services to the greater bulk of our population.\r\nTuberculosis control measures were maintained through chest clinics and mobile preventive teams.\r\nThe malaria control program was expanded with the Filaria Pilot Project and the Regional Malaria Training Center.\r\nNew progress has been made in the field of education with the adoption of the Revised Educational Program, the curricula in the public and private elementary and secondary schools have been enriched and made more responsive to our social and economic needs. Increased emphasis has been given to science, mathematics, and vocational education.\r\nEducational opportunities have been extended to more children and adults than ever before. As a result, our percentage of illiteracy has been reduced from 50 per cent in 1948 to 30 per cent this year.\r\nThe community school program has continued to stimulate and improve community living, principally in the rural areas.\r\nCharacter education and optional religious instruction have been intensified as a way of counteracting juvenile delinquency.\r\nFinancial difficulties have not been fully overcome, however, in giving every child of school age educational opportunities. The increasing number of children applying for admission every year at an average of 500,000 children continually compounds the problem.\r\nIn this connection, we must recognize the role that private schools have in our educational system. Their contribution to the country should be geared at all times to the public interest and their activities attuned to our national objectives.\r\nThere is a definite need of placing on a permanent and sound footing the financing of our educational system.\r\nOur efforts in scientific research and investigations have made some headway with the organization of the National Science Development Board and the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission. As additional funds, are made available for this purpose, scientific and technological researches will be pursued in a systematic manner with a view to harnessing science for the attainment of our economic goals. The objective of increasing the economic utilization of our agricultural and natural resources, of expanding our export products and external markets, as well as of building a reservoir of competent scientists and technologists would be assured.\r\nI am happy to report to you that our Armed Forces have kept faith with our democratic tradition and have continued to serve as a stabilizing force in the health growth of our democratic institutions. Thus, our people are able to dedicate their full energies to productive pursuits in an atmosphere of internal peace.\r\nWith respect to defense preparations for our national security against any potential aggressor, our Armed Forces have improved their defensive effectiveness.\r\nI wish to draw your attention to the need for maintaining at least the nucleus of the Armed Forces whose primary mission should be the training of our manpower potential not only to defend our territory but also to meet such minimum defense requirements as a consequence of commitments with our friends and allies.\r\nDuring the past year, there was an increased output of cases disposed by the courts. The courts of first instance, out of 55,454 cases filed were able to dispose of 48,081, leaving a backlog of 7373 cases. The justice of the peace courts, out of 92,000 cases filed, disposed of 91,000 cases, leaving a backlog of 1,000 cases. The Municipal Court of Manila alone, out of 186,900 cases filed, disposed of 176,474 cases, leaving a backlog of 10,426 cases. But this court made a total collection in fines and fees amount to P880,406.23. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, out of a total 3,079 cases filed, disposed of 1,525 cases leaving a backlog of 1,554 cases.\r\nThese facts manifest a fresh determination of the judiciary to cope with the fast growing number of court cases. Most often, the nature of our judicial processes, as a result of centuries of formalistic rituals, has retarded their disposition. I would therefore commend to the attention of Congress further simplification of judicial procedure to do away with unessential formalities and get to the core of judicial bodies that administer the socio-economic program of the Government. The Court of Industrial Relations, the Court of Agrarian Relation, and the Agricultural Tenancy Commission have contributed in promoting industrial and agrarian peace.\r\nThe Court of Industrial Relations, out of a total of 804 cases filed, disposed of 619, leaving a backlog of 185 cases. It also investigated 413 cases of unfair labor practices. The Court of Agrarian Relations handled during the past year 4,820 cases. Out of these it was able to dispose of 3,000 cases, leaving a backlog of 1,820 cases. However, it was able to serve 41,830 tenants and 9,450 landlords.\r\nThe Agricultural Tenancy Commission handled 3,560 cases and amicably settled 2,045 cases. It rendered a total of 6,400 legal opinions for landlords and tenants and served 9,371 tenants and landlords through its mediation activities.\r\nThe Court of Tax Appeals, out of 165 cases filed, disposed of 79 cases, leaving a backlog of 86 cases.\r\nThere is need for reforms in the penal administration. I note that Congress has taken cognizance of conditions in our national penitentiary and of the need for remedial legislation.\r\nIn our every essay at making our social and economic objectives a fact accomplished, we are hampered by a cancer gnawing at our national entrails. Graft and corruption, I say, is not a political question but a national problem. I do not intend to shirk the responsibility of the Administration, but I propose that we all handle this chronic ailment in the body of our Government as a common problem, the people\u2019s as well as the Government\u2019s\u2014of its executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\r\nThe problem of graft and corruption in the government is not peculiar to our administration in our country. Nor is it a new one. It has plagued all administrations before us. Nevertheless, I do not condone nor minimize the significance of this blight. On the contrary, we in the Administration recognize its existence. We diagnose it. We identify and expose it. We combat it every day. Modesty aside, this Administration has gone farther than any other in the past on this matter by consistently exposing and encouraging exposure of all cases of iniquity. If it seems there are more of such at present, it is because of the unrelenting exposure of it.\r\nI have set no bars to investigations of graft and corruption. I have taken the initiative in ferreting it out wherever it may thrive. The PCAPE and the investigating body at Customs were created for this purpose.\r\nI have consistently insisted on honesty and integrity in the public service and I say again that erring public officials will be dealt with severely but justly. I do not propose to send innocent men to jail just so the Administrations could crow that it has sent people to jail. That would be compounding injustice to injury. But I do propose to deal accordingly with those against whom evidence warrants such action, not only to rid the Government of these undesirables but also to set the example to others who would make of public service a means to ill-gained private wealth.\r\nWe are blessed in this country with the freedom of speech and expression whose potent instrument is the Press. Let the public official live in its searching light, fearing nothing if he has nothing to hide and ever read to defend himself gallantly wherever he is questioned. The Press, however, should focus its searchlight directly on the grafters and the corrupt ones and not hide or forget their identities by blaming the Administration therefore merely for the sake of commercialized sensationalism.\r\nThe all pervasive basic philosophy of our foreign policy is to help secure international peace so that in honor and in freedom we may live in its healthy atmosphere, side by side with other nations on the basis of equality.\r\nIn my first report to you on the state of the nation, I pointed out that our national security was anchored on our own internal strength as well as on our cooperation with the United Nations, buttressed by regional arrangements and by our mutual defense alliance with the United States of America.\r\nWhile it must be candidly admitted that international tensions have not subsided, the effectiveness of our position in that regard has been demonstrated. In spite of the several international crises in 1958, on of which exploded over Quemoy\u2014so close to our shores\u2014the measures and the instrumentalities on which we depended were not found wanting. On the contrary, they did their part in staving off a widespread holocaust.\r\nWe therefore propose to broaden our participation in the United Nations for advancing the cause of world peace. Wit our friends in the United Nations we shall work for this case as truly an equal partner.\r\nWe have to admit realistically, however, that this cause still has a long way to go. The fact that power remains a threat to nations and peoples, because others would use it to dominate them, call for the generation also of defense power to forestall aggression. In this regard, we have to rely on the friends and allies.\r\nOur staunchest friend and ally is America with whom we have a treaty of mutual defense, which even now is being perfected to bring it closer to the ideal basis of sovereign equality.\r\nTo this end, exploratory talks on the diplomatic level are being undertaken to bring into harmony points of divergence on the question of military bases in this country, redefining the mutual defense concept and readjusting Philippine-American defense arrangements with the United States.\r\nWe hope to reach a happy and realistic conclusion of this task this year in a spirit of mutual respect and cordial understanding.\r\nAlready, we have concluded an agreement for the creation of a Mutual Defense Board and the placement of Filipino liaison officers in American bases in the Philippines. We have also concluded another agreement for the complete turn-over to the Philippine Government of American military reservations in the Manila Port area. This agreement has been actually implemented.\r\nIn the regional defense area, the SEATO has unanimously approved at its last Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Manila our Government\u2019s proposal for consultative liaison at Secretariat level among the three regional defense arrangements of the free world\u2014the NATO, the Baghdad Pact, and the SEATO itself.\r\nIn the economic phase of our foreign relations we are continually exploring the capability and suitability of the Colombo Plan for our development requirements.\r\nWithout veering away from America, but rather in pursuit of our own resolution to help in spreading the gospel of democracy in Asia, we have drawn ourselves closer to our immediate neighbors in this part of the globe. Last year, I paid visits of state, first, to the United States, then to Japan. In both countries, I was received with the utmost cordiality and warm friendship as President of the Republic. I feel that, more than anything else, both visits resulted in the priceless boon of closer understanding and mutual esteem between the two countries and ours.\r\nI went to Washington on a goodwill mission, to reaffirm friendship and deeper mutual understanding with the great leader of the Free World. I went to Japan also, on a goodwill mission to manifest a Christian spirit towards a former enemy with whom we would open anew chapter of friendship and amity. We received such a hearty and fervent response from the Japanese Government and people that they broke long established precedents to manifest friendship. In the spirit of friendship the United States and Japan would extend to us a helping hand. We accept this in the same spirit.\r\nIncidental to my trip to Washington, we have been assured of a loan from the Export-Import Bank in the amount of $75 million and $50 million from the Development Loan Fund. Fresh advices from our Washington embassy are to the effect that approval of the release of these loans is forthcoming. We also received assurances that the United States Congress would consider the settlement of the amount due us because of the devaluation of the dollar in 1933. The President of the United States has already recommended the appropriation of the sum to the United States Congress besides economic aid for the Philippines.\r\nWith Japan, we have concluded a cooperative agreement under which the construction of the Marikina multi-purpose project and the extension of the telecommunications system on a nationwide scale would be undertaken.\r\nIn our policy of moving closer to our neighbors in Asia, we have tightened bonds of amity with them to a greater measure than heretofore\u2014with South Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Nationalist China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Burma, and Malaya. The President of South Vietnam and the Prime Minister of Malaya were recently distinguished state visitors of our country. I propose to return such visits as soon as possible. As opportunity offers, I shall visit as many Asian countries as possible to attest in deeds our avowed desire to be their friend and good neighbor.\r\nIn relation to Nationalist China, we have been able to reach a tentative agreement on a diplomatic level on the question of the so-called overstating Chinese visitors in the Philippines. The Chinese Ambassador and our Secretary of Foreign Affairs are finalizing this diplomatic agreement which upholds the pertinent laws of the Philippines while at the same time extending the highest human consideration to a friendly people.\r\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs has implemented the creation of a legation in Rangoon, Burma, the Hague, and Netherland, and the establishment of eight new consider posts in different parts of the world in addition to our already established foreign embassies, legations, and agencies. We propose the creation of separate diplomatic missions in Malaya and Laos.\r\nI would like also to point out the need for continued representation of our country in international conferences and congresses, especially those of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as the international conventions on sugar, abaca, and other export products. These are representations we cannot afford to miss if we must maintain our international prestige and promote our international trade.\r\nToday, the Philippines finds herself in the flux of development in spite of many odds. Among important items in this development being attained may be mentioned the following: (a) the conclusion of agreement with Japan to build the multi-purpose Marikina project to generate industrial power for waterworks and industrial use and will irrigate 6,200 hectares of ricelands; (b) the telecommunications project which will connect the provinces, cities, municipalities and even rural areas to Manila; (c) the completion of the Binga hydroelectric project with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts; (d) the extension of the MRR to Cagayan Valley and Sorsogon with work about to be started; (e) the construction of a Mindanao development road system of almost 800 kilometers, of which 419 kilometers have already been completed; (f) the establishment of a merchant marine to increase our tonnage of foreign shipping through the acquisition of 12 ships by the NDC with a total dead-weight tonnage of 130,000 and an additional tonnage of 35,200 already obtained through the Reparations Agreement, our immediate goal here being 500,000 tons of foreign shipping; and (g) the establishment of new industries in 1958, among the most important of which being the multi-million peso Republic Flour Mill with four others to follow; and (h) the establishment of a ramie processing plant in Davao.\r\nBut with all these we have still to achieve many other advances. We have vaster economic frontiers to explore, other goals to attain, among which may be mentioned the following: (1) the establishment of our integrated steel industry with three units principally in Ilagan where cheap Camarines Norte, and still another one in Angat, Bulacan, for which a loan of $74,000 from the U.S. Export-Import Bank has been solicited and reported due soon; (2) the exploitation of our laterite mines in Surigao; (3) the propulsion of the oil mining industry in Cagayan Valley, Cebu, etc.; (4) the building and intensification of feeder roads in agriculturally developing areas like Mindanao and Cagayan Valle; (5) the building of the Luzon super-highway; (6) the modernization of inter-island shipping with a view to cheapening the fare and improving the service;(7) the construction of adequate modern airports and strengthening of the PAL to enable it to enter in to the international aviation service; (8) the realization of the reclamation projects for Manila, Cebu and other ports; (9) the intensified development of home and cottage industries; (10) the acceleration of production of rubber and cotton; (11) the greater development of fishing, livestock and dairy industries; and (12) the building of the Angat hydro electric project for industrial power, river control, and irrigation to be financed out of the Development Loan Fund of $50 million, also reported for industrial power. It is bigger than the Marikina project. Its reservoir will have a capacity of 696 million cubic meters that will solve the water shortage of Manila and outlying regions now served by the Metropolitan Water District. It will provide water for irrigation of 25,950 hectares of farmland and establish flood control facilities in 18 towns in Bulacan and Pampanga.\r\nThese objectives are the details that achieved and put together, add up to the grand total\u2014the realization of the nation\u2019s aspiration to establish a well balanced agro-industrial economy.\r\nBut let us not lose sight of the fact that the principal limiting factor to the attainment of the goals I succinctly summarized is the supply of foreign exchange. It is in connection with this problem that a more deliberate study should be undertaken. We can, however, take comfort and even pride from the achievement that whereas in 1957 our dollar reserve faced a balance-of-payment deficit of $124 million, in 1958 we brought it down to $17 million. Still it is commonly agreed that we have the imperative need of increasing the supply of dollars. We have the following ways open to us, viz., (1) the further expansion of our export industries; (2) encouragement of the right kind of foreign investment; (3) tapping all possible resources from abroad, including loans and procurement of productive machinery on a deferred payment plan; (4) the abolition of the barter trade and the no-dollar import law; and (5) the utilization of reparations payments to capital investment.\r\nThe procurement of goods and services under the reparation\u2019s program will help finance the foreign exchange needs of our economic development. In 1957-1958 the total goods and services contracted for or procured by the Reparations Commission amounted to over $70 million, of which $42.6 million has been spent to meet the needs of the government projects and $27.4 million channeled to private industry. The Administration\u2019s policy is to allocate in an increasing measure future procurements under the program to meet the needs of the private sector of our national economy. However, in order to ensure the maximum utilization of reparations goods for the realization of the country\u2019s development policies, it is desirable to amend the Reparations Law. Such desirable amendments I shall specify forthwith.\r\nIn view of the foregoing considerations I have the honor to submit for your kind consideration the following recommendations:\r\nAllow me to reiterate with undiminished vigor and emphasis that I am definitely against the devaluation of the peso. This is a measure that may prove beneficial to a handful of privileged classes, but it will certainly bring hardships and suffering to millions of our people. In order to avoid a forced devaluation of a our currency, we must take the necessary measures to stabilize the Government\u2019s fiscal position, by increasing its revenue through a more equitable tax program based on ability to pay, and by enforcing a more efficient and effective collection system. I shall elaborate on the fiscal stabilization program in my forthcoming budget message.\r\nOur present difficulties pose a challenge to the fiscal statesmanship of the Executive and the Congress. We are confronted with two alternatives. The first is to recognize the need for raising revenues for the financing of our expanding economic development program, and then to act boldly and manfully upon that need. The economic development requirements for which we must find financial support are as diverse as they are essential to our continued progress and well-being.\r\nWe must build up our maritime fleet, both domestic and foreign. We must push on our irrigation program. We have to build roads and bridges over agricultural and mining areas to connect them with ports. As a necessary step towards genuine industrialization, we have to set up an integrated steel manufacturing industry. We must carry on such projects as the construction of feeder roads in rural areas; the development of industrial power y harnessing waterfalls and rivers; the improvement of ports and harbors; the undertaking of reclamation work and river control; the installation of waterworks and artesian wells, etc.\r\nWe also need financing for our progressively expanding social services; such as, community development projects in the rural areas, the program of providing land to the landless through such instrumentalities as the NARRA and the Land Tenure Administration, and the program of giving homes to the homeless through such agencies as the PHHC, the Home Financing Commission, the Social Security System, and the GSIS. We must keep the channels of easy and accessible credit open to our small farmers and traders through the Home Financing Commission, the Social Security System, and the GSIS. We must keep the channels of easy and accessible credit open to our small farmers and traders through the ACCFA, the rural banks network, and the Development Bank of the Philippines. We have to continue helping the Filipino businessman through such instrumentalities as the NAMARCO and the Retailers Fund. The education of our school-age population, which is increasing at the rate of 500,000 yearly, is a responsibility that we intend to discharge fully.\r\nAll these, as I have said, will require adequate support and financing, and we have the choice of rising up to this challenge and measuring up to this opportunity by exercising fiscal statesmanship of the highest order.\r\nThe other alternative we may choose is to refuse to raise the revenues necessary to support our program and in effect adopt a policy of stagnation.\r\nI know that in this momentous hour of decision the resounding answer of Congress to the challenge will be for progress\u2014never retrogression; for growth\u2014never economic atrophy; for dynamic development\u2014not stagnation. It will be for social uplift, for economic stability and security, and for the general well-being of the Filipino people, at any cost.\r\nI recommend strongly the consideration and approval of amendments to our Constitution called for by our accumulated experience and changing conditions since this document came into effect more than two decades ago.\r\nI recommend approval of the amendments necessary to bring about the synchronization of elections, national and local, once every four years.\r\nI recommend that senators be elected on the basis of specific senatorial districts. Let the conservative and stabilizing role of the Senate in our bicameral system be maintained by extending eight-year terms to its members, one-half of whom will be chosen by the electorate every quadrennial election.\r\nI recommend that the 30-day period given to the President within which to approve or veto bills passed by Congress be reckoned, in the case of every bill, from the date of its submittal to the President and not from the date of the adjournment of session.\r\nIt is likewise recommended that, in the event the annual general appropriation act for an ensuring fiscal year is not approved, the general appropriation act for the current fiscal year should be deemed continued in force, until such time as the new fiscal year\u2019s budget is passed.\r\nI recommend that a Presidential Electoral Tribunal be provided for in our Constitution and not in an ordinary act to hear and decide protests in connection with presidential elections.\r\nFinally, the provision on the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus may be re-examined to attune it to the spirit of democracy.\r\nI am aware that some of you may be interested in other Constitutional amendments besides those I have just recommended. May I counsel, however, that since Constitutional amendments require for their approval the three-fourths vote of all the members of both chambers of Congress, we should concentrate our efforts for the present on those changes that best enjoy the prospect of approval, leaving controversial amendments to further study and crystallization of opinion.\r\nThe implementation of Republic Act No. 1410, more popularly known as the No-Dollar Import Law or the Barter Trade Law, has resulted in the drainage of our Barter Trade Law, has resulted in the drainage of our dollars at a rate roughly estimated at $80 million a year.\r\nLikewise, the duty-free importation of so-called personal effects by returning residents has opened the way to flagrant abuses and frauds, thus depriving the government of badly needed revenues. It has offered new temptations to graft and corruption.\r\nThe operation of this law has given rise furthermore to over-shipment, down-grading, and under-pricing of exports and over-pricing of imports, enabling the perpetrators of these evil practices to \u201csalt away\u201d in foreign countries millions of dollars that should have gone to our reserves.\r\nTo do away with these evils and abuses, it is strongly recommended that Act No. 1410 be repealed and all the offices created under it, abolished.\r\nIn place of the barter trade authorized under Republic Act No. 1410, whose repeal I have just recommended for the purpose of opening up new and expanding other markets for our products in addition to the American market, I propose the institution or creation of a multi-currency reserve in the Central Bank. It is true that the power to create a multi-currency reserve is already vested in the Central Bank by its charter, Republic Act No. 265. But I believe that such an action of far-reaching national and even international consequences should bear the stamp of legislative authority, and it is for this reason that I am placing this recommendation before you.\r\nI strongly recommend the re-examination of Republic Act No. 901, more popularly known as the Tax Exemption Law for new and necessary industries, in order to check the abuses that have been committed under its protective mantle.\r\nIt has been discovered that many holders of certificates of tax exemption have not actually established their industries, but have nevertheless exercised the privilege of importing commodities duty-free which, instead of being applied to their industries, are sold like ordinary imports at great profit. These holders of certificates of tax exemption, by the collusive practice of \u201cpurchase in transit\u201d have facilitated non-tax-exempt traders to import duty-free goods worth millions of pesos, thus depriving the government of so much customs revenues. It is also well known that many tax-exempt industries are not keeping proper books of accounts, and have placed themselves beyond the reach of BIR examiners.\r\nThere is therefore a clear need to re-examine the Tax-Exemption Law in order to curb these abuses and stop loss of revenues. We must bear in mind that the principal objective for which this law was approved, which was to stimulate and encourage the establishment of industries in our country and thus hasten our industrialization, has been more than realized. As a matter of fact, we have reached a point where our foreign exchange reserves can now hardly keep pace with the requirements of newly established industries. The grant of the precious privilege of tax exemption must now be narrowed down to very exceptional and meritorious cases.\r\nRepublic Act No. 1394, popularly known as the Special Import Tax, provides so many exceptions from its provisions that, where we expected to collect some $70 million, we actually took in only a meager amount last year. The extraordinary number of exceptions contained in this act was in fact the principal cause of the heavy decrease in customs collections during the year under review.\r\nI therefore recommend a re-examination of this act with a view to eliminating those self-defeating exceptions.\r\nIn the implementation of Republic Act No. 1789, better known as the Reparations Law, we have found that the grace period of 24 months given to reparations beneficiaries before they are required to make an initial payment has made it difficult for the Reparations Commission to comply with its obligation under the law to distribute reparations proceeds among various entities; such as, the rural banks, the Manila Railroad company, the veterans\u2019 trust funds, the Land Tenure Administration, etc. Besides preventing the Reparations commission from fulfilling these commitments, the grace period also would give an end-use free use of reparations goods for a period of two years, after which he may return them to the government already deteriorated or depreciated. The government clearly will be the loser in such an eventuality.\r\nIt is therefore urgent and necessary that an amendment to the Reparations Law be approved to eliminate the grace period and to require a certain amount of down payment to guarantee good faith on the part of the end-user and protect the interest of the government.\r\nWe must also prohibit reparations applicants and end-users from negotiation directly with Japanese suppliers. This practice can facilitate collusion between the two parties to over-price reparations goods, to the prejudice of the Philippine Government. All procurement negotiations for reparations should be conducted directly and only by the Philippine Reparations Mission.\r\nAnother amendment I am recommending is to charge a service fee on both government and private reparations transactions, so as to provide adequate funds for the operational expenditures of the Reparations Commission officers and employees from the requirements of the WAPCO law on position classification and rates of pay.\r\nFinally, I recommend that in Section 2, subsection (1) of the Reparations Act, the clause \u201centities wholly owned by Filipino citizens\u201d be changed to \u201centities controlled by Filipino citizens.\u201d The suggested amendment would put more practical and realistic nationalism into the law rather than adhere to a puritan nationalism which oftentimes is self-defeating.\r\nAs you all know, Republic Act No. 698 as amended, or the Virginia Leaf Tobacco Act, requires the ACCFA to extend price support to all grades and kinds of Virginia tobacco produced in the country. This has encouraged the production of low grade Virginia tobacco which, however, finds no market among cigarette manufacturers. As a result, stocks of low-grade Virginia tobacco are accumulated, and the net effect is that a sizable amount of invested capital and ACCFA funds is frozen.\r\nIf this accumulation of unmarketable tobacco is allowed to continue unchecked, in due time the entire government price support fund intended to assist the Virginia tobacco industry will be tied up in these stocks, thus frustrating the noble purpose of the law. Production of Virginia tobacco industry will be tied up in these stocks, thus frustrating the noble purpose of the law. Production of Virginia tobacco is growing by leaps and bounds, and very soon the industry will require larger amounts from the government for the maintenance of the price support program. Even now, the point of exhaustion of ACCFA funds for the purchase of tobacco has almost been reached.\r\nWe must see to it, therefore, that these funds are not dissipated in buying unmarketable tobacco but are used rather for the purchase of high-grade tobacco. We will thus encourage the production of high-grade Virginia tobacco and at the same time discourage the growth of unmarketable low\u2013grade tobacco. I therefore recommend that the tobacco price-support law be amended to exclude low-grade tobacco from its coverage.\r\nI must bring to the attention of Congress that the backpay sinking fund has an actual deficiency of more that P100 million. This is the result of two factors. First, there was a wrong estimate of the amount needed for backpay when Act No. 897 was passed by Congress in 1953, and the second factor is the ruling of the Department of Justice in 1954 which reduced the period of redemption from 30 years to 10 years, thereby upsetting the actuarial computation of the sinking fund.\r\nTo cover up this deficiency, I therefore propose the appropriation of P21 million a year for 10 years to build up the backpay sinking fund, and the extension for five years of the period which expired on June 30, 1958.\r\nThe Administration has launched a relentless drive against graft and corruption in the government. It has done its utmost to identify and expose corruption. But of course the professional cynics and hecklers are always trying to cast doubts on the sincerity of the Administration in this crusade, by insinuating that the Executive, being the chief of all the investigative bodies, can quash a case or exonerate a defendant whenever he wants or convict even the innocent when he so desires, irrespective of the merits of a case. It is also insinuated that members of Congress can influence investigative or fact-finding bodies. The obstructionists further allege that these investigative bodies are political tools of the Administrative designed to protect its prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and harass its adversaries.\r\nTo silence these destructive voices and re-emphasize once more our determination to sweep out graft and corruption in the government, I am recommending the creation of an anti-graft tribunal to constitute a part of the judicial department of the government, independent of the Executive and Congress. It is my hope and challenge that with the creation of this special court, those who possess evidence of graft or corruption in the public service, committed or perpetrated by whomsoever he may be, instead of engaging in loose talks, generalities, and malicious innuendos, will go to this court to discharge this civic responsibilities and do their duty as citizens to cooperate in the maintenance of an honest officialdom and civil service.\r\nIn connection with the desire to improve the quality of public service, may I recommend the expansion of the present School of Public Administration managed by the U.P. into a college where training for high government executive and managerial positions may be given, as well as specialized training for municipal and provincial service. Clerical efficiency can be raised by training in this college. But more important still, this college should emphasize character building and moral education in order to raise a legion of specially trained and efficient men of strong moral fibre to man our public service and administration.\r\nTo put an end to the yearly public school crisis, it is advisable that the present method of financing our elementary and secondary schools be re-examined so as to place it on a stable basis. It is my considered view that our public education system should be supported with revenues exclusively dedicated to such a purpose. I am certain that Filipino parents are willing to go to any lengths for the sake of the education of their children. Provided they see that every centavo contributed by them for school expense is invested wisely in this program, they will gladly bear their full share of the burden in raising the revenues needed to maintain in this country the highest standards of education.\r\nThe Administration will propose for your consideration a draft bill embodying this recommendation.\r\nOur present laws regulating the relations between the national government and the local governments are no longer realistic, nor are they in keeping with the needs of the times. Local governments are not self-supporting units and depend too much upon aids or shares from the national government. It is because of this situation that the initiative for their progress or improvement has to come all the way from the national government. We cannot allow this state of affairs to continue.\r\nLocal governments should be given more autonomy and by local autonomy is meant that any increase in their authority should go hand in hand with increased responsibility. In other words, local governments should assume greater responsibility in supporting and financing their local affairs if they wish to exercise greater authority in the management thereof.\r\nTo give this problem the attention and care that it deserves, I propose that a commission be created to study sweeping reforms in the administration of provincial and municipal governments and to recommend appropriate measures to carry them out along the lines I have indicated.\r\nA number of cases have come to our attention of public officials as well as officers and employees of government owned and controlled corporations entering into business deals, contracts, or transactions involving the use of public funds which were irregular, anomalous unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant. In the purchase or procurement of government supplies and materials, for instance, a number of cases of overpricing have been discovered. We have also learned of purchases of stocks of government supplies and materials far beyond the quantities necessary.\r\nBesides overpricing and overstocking, there are other corrupt practices in government offices and corporations which have caused a considerable drain on public funds. Millions of the people\u2019s money have been misspent or lost in this manner. In most cases these acts were discovered long after the damage to the public treasury had been done.\r\nWe must act to prevent, or at least to minimize, these corrupt practices. In this direction, it is recommended that the Auditor General be empowered to look into, even before their consummation, contract, deals, transactions, and negotiations involving public funds or property which in his opinion appear to be irregular, anomalous, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant. He should also be given the power to take all necessary measures to prevent the execution or continuance of such contracts, transactions, or deals. Furthermore, he shall be charged with the duty of bringing them to the attention of the President.\r\nIn this connection, it has been observed that the performance of the General Auditing Office leaves plenty of room for improvement in the discharge of its duties and functions relative to anomalous or excessive expenditures of public funds or property, as imposed upon that office by Section 2, Article XI of the Constitution. It is said that this has been due to deficiency of personnel. If so, let the General Auditing Office be provided with the necessary personnel to carry out the new duties and preventive powers hereby recommended.\r\nGentlemen of the Congress, let me say in conclusion, that the faith of this nation is deep and abiding; the spirit of this nation is mighty; the determination of this nation is invincible. On this rock of faith, and with this spirit and this determination, let us build the House of the Nation so that it may be said: \u201cAnd the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall because it was founded on rock.\u201d", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},

Garcia", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 23, 1961]\r\n\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\nIt is with deep satisfaction and warranted optimism that I now open the fourth regular session of this Congress. For during the year 1960 Divine Providence has made it possible for us as a nation to attain new summits in our unending Odyssey in the highway of progress and development. Our success has deepened our faith and heightened our hope that the Philippine Republic will live to attain its sublime national Destiny.\r\nAs we lurch forward into the future, we derive new strength and fresh inspiration by surveying the horizon we have traversed during the year under review. We see that we have reached new heights of prosperity and development as a result of our momentous decision to enact into legislative mandates the fiscal stabilization measures which we implemented vigorously.\r\nThus under the stewardship of the Nacionalista administration:\r\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Philippines chalked up a new high in dollar reserve standing at $205 million during the last quarter of 1960 after paying our short term foreign obligations in the amount of $84 million.\r\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our gross national product has registered a spectacular increase by P600 million in 1960 and stands at an estimated level of P10.8 billion as against P10.2 billion in 1959.\r\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our favorable balance of payments which we lost during and after the war, and which we regained only beginning 1959, has continue to rise in 1960 in the amount of around, $30 million, and the reserve, as of December 31, 1960, stands at $192 million as against $162 million in 1959;\r\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We continue to have a balanced budget and even a surplus in the general funds,\r\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our peso both here and abroad is steadily gaining in strength, rising from P4.10 to the dollar in 1959 to P3.20 to the dollar beginning December of 1960;\r\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because of the success of the stabilization program which went even beyond our most sanguine expectation to the chagrin and discomfiture of the prophets of doom, we were able to start in April 1960 the Administration\u2019s four-year decontrol program. Even before the year ended, we began the second stage of decontrol and all indications are that we will complete in two years the four-year decontrol program and, God willing, by 1962 our national economy shall be completely free;\r\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the moral aspect of our national life, I am happy to report that our campaign against graft and corruption has achieved an unprecedented record. In the year reviewed we had in round figures 22,000 administrative cases and decided 14,000 cases with 9,500 convictions and 4,000 exonerations. The rest are still pending. A total of 740 criminal cases were filed.\r\nIn general, it can be said without fear of successful contradiction that the year 1960 has been a year of signal achievements in many fields, specially in economics; it marked perceivable advances in our international prestige, and the sun and stars of our flag are shining brighter.\r\nThe great improvement in our fiscal position is a high point of the year just past. Easily its most encouraging aspect is a budgetary surplus in the general fund.\r\nCustoms and internal revenue collection had a combined increase of P151.7 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960. To this increase, Customs contributed P101.9 million and Internal Revenue, P49.8 million.\r\nFrom July 1 to December 31, 1960, actual collections of the two agencies totaled P676.3 million, representing an increase of P55.8 million over those of the corresponding period last year. This is an indication that collections for the current fiscal year will surpass that of 1960.\r\nThese marked increases in revenue collections were achieved as result of a determined campaign against graft and corruption and of reforms in the Bureau of Internal Revenue and in the Bureau of Customs.\r\nDespite an increase of about 13 per cent in our imports as against only a 10 per cent increase in our exports, we continued to improve the favorable balance-of-payments position we achieved in 1959 for the first time in decades. This encouraging trend has in turn raised our international reserve to a new high of $205 million during the last quarter of 1960.\r\nThe recovery of the economy has been made possible mainly by the successful implementation of the stabilization program, the principal features of which were the margin fee and budgetary retrenchment measures.\r\nAs part of the stabilization program and as a prerequisite to decontrol, we continued the monetary restriction during the early part of 1960 in order to hold down prices and maintain the international reserve.\r\nSince the margin levy, the major measure of the stabilization program, went into effect about the middle of 1959, the external value of the peso has continued to increase. In July and August, 1959, the free market value of our currency was as low as P4.10 to $1.00; as of December 1960 it has improved to P3.20 to $1.00. The drop in 1959 was partly due to the increased demand for foreign exchange born of our efforts to accelerate industrialization. However, the margin levy, associated with a more discriminate foreign exchange allocation and selective credit policies and the exercise of greater fiscal restraints, has brought about a continuing improvement in the external value of the peso.\r\nExternal confidence in our economy has been so enhanced that foreign banks have gone as far as offering loans for economic development both to our government and to private investors. This puts to shame the self-proclaimed prophets of doom who had greeted our proposed economic stabilization measures with dire predictions of economic disaster.\r\nThe success of the stabilization program in solidifying and strengthening our internal and external financial position encouraged the Administration to consider the relaxation of restrictions and controls.\r\nIn April of last year, we launched a four-year program of lifting monetary and trade controls aimed at the full restoration of free enterprise eventually. Its first phase called for the creation of a free market for foreign exchange equivalent to approximately one-fourth of all foreign receipts and payments. The results were so encouraging that the second phase was made effective much ahead of schedule, barely six months later. The expanded the free foreign exchange market to approximately one-half. We expect to attain complete decontrol within this year of 1961, thereby completing decontrol in two years instead of four.\r\nAs we approach the stage of full decontrol, there is need for reexamining authorized exemptions form the margin levy, which will ultimately result in a unified equilibrium of exchange rate.\r\nFull decontrol may obviously be accompanied by an increase in price of imports, but it will create conditions favorable for the establishment of new industries to increase production for export and employment and, in the long run, stabilize prices. With the savings of foreign exchange resulting from the reduction of imports of consumer goods, we shall have more resources available for the importation of machineries and equipment to expand industrial production.\r\nComplementary to decontrol is credit relaxation. Among other measures, rediscount rates and the bank reserve requirements have been reduced and cash deposit requirement for letters of credit for imports has been abolished. The overall result has been a substantial increase in credit available to the business sector.\r\nOutstanding loans for commercial and savings banks rose from P1.96 billion at the end of 1959 to P2.07 billion at the end of September 1960, or an increase of P110 million in nine months.\r\nThere are also continuing increases in agricultural and industrial production, electric power output, transportation and, accordingly, employment and earnings. Agricultural crop yield in 1960 rose by 3 per cent over the preceding year\u2019s level.\r\nThe industrial program gained further headway as manufacturing production reached new peaks of output in 1960. It expanded another 8.3 per cent, surpassing the previous year\u2019s gain of 7.8 per cent. Electric power output rose by 80 per cent during the first nine months of 1960 over that of the corresponding period of 1959.\r\nAs a result of the expanded industrial and agricultural production the gross national product increased from P10.2 billion in 1959 to an estimated P10.8 billion in 1960 or a rise of P600 million. This represents a six per cent increase over the rate of increase of the gross national product in 1959 over that of 1958.\r\nAccordingly, there has been a continuing growth in employment. When I took over in 1957 the employed labor force was estimated by the Bureau of Census and Statistics at 8,149,000. In 1959 the employment figure rose to 8,959,000 or an increase of 810 laborers. The increased economic activities in 1960 as evidenced by the marked improvement in the gross national product indicates an even higher level of employment in 1960.\r\nThe economic stability that we have achieved is due no less to our economic development policy.\r\nIn the agricultural sector, we have pursued the highest priority national objective of self-sufficiency in rice and corn. For this purpose, we have maintained he annual appropriation of P20 million.\r\nEmphasis is being given to abaca and coconut, two of our major export products. To rehabilitate the abaca industry, we are inaugurating a balanced program aimed-at restoring our abaca production to its prewar level of one million bales a year. I urge the appropriation of P20 million for this purpose.\r\nIn a effort to discover the means of eradicating cadang-cadang which seriously threatens he coconut industry, research is being intensified by all agencies concerned. For the general development of the industry, I am directing the release of P10 million out of the appropriation of P30 million which has already been provided for the purpose.\r\nIt is time that we step up the development of the livestock industry through the enactment of appropriate legislation. At present our meat and milk production meets only 15 per cent of the national requirement. We have to import P48 million worth of meat, milk and dairy products each year. The need for assuring an adequate supply of these vital food product calls for serious efforts to develop the livestock industry.\r\nThere is need for stepping up the pace towards increasing fish production from the deep seas. The Philippines tuna resources are among the richest in the world. Let us exploit them.\r\nI recommend the establishment of a Deep-Sea Fishing Administration for the purpose of encouraging, coordinating and assisting the development by the private sector of deep-sea fishing. Accordingly, the Development Bank of the Philippines should set aside no less than P10 million a year for this purpose.\r\nWhile it is wise to encourage the utilization of our forest resources, we have it necessary to look into their conservation and effective exploitation. Scientific management of commercial forest areas through selective logging has been intensified. For a better implementation of our program of planting trees on denuded watersheds, grasslands and marginal lands, the Reforestation Administration has been established.\r\nTo give more force to the laws against illegal deforestation, I urge the amendment of Section 267 of the National Internal Revenue Code so that logs illegally cut shall be subject to confiscation even after the payment of fines.\r\nI desire to place squarely before this Congress the matter of reconciling our policies in the interest of the development not only of the Virginia tobacco but also of the native tobacco industry. The United States is now disposed to welcome the entry of cigars and other tobacco products from the Philippines as a result of her cutting economic ties with Cuba. However, let us not forget that under the prohibitions of Republic Act No. 1194, we do not welcome American tobacco here, and we can hardly expect the United States to be hospitable to our tobacco.\r\nThe opportunity of gaining a permanent foothold in the American market for the Philippine cigar industry has presented itself as a result of recent developments and we must seize its opportunity now or we lose it forever.\r\nIt would therefore be to the interest of the Philippine tobacco industry that Congress reexamine the commercial restrictions in Republic Act No. 1194 without, however, unduly prejudicing the local Virginia tobacco industry with a view to establishing on a mutually profitable and reciprocal basis the Philippine-American tobacco trade.\r\nIn connection with cigar manufacture, it may be necessary that government policy should encourage mechanization of cigar making if we hope to fill our cigar quota in the American market to the tune of 180 million cigars of which we have only filled the meager amount of six million cigars.\r\nEven more significant and decisive strides have been made in the field of industrial development.\r\nIn food processing, two wheat flour mills and three milk canning plants are now in operation. Three additional flour mills will start this year. The goal for the production of cotton textiles is 300 million yards a year. Spinning and weaving capacity is being rapidly expanded towards this end. The ramie textile mills in Davao will soon be in operation.\r\nTo step up the supply of building materials, five new cement factories have been approved during the last two years. Already cement prices have gone down. Now the cementing of all our highways will be made feasible. Soon we may export this product.\r\nCentrifugal sugar production is also expected to increase with the additional sugar quota for the Philippines to the tune of half million (500,000) tons. In this connection, I am glad to announce that necessary credit facilities have been extended by the Philippine National Bank with the support of the Central Bank and the Development of the Philippines to permit the ready expansion in sugar production and take advantage of the opportunity of increasing the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings in the amount of about $60 million. All in all, the total amount of sugar we have to export to the United States this year is 1.4 million tons. We have to produce this or lose the additional quota.\r\nWe are also aiming at self-sufficiency in the production of pulp and paper. We have now an aggregate annual capacity of 95,200 tons of paper and 9,500 tons of pulp. The additional pulp and paper mills will raise production to the level of national requirement. Our other important objective is to produce newsprint paper.\r\nWe are also stepping up production of acetic acid, soda ash and caustic soda. We have established a sheet glass factory and three glass container factories.\r\nFuel production registered a substantial expansion. The most notable development in this field is the construction of three new petroleum refineries in addition to one already in operation.\r\nThis administration is determined to realize its major project of establishing integrated steel plants. It has encouraged and supported the participation of the private sector in this industry. The private segment of our economy has made initial investment towards owning 49% of the capitalization. Private participation in the Iligan project calls for appropriate amendments of the charter of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation which I strongly recommend.\r\nTo provide greater stimulus for the industrial development program, it is essential that appropriate business incentives he provided for. Fiscal measures are necessary to reduce the initial burden incident to the establishment of new enterprise.\r\nThe establishment of basic industries requires large capital investments. To lighten the initial burden, I recommend legislation granting basic industries full exemption from duties and taxes on their initial fixed capital requirements.\r\nTo improve the position of Filipino firms and corporations resulting from certain weaknesses in their capital structure and to provide incentives to all investors, other assistance measures should be approved by Congress.\r\nOn the other hand, there are certain industries which have been granted incentives under the Barter Law. Prior to decontrol, products of these industries could not be exported for dollars profitably. With the present rate of exchange under the second phase of decontrol, the need for such an arrangement no longer exists. I therefore, recommend the repeal of the Barter Law.\r\nWith regard to the restrictive provisions of the mining petroleum and corporation laws which deter the full development of our mining industries, I urge that measures be considered to relax them.\r\nTo undertake effectively the development program, we must expand and modernize transportation, communications, power and irrigation systems.\r\nTo expand our overseas shipping facilities the National Development Company procured 12 ocean-going vessels, nine of which have been delivered. Two interisland vessels have been constructed by the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation. We are modernizing the Government Telephone System on a national scale. We have acquired the right-of-way for the extension of the Manila Railroad lines to Cagayan and Sorsogon and it is expected that construction work will begin before June 30 this year.\r\nThe age of cement roads has come to the Philippines. It is high time that the main highways traversing the various agricultural and industrial areas (about 15,000 km. long) be paved with cement o reduce the cost of maintenance. The use of cement instead of asphalt in the construction of our roads will be far more economical in the long run. Local cement production will soon be expanded so as to bring down the price thereof and enable the government to undertake this ambitious project. I urge that Congress consider the adoption of a program cementing our national highways. To finance the initial phase of this project, I recommend the appropriation for the next fiscal year of the amount of P35 million. This will enable us this year to pave with cement at least 350 kilometers of our national highways to be apportioned in the following manner: 150 kilometers for Luzon, 100 kilometers for Visayas and 100 kilometers for Mindanao. This apportionment is in line with the industrial dispersal policy of this Administration.\r\nIn this connection, offers of private corporation or contractors to build for the government portions of the cement road system, under special terms or deferred payment plan, should be welcomed and accommodated.\r\nIndustrial power output has been increased by 265,000 kilowatts due mainly to the operation of the Binga Hydro electric project. Studies for four other hydroelectric projects with a total capacity of 359,000 kilowatts have been completed.\r\nThe bulk of the credit facilities and dollar allocations has been extended to industries in Manila and suburbs. I have directed a study on the dispersal of the industries supported by basic facilities. Our policy in this connection is to give priority to the area with the greatest potential. Priority should be given to the systematic development of Mindanao because of its tremendous natural resources and because it is the least developed among the three groups.\r\nThe financial resources required for economic development at the rate necessary to sustain a continuing growth will call for the tapping of idle savings and channeling them to productive investments. Towards this end, public policies should learn from the experience of more advanced countries by encouraging the establishment of investment houses quite distinct from the mutual funds. This will further strengthen the financial basis of the economy and assure sources of long-term funds for desirable productive ventures.\r\nEven as we are making provisions for expanding production, we have attended to increasing outlets for our output. We have promoted foreign trade both to expand the demand for our traditional exports and create foreign markets for new products.\r\nIn implementing the Retail Trade Nationalization Act, the Department of Commerce and Industry registered and assisted a great number of new Filipino retailers. This Congress also passed during the last session the Rice and Corn Trade Nationalization Law.\r\nThe role of non-agricultural cooperatives in the economy has gained added strength with the establishment of the Philippine National Cooperative Bank.\r\nAt present, there are a number of agencies with which businessmen have to deal in setting up an enterprise. In order to serve their needs, especially those of foreign investors, a law should be enacted centralizing these functions under one office.\r\nI also recommend to revision of the General Banking Act to delimit the share of foreigners in jointly owned banks.\r\nI propose the amendment of Republic Act No 1130 to abolish the Anti-Dummy Board and to transfer its function to the Department of Justice.\r\nWithout detracting from the policy to strengthen the position of Filipinos in economic activities, I consider it essential for the purpose of pushing the economy into a self sustaining momentum that we attract foreign capital to a greater measure than it has flowed into the country.\r\nHowever, to attract foreign investment, it is necessary to provide for it a favorable climate, including the protection of foreign investors against non-business risks and assurance of an equitable treatment.\r\nThis year, as already announced, is \u201cSee the Philippines Visit the Orient Year.\u201d For the convenience of tourists, our national airport is being modernized to make it suitable for jet travel. With this we expect to attract more tourists. But we must spend for the establishment of necessary tourist attractions and facilities. Our national trait of hospitality to our foreign visitors should be made manifest in and through Customs, immigration Office, Visa Office, hotels, taxis, trains, and other transportation media, and by the people themselves. We are determined to make our income from tourism among the biggest items contributing to our dollar reserve.\r\nI consider it urgent that we take a closer look at the financial shortcomings of our public school system.\r\nIn line with my previous recommendation to reexamine the present method of financing our primary and secondary schools, propose the enactment of the Stabilization of School Financing Bill.\r\nThis bill provides for a partnership plan among the national, provincial, municipal and city governments in the financing of public primary and secondary education. Obviously, the additional financing responsibilities that shall be borne by the local governments would call for permissive legislation authorizing provincial and municipal governments to adopt measures to provide funds for adequate school maintenance.\r\nTo correct the acute shortage of textbooks we initiated a textbook printing project to print 35 million textbooks at a cost of P47 million, plus $5.9 million as counterpart.\r\nPrivate schools continue to play an important role in education. They accommodate 60 per cent of the secondary students and 90 per cent of those on the college and graduate levels. To the end that the highest standards of instruction possible may be maintained, an increase in the supervisory personnel is necessary. Supervision over private educational institutions in secondary and collegiate levels may be participated in by a Committee or Board elected by such private institutions. I urge legislative consideration of the idea to grant qualified private educational institutions a margin of curricular freedom to allow educational diversity in educational unity.\r\nThe University of the Philippines has maintained its traditional role of setting national standards for scholarship and research. More liberal financial support would enable it to intensify and expand its program of graduate studies and research and, what is more important, to enable it to embark on extension work of participating actively in community development.\r\nWe have intensified the national effort to improve the foundation of our scientific progress and we have encouraged science consciousness. We have maintained the science scholarship program. Arrangements are being made to establish a science high school in Manila. The U.P. College of Agriculture is gradually being recognized as the training institution for Asia in agricultural science. The establishment in Los Ba\u00f1os of the International Rice Research Institute will make the Philippines the center of scientific efforts to improve he industry that produces all of Asia\u2019s staple food.\r\nWith the establishment of the Philippine Atomic Research Center, the production of isotopes for uses in agriculture, industry and medicine is not far off.\r\nIn connection with the installation of the reactor in the Philippine Atomic Research Center, I recommend the passage of the Indemnity Bill which was introduced in last year\u2019s session of Congress.\r\nTo stabilize the national research program, I also urge Congress to consider the utilization of a portion of the proceeds from the foreign exchange levy to assure continuous financing of important research projects.\r\nThe Administration has given relief to and alleviated the plight of about 900,000 victims\r\nof disaster and calamities. We also met the problems of juvenile delinquency, the physically handicapped, the infirm and the aged, the squatters and beggars. Some 40,000 individuals were helped to find new homes in more suitable surrounding or sent back to the provinces or to NARRA settlements. Additional efforts to relocate squatters are in progress. The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes has raised great amounts of funds for social welfare activities. The broadening of the scope of its benefits should be considered by Congress.\r\nToday, almost four million people are enjoying the protection and benefits of the Social Security System for the private sector and the Government Service Insurance System for the government sector. These two systems also assist our economic development since a large portion of their resources is being channeled to productive investments in various sectors of our economy.\r\nAgricultural workers are now covered under the Social Security System. They have a right to benefit from the enlightened and altruistic provisions of the Social Security Act.\r\nThe problem of providing low-cost housing for our wage-earners, particularly in urban areas, continues to be a major concern of this Administration. The Home Financing Commission, the People\u2019s Homesite and Housing Corporation and the National Urban Planning Commission should coordinate their efforts behind a bold long-range housing program for the masses. We must encourage the participation of private enterprise in this essential program. The Social Security System should embark on a low cost housing project for the benefit of its members.\r\nThis Administration has maintained its deep concern for labor\u2019s rights. During the last three years about P11 million were paid to aggrieved workers and employees.\r\nWith the establishment of four additional regional offices and the organization of the Women and Minors Bureau within the current fiscal year as already authorized by Congress, our Workmen\u2019s welfare will be further promoted.\r\nThe Apprenticeship Division has lately been expanded into a full-fledged office, indicating the importance this Administration gives to skills development. In view of the fact that Asian Economic Development Fund support for the project will cease this year, I urge the appropriation of an adequate sum to continue the operation of the Labor Market Information and Statistics Service Project.\r\nIn 1960, 283 new unions were organized and registered and 193 collective bargaining agreements were recorded. The fact that there were only 44 strikes in 1960 as against 59 strikes as the annual average during the preceding three years is an eloquent evidence of the growing contentment in the labor ranks, and of better relationship and understanding between management and labor. With the increasing acceptance by employers of the institution of collective bargaining, industrial peace has been greatly enhanced.\r\nSignificantly, through the favorable policies of the present administration, economic activities since 1953 have been so expanded as to accommodate an additional 2.2 million workers, thereby reducing unemployment from 1.4 million or 17 per cent of the labor force in 1953 to only 750,000 or 7.7 per cent of the labor force in 1959.\r\nPublic health and sanitation services were further extended to the rural areas. Most of the diseases which have been the common causes of death are under control. Marked decrease was noted in the death rate as well as in the infant morality rate.\r\nHospital services have been improved. Rural health units have continued to minister to the needs of the masses. The Government has upgraded the standards of services.\r\nMore and more funds are needed in order to fully provide in the rural areas medical service and health facilities.\r\nThis Administration has from the start considered our rural inhabitants a special focus of our ameliorative efforts. Accordingly, we have taken every possible step to increase the rate if development in the rural areas.\r\nWe have revitalized the agencies dealing with rural credit and cooperative marketing. The operations of the rural banks have been expanded. We have devoted a substantial part of the resources of the Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines to affording credit on reasonable terms to small farmers. The latter has set aside P50 million for small loans. Rural banks have increased to 150 at the end of 1960. We accelerated the grants of land patents and homesteads and the resettlement efforts of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration. An international Rural Reconstruction Institute to be established in Cavite is designed to be the training center of future rural reconstruction leaders from Asia and Latin America. It is bound to have far-reaching effects on our rural reconstruction and community development.\r\nThe establishment last year of the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Institute at Los Ba\u00f1os is another milestone inn our efforts to revitalize and improve the management of credit and cooperative organizations serving the rural areas.\r\nThe Office of the Presidential Assistant on Community Development (PACD) is proving to be an effective instrumentality in the promotion of the welfare of the rural masses. In the short span of four years, the PACD has become a vital factor in the economic, social and cultural progress of our country by reawakening in our people on rural areas their capacity for self-help and an awareness of their ability to recognize their own problems and adopt measures for their solution.\r\nWhere once existed barrios wrapped in apathy and a sense of hopelessness, there now thrive invigorated communities inspired by democratic grassroots leadership\u2014a strong guarantee against the inroads of Communism.\r\nFrom an initial coverage of 22 provinces in 1956, the community development movement now covers 55 provinces. Self-help projects undertaken by the people in the past four years number 29,886 valued at P29 million. These projects included food production, varied barrio improvements, feeder, roads, barrio waterworks and spring development, repair of schools, communal irrigation, promotion of public health, and related improvements.\r\nI urge that we give permanence to the community development program by giving the PACD the necessary power and appropriation to carry on with its task even more effectively.\r\nOur war veterans, war widows and orphans deserved our continuing concern. For the simplification of the administration of veterans\u2019 claim and benefits, we have consolidated all agencies in the Philippine Veterans Administration. It is expected that under the new dispensation the interest of the defenders of our country will be fully attended to including those related to their claims with U.S. government.\r\nThe devastating floods in many areas in 1960 emphasized the need for revising our policies on reforestation and river basin resources development.\r\nLast Year I stressed the importance of development plans to utilize to the maximum the potentials of our river basin resources. This is necessary, whether it be for power generation, for the irrigation of farm lands or for industry and home use , but particularly to arrest the recurrent ravages of floods.\r\nI therefore urge that Congress adopt measures for the reorientation of public works with a view to combining the objectives of flood control, water conservation, industrial power generation into integrated multi-purpose projects.\r\nThe enforcement of the new Civil Service Law, including fair and necessary salary adjustments, has improved the morale of civil servants and developed a greater sense of responsibility in the public service. The constitutional injunction that appointments in the civil service shall be based on merit has been strengthened.\r\nI reiterate the recommendation in my message of last year that the new Civil Service Act be improved by eliminating certain provisions apparently inconsistent with the Constitution and also other provisions which are vague, uncertain or incompatible with each other.\r\nRecognizing the need for upgrading the quality of public administration, executive and supervisory development seminars have been conducted. The beneficial effects of these programs have become evident in the increased efficiency of the various arms of the public service. The increasing appreciation for progressive management was climaxed recently by our sponsorship of the first general assembly of the Eastern Regional Organization on Public Administration.\r\nThe government corporations continue to be worthy instruments of the government for industrial pioneering.\r\nIn pursuance of the policy of placing in the hands of private enterprise those corporations that have accomplished their pioneering role, I approved the sale of the Naga Cement Plant located in Naga, Cebu. In 1957 we sold the Bacnotan Cement Plant. The sale of the Maria Cristina Fertilizer Plant for P12 million has also been effected. The Cabinet has already approved the sale of the Insular Sugar Refinery at more than P6 million and is considering the liquidation of two textile mills of the National Development Company. The process will continue until ultimately the government is completely out of business.\r\nThe Joint Legislative-Executive Tax Commission, created to improve our tax system, has already submitted legislative plans which deserve your serious consideration. These proposals meet the need for additional revenue, without increasing the average taxpayers\u2019 burden, and provide impetus for rapid economic development.\r\nI am prepared to endorse any measure aimed at revising the Tariff and Custom Code, in harmony with the condition that obtain under the decontrol program and external trade. I also urge necessary revisions in the National Internal Revenue Code. Among the changes should be a scheme for the automatic retention of the share of the local governments in the national taxes concomitant with the policy of giving them greater economy.\r\nOur courts of justice have maintained in momentum in reducing delay in the disposition of judicial cases. With the increased jurisdiction granted in 1960 to municipal courts in chartered cities and justice of the peace courts, our higher courts have been relieved of the burden of petty litigations.\r\nThey were thus able to devote more time and effort to more important cases.\r\nThe Court of Industrial Relations and the Court of Agrarian Relations have done commendable work in settling controversies between labor and management, and between landowners and tenants. There is now industrial and agrarian peace. The Court of Tax Appeals has sped up decision on assessments made by the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\r\nOur Armed Forces continue to play a vital role not only in the preservation of peace and order but also in our socio-economic activities. They helped beyond the call of duty in school building construction, in relief work during times of public calamities, even in land resettlement and rural development.\r\nThere has been a marked decrease in the personnel strength of the Armed Forces since 1953 without impairing its capability to maintain peace and order, carry on with military training and fulfill our international commitments. It is our constant endeavor to keep our National Defense organization abreast with the latest advances. Under the Mutual Defense Pat with the United States we are modernizing our armed forces particularlt in relation to the new weapons and methods of warfare.\r\nBecause of our independent foreign policy, we have gained new prestige in our own region of the world and in the international community. We are truly forging the true image of the Filipino nation. With rational firmness, we have accomplished much without painful disruptions or violent difficulties which normally follow the process.\r\nThe bonds of friendship and mutual interest which link the Philippines and the United States, our closet ally and friend, remain firm and enduring. This was remarkably dramatized by the visit here of President Eisenhower last year. On the questions of disarmament, cessation of nuclear tests, the peaceful uses of atomic energy, mutual security, regional defense and respect for the dignity of the human person, the Philippines stands with the free peoples of the world in unity of purpose.\r\nBut relations, however, cordial, cannot be entirely free from difficulties. It is to the credit of the Philippines and America, for instance, that wherever such difficulties have arisen, sincere efforts have been exerted to overcome them with fairness and justice.\r\nIt is in this spirit that I am happy to report to you that, in addition to the major agreements reached last year in the negotiations conducted between our Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador of the United States, considerable progress has been achieved more recently on the highly sensitive question of criminal jurisdiction in relation to U.S. bases in the Philippines. I am confident that the remaining unsettled questions in the revision of the Military Bases Agreement will be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties during the war.\r\nProgress has also been made in the current negotiation for the adjustment of the principal obligation and interest under the Romulo-Snyder Agreement. You are aware of the two separate bills under consideration in the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Congress for the payment of the balance of our war damage claims. The hope that the United States Congress will finally act on those pending measures is quite bright. Furthermore, we will exert our utmost in the American Congress to make permanent the increase of our sugar quota by 500,000 tons now granted us on a temporary basis.\r\nIn the World Organization, we continued to support the stabilizing \u201cpresence\u201d of the United Nations in troubled spots of the world, such as in Laos and the Congo. We strongly co-sponsored the declaration against the continuance of colonialism in all its form anywhere in the world.\r\nOur policy of closer ties with Asia has also gained fresh momentum. We have accredited a diplomatic mission to Ceylon. We have just authorized a legation in Laos. We concluded with the Government of Indonesia an agreement for joint naval patrol of southern water. We have begun negotiation of a trade agreement with South Korea and will soon meet with Pakistan for the same purpose. We are considering cultural accords with the Republic of China, Pakistan and the United Arab Republic. We have entered into an agreement for the mutual abolition of visa fees with South Korea and Israel. We are also at the stage of concluding a postal agreement with Japan.\r\nAt the gracious invitation of President Chiang kai Shek, I paid a most fruitful and rewarding visit to Taiwan during which we renewed the cordial ties that bind our two countries. I shall visit the Federation of Malaya next month.\r\nOur panel of negotiations has also just signed the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation with their Japanese counterparts. Considering the importance of the Treaty and its effect upon the general economy of our nation, it is my desire that the Treaty be subjected to a thorough scrutiny and exhaustive consideration by as many conceivable segments of our population as possible before it goes through the constitutional process for ratification. I express the fervent hope that the discussion of the Treaty shall be dispassionate and objective with an eye single to the best interest of the nation.\r\nRecent developments and the perceivable trend of possibilities indicate that the problem which Communist China poses to the security of our area might assume a new proportion. It will do us well to asses carefully those possibilities with a view to determining their impact upon our policy towards Communist China and what measures we could devise alone or in cooperation with the free peoples or our region to meet the developing situation.\r\nIn the matter of procurement and disposition of reparations goods and services from Japan our country, as of November 30, 1960, has received a total of P198.3 million in machineries and equipment for public works, capital goods for government agencies and private entities, and services in the salvage of sunken vessels that clog our sea lanes.\r\nThe value of goods and services already contracted by our government, however, is P246 million and the Japanese Government has already paid to Japanese supplies the sum of P227.9 million. Therefore, based on the P225 million due from the Japanese Government during the first four and a half years of the Agreement, Japan has fully met her commitments to the Philippines.\r\nThe annual schedule of payments and allocations to the public and private sector is with a view of utilizing reparations payments in such a manner as shall assure the maximum benefits in an equitable and widespread a manner as possible. We set aside P5 million o develop the potential cottage and home industries and thereby provide more employment opportunities for the masses. This policy will be implemented annually as long as necessary. Furthermore, we are now seeing to it that only industrial projects which satisfy a system of industrial priorities should be allowed for procurement.\r\nEffort is being exerted to make full use of the P250 million investment loan by lightening the terms and conditions under which this may be extended.\r\nWith a view of obtaining maximum benefits from reparations payments, the Reparations Law should be amended along lines already indicated in my last message.\r\nThe Filipino youth fired with ardent patriotism and raring to do something for their beloved fatherland should be rallied and organized for civic service. They can be immense help in solving the worsening youth delinquency problem. They are a definite asset in fighting Communism. They can be massive assistance, as once in the past, in keeping elections free, honest, and orderly. They can contributed effectively in our efforts for reforestation and against deforestation and also in the conservation of other natural resources. They can wield a tremendous influence for good in moral regeneration and in many other undertakings requiring mass action.\r\nIt is therefore recommended that legislation in this direction backed up by adequate financing be adopted.\r\nAt any start of my Administration and again in my 1960 message on the State of the Nation, I pledged total war against graft and corruption in the public service although it is a matter of history that this problem was inherited from a previous regime. I mean to keep my pledge no matter at what cost. The campaign gained added vigor with the implementation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The Presidential Anti-Graft Committee has since been probing cases of unexplained wealth.\r\nVarious executive departments have initiated administrative cases numbering 21,992; 13,600 cases were decided with 9,547convictions and 4,110 exonerations. Some 8335 case are pending decision. Criminal cases totaling 740 were filed. I can state with pride and certainty that this record is unprecedented in the annals of all previous administrations. Contrary to gratuitous allegations, I can say, and he record will bear me out, that we have taken action against all accused malefactors in the public service irrespective of whether they are \u201cbig fishes or small fries.\u201d I wish to reiterate anew that we cannot move in the dark. We can proceed only against those cases brought to light by civic-minded citizens and supported by evidence. We cannot act on the basis of generalities or on gossips peddled by \u201cugly wagging tongues.\u201d\r\nI have urged all sectors of the Government as well as the public in general to help in the campaign by supplying us facts and proofs. Graft and corruption is a social problem which cannot be eradicated by mere lip service or mere wishful thinking or condemnatory language in some \u201ccorners.\u201d\r\nIn this connection the teaching of moral values should be further strengthened through the intensification of Character Education as a separate subject in the curricula of all public and private schools. I consider this emphasis of great value in our campaign against graft and corruption since it will imbue our school children with the concepts of honesty and righteousness at a time when their minds are still impressionable.\r\nLet it sink into the conscience of society that it takes at least two or commit graft and corruption. The bribe giver is as guilty, if not more so, than the bribe taker. It is unfortunate, however that society only condemns the briber taker and even idolizes the wealthy tempter. It is another ironic misfortune that the administration which does the dirty job of flushing out, identifying, exposing and punishing without fear or favor corruption in government, gets as its reward the reputation of being corrupt. If society does not correct this twisted attitude, the day will come when this social cancer will spread deep into the system of our body politics without any doctor that will have the courage to prescribe the remedy and lead the nation to salvation.\r\nI therefore call upon the press, the radio and television to focus their floodlights upon the men who committed the corrupt act and not upon the administration that caught and punished the act. Let us not hide the identity of the corrupt behind generalities. Let us demand that the corrupt men answer for their criminal acts instead of pinning responsibility on President under that novel political heresy of \u201ccommand responsibility.\u201d\r\nLadies and Gentlemen of the Congress, I have formulated for your consideration eighteen (18) important recommendations in the course of this message. But before I conclude permit me to tax your indulgence by proposing other recommendations of no less importance and urgency in abbreviated form as follows:\r\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the broad front of basic governmental reforms. I reiterate all the recommendations I have made for appropriate all amendments to the Constitution in my last message.\r\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To accelerate our industrialization and the utilization of our vast natural resources, I recommend amendments to the petroleum, mining and corporation acts to make them conform with modern advances, problems and trends in leading mining countries;\r\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I recommend amendment of the tax exemption law to exempt specified basic industries from the payment of duties and taxes fixed capital requirement;\r\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I ask you to study the proper utilization of the proceeds from the margin levy to encourage maximum development of priority industries and push through more vigorously important public works to high economic value;\r\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The NASSCO charter has to be amended to permit the participation of the private sector in the corporation\u2019s integrated steel project;\r\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We must extend tariff protection to infant agricultural industries, such as coffee, cacao, citrus, peanuts, and others.\r\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For improved fiscal administration, I recommend the following measures:\r\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suspension of the tax on capital gains provided such gains are plowed back to investment in industry;\r\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extension of a preferential rate of income taxes to dividend earned on shares of stock;\r\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision be made for carry-over losses;\r\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further modernization of the tax system by doing away with regressive taxes and by devising a more equitable distribution of the tax burden based on capacity to pay;\r\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change the allotment base on internal revenue taxes and to effect the automatic retention of shares of local governments. And\r\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of a uniform and at the same time flexible and updatable real property assessment system.\r\nIn this connection I want to interject the observation that land values in and around industrial centers have increased even fifty times as high as, say, a decade ago, and yet their assessment values have remained stationary. Another observation is that when the government buys a real property for some public use, it pays a price ten or twenty times more than the assessed value. There should be a limit of the proportion between the assessed value and the expropriation value so that land assessment should not be brought down too low.\r\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Congressional appropriation of funds to complete the Rizal Centennial Shrine. Unhappy, private contributions for the purpose have run short of the total requirement, and we certainly owe it to the memory of our national hero to come to the rescue of this project and see it through to completion this year.\r\nGentlemen, in my humble way I have outline the legislative task of the year. I have set he goals we should attain, and I have profound faith that we shall attain them with the united determination of Congress. But man is finite and God is infinite and eternal and so we need Him in all our national efforts. Let us therefore pray for His guidance and mercy and that He abide with us forever and fill our days with the abundance of His blessings.\r\n\u201cFor His Kingdom is a Kingdom of all ages, and dominion endureth throughout all generations. They shall publish the memory of the abundance of His sweetness and shall rejoice in His Justice.\u201d (Psalm 144)\r\nWith Him nothing is impossible; without Him nothing. I thank you.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1963-01-28 14:05:45+00:00", "author": "Diosdado Macapagal", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 28, 1963]\r\nOne year ago we stood on this same platform to announce before the Nation the tasks that we pledged ourselves to perform. We stand here again today to render an accounting to the Congress and to the people of what has been done to accomplish these tasks, where the country now stands and what next is to be done to build the economic and social progress that has become the urgent right of all our people.\r\nThe past year has been a crucial one. We began our labor for the people under extremely adverse conditions. The gov\u00adernment was bankrupt; it was operating on a deficit of P250 million. The international reserves were\r\nwith the dollar reserves at $103 million and the Central Bank obligated in the sum of $341 million at preferred rates ranging from P2.00 to P3.20 per $1.00. Graft and corruption had seeped into every nook and crevice of the government, both national and local. The people had assumed an attitude of cynicism, an attitude that made them shrug off corruption as inevitable. While population was increasing at the rate of 3.2 per cent annually, the rate of economic growth had decreased from 7.8 per cent in 1955 to an annual average of only 4.4 percent each year thereafter until and including 1961, and symptomatic of the economic deterioration, prices were steadily rising to exorbitant heights without hope of abatement.\r\nIt was in this depressing setting that we undertook the difficult task of straightening out the national shambles and building the structure of a better future for our people.\r\nWe committed ourselves to the solution of two major problems facing the country. One was the need for moral regeneration and the other, the need for a faster rate of economic growth. We shall in this report recount what has been done toward the accomplishment of these tasks.\r\nBefore doing so, however, we beg your indulgence to express with candor some thoughts on relevant matters that have aroused the public interest. Among these has been the concern expressed for the two-party system because of our alleged desire to control both Houses of Congress by accepting leaders and members of the Opposition into the Administration.\r\nWe reject the imputation that we seek the control of Congress. Having been in Congress ourself, we do not think any one can control Congress by making it do what it cannot be intelligently persuaded to do voluntarily. What we seek is the constitutional cooperation of Congress\u2014that is to say, the cooperation that the Congress and the President owe to each other in the interest of the people in accordance with the party system of government which we have adopted in our Republic. That constitutional cooperation is best attained\u2014and we submit that this was the intent of the Constitution\u2014when Congress and the President pertain to the same political party. It is only this situation that makes possible party responsibility without which the two-party system is a farce. It was this situation under which all our predecessors had worked since the founding of the Republic. This would not mean placing Congress in the control of the Executive because, as it happened in 1951-53, the fact that the political party of the President had a majority in both Houses of Congress did not necessarily mean that the President had the cooperation, much less the control, of Congress. We submit that given the pitfalls of rabid partisanship, it is desirable for our democ\u00adracy that the Congress and the President should pertain to the same party. This situation whereby the Congress and the Executive pertain to the same party should in the normal course be brought about in an election. However, if through an imperfect operation of the democratic mechanism which we strive continually to improve, this desirable situation does not result from an election, it is neither against democracy nor against the national interest to endeavor to bring about the situation through the inherent freedom or some other legitimate measures allowed in a democracy.\r\nIt was against the background of this political philosophy that in the course of the past year, many leaders of the people who enjoy the faith, confidence and support of their constituents, some of them being members of this Congress, have placed the interest of the people above their partisan in\u00adterest and have joined cause with the Administration in the her\u00adculean endeavor to promote a rapid rate of progress for our people. Their action is not to be gauged in terms of those drifting ways of the past but in the light of the urgency of courageous and decisive action called for by the national am\u00adbition for monumental progress in the inspired present. We know that these leaders have taken these steps primarily be\u00adcause of their conviction that the socio-economic blueprint that we are energetically carrying out in order to bring about rapidly the prosperity of our people is the right course for the Nation. We hereby make it of record, as the highest spokes\u00adman of our people and in their name, for the judgment of our posterity that in our view, these leaders who have joined us in our endeavor have performed less of an act of partisan in\u00adfidelity and more of an act of patriotism which our people approve of and accept with appreciation and gratitude.\r\nThe other matter to which we beg leave to refer in candor has been the anxiety shown for the Constitution and civil liber\u00adties because of alleged dictatorial, impatient and vindictive tendencies on our part. This concern is without basis in fact.\r\nPermit me to state that we are too much of a lawyer to disregard the Constitution and the law. Our seeming im\u00adpatience is over unduly prolonged argumentation about the law because we believe that whenever there is legal controversy, which is unavoidable among lawyers, the best step in the public interest is to elevate the controversy to the Supreme Court, in the meantime go about our tasks, accept the decision of the Supreme Court when it is handed down, and then proceed in our ways of serving the people along the lines indicated by the Supreme Court decision. It has been our invariable attitude that irrespective of our personal views, we shall abide by and implement the decisions of the Supreme Court. As long as the President of the Republic abides by the decisions of the Su\u00adpreme Court, there can be and there will be no dictatorship in this country. Like all Filipinos, we are lovers of freedom and we are against dictatorship in our country, and whether now or in the future, we are with those who will fight the establish\u00adment of a dictatorship in our land.\r\nIn truth, our seeming impatience over fruitless wrangling is but a reflection of the impatience of our people to be given the chance to enjoy the good life to which they are entitled. Legal issues must be debated. But while we debate, the people feel the pangs of hunger and demand that their problems be solved before it is too late.\r\nIndeed, we confess to one impatience\u2014to the impatience which we believe to be the impatience of our people that measures be taken immediately to enable our impoverished people quickly to have a better life. To us, this is more than impatience; it is a passion. We cannot help feeling and thinking otherwise because we have personally known the pain of hunger and poverty.\r\nBecause of our actions which are reflective of the impatience and hunger of our people for a better life, it is possible that we may have hurt and offended others. We ask their forbearance. It is not our wish to hurt or prejudice anyone if we could avoid it. We bear no resentment against anybody. If it were possible, we wish all to be our friends. To say that we are vindictive is to trample upon the truth. There is abso\u00adlutely no touch of vindictiveness in our being. The truth is, we have a task to pave the way for the improvement of the livelihood of our people within the span of our mandate and we intend to do this task in the best and most effective manner within the sanction of the Constitution and the law. We are resolved not to fail in this undertaking of achieving economic progress during our tenure. It is around this resolve that all our decisions and actions revolve. Accordingly, those who will help us we shall clasp as friends, irrespective of relations in the past; and similarly, those who will seek to frustrate us we shall be constrained to resist vigorously, likewise irrespective of events in the past. We deny the offense of vindictiveness, dictatorial tendency, disregard of law, and other imaginary offenses leveled against us. We confess only to one offense, if it be an offense, which is that we love our country and people dearly. Since we have only this opportunity of a life\u00adtime to help our people attain a better life, we are grimly resolved to sacrifice friendships and everything and even our own self, our own comfort, security and happiness, for the dedicated pursuit of bringing about the prosperity and hap\u00adpiness of our people in the quickest possible time.\r\nPartisan conflict is perhaps unavoidable in a democracy like ours which is operated on the party system. At the beginning of our labor, we had wanted to avoid participation in partisan strife. Without now dwelling on the responsibility for the change, we have been lately constrained to take part in partisan activity within proper bounds in the conviction that without an increased political preponderance in our favor, we face frustration in the task of bringing about a sufficient degree of economic and social progress for our people during the period of our trust. If partisan contention is inevitable in a representative government, we fervently hope that it can be minimized for the sake of the public welfare. We ardently wish that more and more of us who are representing and leading our people will more and more recognize the occasions and matters where partisan attitude must end because there the national interest which requires united action begins. It is our fervent longing that one such matter and occasion that should be regarded as meriting united national action is the successful implementation of our socio-economic development program because of our conviction that it is only through the resultant general pros\u00adperity that our masses can share the boon of a good life. It is our prayer that in things required for the success of the program, partisan strife can be avoided. Indeed, on our part, we have participated in partisan activity only as inevitably required by the need to insure the success of the Nation\u2019s socio-economic development program.\r\nWe shall now dwell on our twin tasks of moral regeneration and a faster rate of economic growth. In undertaking a moral regeneration drive, we adopted a constructive and forward-looking outlook and policy. We have resorted more to con\u00adstructive, preventive and remedial measures for moral renais\u00adsance than to punitive actions.\r\nIn accordance with a constructive anti-graft policy, we undertook a series of measures to eliminate the sources of cor\u00adruption in the Executive Branch of the government which is our prime field of responsibility. We abolished the system of foreign exchange controls, aware that this had become a festering source of venalities. We made appointments to im\u00adportant positions on the primordial basis of integrity and honesty. We conducted searching investigations of government irregularities. We dismissed public officials for dishonesty, dereliction of duty, official irresponsibility, and grave abuse of authority and other similar violations of the code of upright public service. We have not spared even the closest friends\u2014people whom we have long known and who had done much for us\u2014because we believe that our duty is not to serve friends but to serve the people. We issued an executive order pro\u00adhibiting government officials from having official transactions with any of the President\u2019s immediate relatives. The members of our official family made public their assets and liabilities although this is not required by law.\r\nWe took positive steps to re-establish the moral identity of the Filipino. Our people are inherently a race of honest men and women. With a view to enhancing these qualities, we took official cognizance of acts of honesty, respect for the law, simple living, punctuality, courtesy, cleanliness, de\u00advotion to the people in public trust, frugality, discouragement of gifts, discontinuance of large official retinues, patronage of native materials, and the like. We honored humble citizens who performed deeds of honesty. We conferred a Presidential Citation upon officials and individuals who have demonstrated adherence to the creed of honesty and integrity. Realizing the tremendous persuasive powers of the Presidency, we and our family have striven to set personal examples in honesty, simplicity and dedication.\r\nIn view of the number of wrongs deliberately or carelessly committed in the past, for the full investigation and prose\u00adcution of which there would be no material time, we have limited punitive actions to a degree sufficient to deter similar wrongs in the future. Mainly, these cases consisted of those concerning the top offenders in certain categories of venalities, committed by Filipinos and aliens, which should be discouraged and eradicated as roadblocks to the progress of the country. We hope that the constructive and remedial results from these exemplary cases would be sufficient and would not constrain us to expand action in our determination to effect moral recon\u00adstruction as a prerequisite to national progress.\r\nThe categories of venalities on which we took action against the top offenders were the following: (1) aliens who organized networks of corruption to advance their business interests; (2) former aliens who, although not weaving elaborate webs of corruption, were engaged in venalities to promote their a business interest; (3) aliens who engaged in profiteering activities; (4) aliens who evaded the payment of taxes; and (5) aliens who, contrary to law, participated actively in par\u00adtisan politics.\r\nAmong the nationals, we took action on the following persons: (1) those who utilized organized political power to build business empires, and vice-versa; (2) those who mis\u00adused public trust to amass wealth; (3) those who evaded the payment of taxes; (4) those who perpetrated smuggling; (5) those who committed copra overpricing; and (6) those unscru\u00adpulous labor leaders who have exploited their followers for selfish purposes.\r\nIn connection with the action taken against aliens who corrupted public officials, we have so far relieved fifteen high officials, accepted the resignation of one of our cabinet members and reassigned another cabinet member to another post. In acting on other irregularities, likewise relieved the presi\u00addent of the government commercial bank and the chairman of its board of directors who were our own appointees.\r\nIn this moral drive to which the Administration has de\u00addicated itself, the innocent need not fear, for they will not be molested. The well-to-do need not feel apprehension, for the drive is aimed not at them but at the unscrupulous oper\u00adators who, using unfair and illegal means, have amassed ill-gotten wealth to the detriment of the general welfare. In point of fact, our goal is to create conditions of fair and equal opportunity wherein the maximum number of our people may become prosperous and wealthy through honest toil. The busi\u00adnessmen need not have anxieties, for the drive is not against businessmen but against powerful politicians who have used their political office and influence to dominate vital business ventures and compete with bona fide businessmen. Even the guilty will be given every opportunity to present and defend their case.\r\nTo those who promote their interest through hard work and integrity, we shall give the protective shield of the Ad\u00administration and provide them with all the opportunities to advance further. But the law can be justly merciless, too, in its retribution on those who believe that they are above the law. We will be fair even to those who will be unfair to us, but we will act resolutely against those who betray the trust of the people. We believe that it is in this way that true democracy, which is the system which our people have cherished, will nourish in our country.\r\nThe results of our moral drive have been gratifying. The \u201ctong\u201d system in which businessmen made regular pay\u00adments to government officials has ended. The practices of pay\u00ading commission, percentage, overprice or kick-back in consideration of contracts and public service has been curbed. The webs of corruption which unscrupulous individuals had woven in our society through many years of unrestrained activity have been destroyed. The commission of graft at the higher echelons has been virtually terminated; at the lowest levels of government, it has been substantially minimized. We will relentlessly go after venalities at all levels of the public service.\r\nWe shall now dwell on the most vital endeavor of our generation\u2014the propulsion and maintenance of a faster rate of economic growth that can provide the needs of our multi\u00adplying population. In facing our awesome responsibility when we took over the Administration, it was obvious to us that after eliminating the stench of moral decay in the Govern\u00adment and in our society, the main task was to rescue the economy from the suffocation that choked it to paralyzation, loosen and remove the manacles that impeded its movement, infuse it with vigor and guide it forward. All our multifarious problems spring from the lack of financial sustenance arising from an anemic and unproductive economy. While the Nation has been undergoing a population explosion, the food on the Nation\u2019s table available for distribution for the people\u2019s needs have been too scanty to provide adequately for ail the sectors who are entitled to the essential services of the State. The Government could not repeat the miracle of feeding five thou\u00adsand with five loaves of bread and two fishes. The obvious and indispensable solution to our country\u2019s myriad problems was to develop as rapidly as possible our natural resources in order to increase the food on the Nation\u2019s table, thereby enabling more of our people to partake of the wealth that God has bestowed for the use not of a few but of all.\r\nIt was to meet frontally this grave problem that we insti\u00adtuted decontrol and launched the Nation\u2019s integrated five-year socio-economic development program in our first State-of-the-Nation Message to this Congress on January 22, 1962. It will be recalled that the House of Representatives adopted this Program. While the Senate, avowedly for lack of time, did not act on the program, the National Security Council, in which the Senate is represented, has officially adopted the same. The Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Development Program, therefore, has become the Nation\u2019s Program. It is your program, as much as it is our own. It is our People\u2019s program. We cited in that program, a three-fold objective, namely:\r\nFirst, the immediate restoration of economic stability;\r\nSecond, the alleviation of the plight of the common man; and\r\nThird, the establishment of a dynamic basis for future growth\r\nLet me review with you what has been done in relation to these three major goals.\r\nOur first act upon assuming office was to dispel the at\u00admosphere of uncertainty that pervaded the business commu\u00adnity and discouraged the steady expansion of the country\u2019s productive ventures. On January 21, 1962, as a fundamental and necessary step for stabilizing business conditions and for setting a more rational basis for business plans, we lifted foreign exchange controls. These accomplished two desirable effects: it allowed the exchange rate to be determined by the forces of the free market; and it removed from public au\u00adthorities the power of allocation and control over foreign ex\u00adchange funds. The only exceptions were the required sale of twenty per cent of export proceeds to the Central Bank and the settlement of contractual obligations at rates previously agreed upon.\r\nAfter an anxious supervision of the currency reform, we are now able to declare that the decontrol program has worked out extremely well, with a minimum of adverse repercussions. Fourteen weeks after decontrol was proclaimed, the exchange rate began to stabilize at levels reflective of the real external value of the peso. Since May, the selling rate of commercial banks has kept within the range of P3.87 to P3.92 per U.S. dollar. A new stabilizing factor has emerged with the sub\u00adstantial increases in forward exchange transactions during the last twelve months from $0.26 million in February to $50.41 million in November.\r\nThe favorable effects of decontrol have registered them\u00adselves conspicuously. Our export receipts increased by $103 mil\u00adlion over the previous year, while our import bill decreased by $72 million. In contrast to a trade deficit of $144 million in 1961, our external trade accounts showed a surplus of $31 million last year. Our international reserves grew from a level of $103 million at the beginning of the year to $140 million at the end, in spite of the large amount of foreign repayments and of our long term and preferred foreign com\u00admitments from $341 million to $137 million. Operating receipts of the national government increased by P290 million over those of the past year. The total paid-up capital on new corporate investments rose from P100.6 million in 1961 to P110.3 million in 1962, reflecting an increase of 9.6 per cent. Agricultural production increased by 6.5 per cent in palay alone, and 7.1 per cent for all food crops. Industrial production for the first six months increased by 7.3 per cent.\r\nThe year also brought in external developments which will provide us with more resources for future development. The first was the passage by the United States Congress of the War Damage Act, providing for $73 million, which would bolster our balance of payments position. The second was the decision of foreign aid agencies to integrate their aid programs with our own socio-economic program.\r\nThe effect of decontrol on prices was moderate and far less disturbing than what was originally anticipated. In this connection, may we be permitted to correct once and for all the misrepresentation that during the presidential campaign we pledge to lower prices. We did not make any such com\u00admitment. We could not have made such pledge considering our platform for decontrol. Anyone who persists in claiming that we made this pledge is deliberately, maliciously, and ir\u00adresponsibly misleading the people.\r\nOur pledge during the campaign was not to lower the prices but to stop rising prices, which are two different things. This is evidenced by our posters and radio jingles all over the country which cried; \u201cStop corruption! Stop rising prices!\u201d There was only one commodity the price of which we pledged to lower\u2014and that was rice, the staple food of our people. We have fulfilled this specific pledge and consider\u00ading that rice is the prime food of our people, we will continue to do everything that is in our power to insure that rice is made available at lower prices at all times within the reach of the masses of our people.\r\nAlthough it was not our pledge to lower the prices of commodities but to stop their inordinate rise, the objectives of our socio-economic development program once attained will in truth result in the equivalent of lower prices. As the real incomes of our people rise due to increasing production and greater employment, our people will be able to buy more goods because of larger incomes, even though prices may be somewhat higher in peso terms.\r\nPending the arrival of that stage in our socio-economic development program when income levels will be much higher\u2014 and purchasing power correspondingly greater\u2014what is the present situation on prices? Although prices all over the world have been rising, the rise of prices in the Philippines has been so moderate that, according to a world survey made by the Associated Press in November, 1962, prices in the Phil\u00adippines are second to the lowest in the world. According to this survey, the lowest prices are in the Netherlands, second in the Philippines and third in Egypt and the highest prices are in France, second in Italy and third in the United States. During the past year, the consumer price index increased by 6.7 per cent in Manila and by 4.3 per cent outside Manila. In comparison, after currency reforms in other countries similar to our decontrol, prices increased by 12 per cent in Mexico, 15 per cent in Thailand, 30 per cent in Indonesia, and 102 per cent in Argentina.\r\nThis is the important fact; that price levels have been stabilized and real incomes are rising through the increase in production and job opportunities brought about, by our socio-economic development program and the Emergency Em\u00adployment Administration, Opposition leaders are authority for the thesis that it does not matter if prices in peso terms are rising, as long as the real incomes of the people are also rising. That is exactly what has been done and what will continue to be done: increase jobs and incomes. The incomes of the government personnel, including the armed forces, have been increased. The total increased wages in the public sector amounted to P93 million. Increase of wages in private enter\u00adprises has also been correspondingly taking place. The incomes of the producers, farmers and exporters have been increasing because of the higher peso value of their produce and exports as a result of decontrol. The income of coconut producers alone has increased by P145 million.\r\nOne difference between the recent past and the present may be stated to be that in the past, prices continued to rise exorbitantly without hope of relief for the people. At the present time, the people have been assured of rice and corn at lower prices; the prices of other prime commodities have been stabilized; and there is not only hope but legitimate ex\u00adpectation that with the passage of time the quantity of goods and services will so increase and incomes will so rise that prices will be well within the reach of our people.\r\nThe achievement of relative price stability was due in large measure to the increase in domestic production and to the operations of the Rice and Corn Administration and the NAMARCO. A major stabilizing factor was the observ\u00adance of monetary and fiscal prudence on the part of the Ad\u00administration as a precautionary measure incident to decontrol in order to forestall speculation, to keep the exchange rate in rein, and to cushion the excessive monetary expansion per\u00adpetrated in 1961.\r\nAs an initial step incident to decontrol, credit was tightened by the Central Bank, but credit restrictions were relaxed from the second quarter on. The liberalization of credit was made permissible by the stability of the exchange rate and the exercise of fiscal responsibility. If complaints of money tight\u00adness continued to be raised, the reason was largely statutory rather than regulatory for the lending capacity of several banks had hit the limit imposed by law on the ratio of their net worth to their risk assets. In order to expand credit in the scope that will be helpful and non-inflationary, legis\u00adlation is necessary, as will hereafter be proposed.\r\nFiscal discipline was achieved by keeping government spend\u00ading from unduly expanding and by increasing revenue collec\u00adtions. The broadening of the tax base as a consequence of the change of value of the peso and the intensification of customs and internal revenue collections improved the fiscal position of the Government. The result was the generation of a cash surplus of P159 million during the second half of FY 1962 to offset partially the cash deficit of P246 million incurred during the first half under the previous administration. Thus, the over-all cash deficit incurred in the first six months of the fiscal year was reduced by P87 million, after repaying the obligation incurred by the past administration to the Central Bank in the sum of P100 million. During the first calendar year of our Administration, we achieved a cash surplus of P16 million as compared to a deficit of P215 million in the corresponding period of 1961.\r\nThe use of monetary and fiscal instruments for the preser\u00advation of stability after decontrol was complemented by a set of specific commercial policies to protect and encourage local industries. As a result of investigations made by the Tariff Commission and the National Economic Council, we revised the tariff schedules in January and June last year and again in January, this year to accord more protection to do\u00admestic producers of essential commodities, particularly textiles. These modifications embraced over 200 domestic industries employing about 40,000 persons.\r\nWe also took positive measures through the Department of Finance to counteract the dumping of certain subsidized foreign products such as black iron, galvanized iron pipes, and truck tires and tubes. Had these not been imposed, some of the moat essential industries operating in the Philippines would have been adversely affected.\r\nThe foregoing steps taken were, among the many efforts undertaken, in cognizance of the temporary disruptions which inevitably accompany a major shift in the fundamental pattern of our economy. The removal of artificial market structures, the elimination of windfall exchange profits, the placing of entrepreneurs on a free competitive basis\u2014all these had to be achieved in the soonest possible time with the least possible dislocation.\r\nIt is desirable to effect full decontrol by providing a substi\u00adtute for the 20 per cent retention of dollar export receipts by the Central Bank. Such step will pave the way of the early establishment of a fixed par value for the peso which will provide greater incentives to exports, facilitate long-range plan\u00adning and greater inflow of foreign investment. A substitute measure would yield more revenues to the Government than the 20 per cent retention scheme the proceeds of which do not entirely accrue to the National Government but merely places the Central Bank in a position to support the Government expenditure program in an amount equivalent to the peso rights accruing to the Bank from the 20 per cent requirement.\r\nThe substitute source of revenue should not fall indiscrimi\u00adnately on all exports because this would go against one of the objectives of decontrol which is to stimulate the develop\u00adment of new and specially processed and manufactured export goods. The impost should bear mostly on exported raw ma\u00adterials and should exclude manufactured goods. An untaxed raw material export is a burden on domestic processors, who have to pay domestic sales taxes and a subsidy to foreign labor and capital, thus fomenting unfair competition against our processed exports.\r\nThe Administration has unequivocally committed itself to the mission of alleviating the plight of the common man. It is explicitly one of the major goals of the Socio-Economic Program that the less fortunate masses are provided a larger and increasing portion of the Nation\u2019s economic and social benefits, and that the transition to a free market is done as helpfully as possible to the common people.\r\nToward this end, we have implemented various measures primarily designed to make available the basic economic neces\u00adsities of food, shelter and clothing to the masses at prices they can afford.\r\nOne of the major problems which we have sought to elimi\u00adnate has been the recurring shortages in our staple foods. Since the enactment of Republic Act No. 3452 creating the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) last June, we are pleased to state that the rice crisis, which had been persistently plaguing our economy and which necessitated the importations of rice, particularly in 1961, is now an event of the past. To be more specific, in 1961 it cost our people P60 million in rice importa\u00adtion without solving the problem; in 1962, without importation, it cost the RCA only P1.5 million while paying Pll.50 per cavan of 45 kilos of palay to the rice growers and distributing rice at P0.85 to P0.95 per ganta to the consumers.\r\nAs a result of its operations, the RCA has been able to accomplish, with exceptional success, the primary objective of not only stabilizing the price of rice and corn, but also providing the necessary incentives to our farmers to produce more of these staple foods by offering them a fair and just return for their produce. Since the last harvest, the RCA has embarked on massive palay procurement operations. It is now operating about 150 warehouses throughout the country with an aggregate capacity of six million cavans of palay. In addition, the RCA operates over one hundred mills capable of processing 10,000 cavans of rice daily.\r\nThe National Economic Council has estimated a surplus of over eight million sacks of palay by the end of the current crop year.\r\nIn conjunction with the operations of the RCA, the Rice and Corn Board has actively implemented the Rice and Corn Nationalization Law in accordance with the law\u2019s spirit and intention.\r\nIn the success achieved by the RCA in coping with the rice problem, acknowledgment is due not only the adminis\u00adtration leaders in Congress but likewise the opposition leaders who cooperated fully with the rice and corn program of the Administration, particularly Senate President Eulogio Rodriguez and former Speaker Daniel Romualdez.\r\nThe spectacular success that has been attained in solving the rice problem and avoiding the recurrent rice crisis, which was achieved with the help of leaders of the Opposition, is an indication of what real cooperation between the Adminis\u00adtration and the Opposition can accomplish to help our people in their difficulties. We keep on praying that in the midst of our partisan strife, the light of Divine inspiration will one day illumine our minds and hearts in order to persuade us on both sides to cast away our differences and in a mag\u00adnificent moment of national solidarity act in unison to solve successfully together the problems that are working hardships on our people.\r\nHaving coped with the problem of providing rice to our people, we moved to develop the fish industry in order to complete the components of the food of our people\u2014rice and fish. Toward this end, the Emergency Employment Adminis\u00adtration (EEA) has worked out a P15 million fishery develop\u00adment project with the Bureau of Fisheries, which is expected to increase fish production within five years by about P45 million annually. This fishery project includes, among others, the establishment of twenty stationary fishing nets in coastal provinces and fishing grounds, and the construction of sixteen fishing ports as well as refrigeration stations in strategic coastal provinces.\r\nTo cushion the increased procurement costs of imported prime commodities in 1962, we created, with the cooperation of the leaders of the Opposition, a bipartisan Technical Com\u00admittee on Prices last July for the purpose of studying and recommending measures which would best achieve the stabili\u00adzation of the prices of prime commodities at reasonable levels.\r\nIn accordance with the Committee\u2019s recommendations, the NAMARCO has been importing, since July of last year, the net national requirements for milk, sardines and corned beef, and selling them through its outlets at landed costs. As a result of this intensive program of importation by the NA\u00adMARCO, the prices of imported prime commodities have been stabilized at prices within the reach of the masses.\r\nOn the basis of the findings and recommendations, of the Secretary of Health, the Administration imported over half-a-million pesos worth of life-saving drugs. The direct im\u00adportation of life-saving drugs is a temporary measure during the period of transition which is intended mainly to provide relief to the masses who still cannot afford to pay for these prime drugs. We wish to commend our domestic drug manu\u00adfacturers for maintaining pre-decontrol price levels.\r\nThe Administration realized that certain industries in the private sector could be affected by the NAMARCO\u2019s importa\u00adtion program. Consequently, steps were taken to limit the items imported by NAMARCO and slowly shift activities to\u00adward promoting the increasing acceptance by Filipino consumers of locally-made articles. The NAMARCO has started to embark on an extensive program of procuring, distributing and merchandising locally-produced goods.\r\nMoreover, the Department of Commerce and Industry has taken steps to encourage local investors to establish whole milk factories, meat and fish canneries in order to lessen and eventually eliminate our dependence on imported prime com\u00admodities. The response of the private sector has been gratify\u00ading. By the first half of this year, we look forward to the operation of a whole milk factory, and in the near future, the establishment of fish and meat canneries which will eventually render the NAMARCO importations of prime commodities unnecessary.\r\nNext to food, steps have been taken to provide the people with adequate shelter. The administration is striving hard to rectify the deplorable housing conditions of the masses. Toward this goal, bids have recently been opened for the construction of a P3 million multi-storey tenement project in Tondo as the first phase in the Administration\u2019s massive housing program for the poor. Two other housing projects have been scheduled for construction in other Manila districts and one in Makati. The program calls for the construction of similar multi-storey tenements in urban sites in the provinces. We hope that through this program of making available decent dwellings at reasonable costs to the low-wage earners, the situation wherein the poorest of our people will be adequately housed and sheltered will become a reality in the immediate future.\r\nHaving taken steps to provide our people with food and shelter, measures were likewise undertaken to provide them with clothing. In order to make adequate clothing available to the masses, we launched, with the cooperation of the Textile Mills Association, a program for the production and distribution of a low-cost, durable cotton material known\r\nthe \u201cPag-Asa\u201d cloth which costs P0.95 a yard for men and P0.65 a yard for women, ex-factory. Through this program, we hope to fulfill the objective of the low-income people being adequately yet inexpensively clothed,\r\nThe program to provide our people with their essential need in food, shelter and clothing would be futile unless we give them an opportunity to earn the income with which to quire these needs. Our first step in this direction was to increase the income of the wage-earners. Republic Act No. 3500 which was enacted last year created a Salary Adjustment Fund amounting to P16.2 million. From this fund, we effected, an increase of at least ten pesos a month in the salaries of approximately 91,000 government employees.\r\nThe next step was immediately to provide the people with employment while awaiting the creation of job opportunities private enterprises as envisioned in the five-year socio-economic development program. To achieve our goal of pro\u00adviding maximum employment opportunities in public economic development projects, the EEA embarked last November on a nation-wide program with the immediate aim of alleviating the deplorable state of unemployment and underemployment in the country.\r\nThe bulk of the projects undertaken by the EEA are in the nature of productive public works such as the construc\u00adtion, improvement, and repair of roads and highways, find irrigation projects throughout the rural areas.\r\nMention has already been made of the EEA large-scale fishery project. In the field of handicraft industries, the EEA has recruited and trained the necessary labor for the National Cottage Industries Administration (NACIDA) according to the latter\u2019s standards and specifications.\r\nThe EEA is also actively supplementing the program of the Bureau of Agricultural Extension through the tapping of fresh agriculture graduates and their assignment to various municipalities and barrios lacking extension workers. One of the requirements for agricultural extension workers, which is an improvement of the past practice, is for them to reside in the barrios.\r\nIn coordination with the National Resettlement and Reha\u00adbilitation Administration (NARRA), the EEA has embarked on twelve projects for the clearing of land and the construction of feeder roads encompassing a total area of 20,000 hectares. Furthermore, it has undertaken intensive work in forest con\u00adservation and reforestation together with the Bureau of Forestry.\r\nIn our mission to build a better future for the common man, we did not confine ourselves to helping him acquire the food, shelter and clothing that he needs, and the income with which to obtain such needs. We proceeded to open an additional and special opportunity for his children to attain a higher success than was possible for their elders. It is in this spirit that the Administration launched the establishment of a Labor University in Makati, Rizal, which will provide the common man with the opportunity to aspire for greater achievements through the acquisition and development of the necessary skills required by our expanding economy.\r\nIn addition to opportunities to have food, shelter, clothing, income and higher education, we likewise opened the oppor\u00adtunity to the common man to become a proprietor and to be\u00adcome acclimated to the responsibilities of such station. It was for this purpose that the Administration sold the National Development Company textile mills in Manila to the labor unions. This bold experiment, which is an unprecedented case in Philippine labor history, is a manifestation of our pro\u00adfound desire to improve the lot of the common people. Should the workers succeed in this epochal grant of opportunity to them to become proprietors, the gates of similar oppor\u00adtunity will be opened wider in other disposable government enterprises.\r\nHaving passed successfully through the crucial period of transition from a controlled economy to free enterprise, it is time that decisive action be taken to effect the now long-delayed land reform. Land being our most valuable resources, salutary changes is imperative in the land system. Our agricultural productivity has tended to be static; farm incomes have re\u00admained below subsistence level.\r\nThe most basic cause of this failure is the land tenure system. About one-half of our farmers remain share-croppers, perpetually in debt to landowners who not infrequently are non-resident landowners. So long as this condition persists, agricultural development will be sluggish. The structure of agriculture needs to be recast before any appreciable growth in productivity and incomes can be possible.\r\nThe Land Reform Act of 1955 has failed to bring about significant changes. Still intact is the tenancy system which tends to perpetuate traditional farm methods as it provides no incentive for greater production. Under this system, in\u00adcreases in yield through scientific farming accrue mostly to the landowners. On the other hand, for his extra effort and investment a tenant receives less than one-fourth of the net proceeds from improved farm practices. The inevitable result is apathy among tenants towards more productive farm techniques.\r\nWe must now confront the land problem with the realism, courage and boldness that the situation demands. We must no longer stall or equivocate. The time has come to abolish tenancy in our farms.\r\nWe should replace tenancy with owner-cultivator ship with due regard to the just rights of the former landlord. As a people who take pride in freedom as a way of life, we must now do away with tenancy which has become the centuries-old tattoo of economic slavery and social degradation for the man who tills the farm. We must establish a new and economically-sound set-up in which the former tenant will be\u00adcome a dignified participant in bringing forth the productivity of the good earth. We must give the tenants liberty from economic peonage, in which they have long languished, so that they will become free men who will share with dignity in the task of building the Nation.\r\nIn doing this and in setting up the tenant farmers as in\u00addependent landowners, we shall release tremendous productive energies that will boost economic and social development. We shall release large capital resources tied up in absentee land\u00adlordism to business and industry. We shall set our tenants free from poverty and debt.\r\nAn over-all program to abolish tenancy, as well as to assist farm laborers and wage earners, the free settlers of public land and farmers owning private land of less than family size, will bring about an overdue readjustment of our social struc\u00adture; it will correct the present imbalance in our society, where there are enormous concentrations of land, wealth and political power in the hands of a few. It will set loose the energies of millions, put new life in the rural areas, and raise pro\u00adductivity, mass income and purchasing power. Not least, the land reform program will make democracy truly meaningful to our people.\r\nIn addition to the specific measures we have implemented to cushion the lot of the common man during the transition to a decontrolled economy, it would be well to mention the services of those government agencies primarily concerned with our people\u2019s welfare.\r\nAs industrial peace is essential to the nation\u2019s economic growth, the Administration\u2019s policy is to promote labor-manage\u00adment cooperation concomitant with the growth of free and responsible trade unions. The Department of Labor has been increasingly active in the role of arbitrator and conciliator for both Labor and Management. With the Department\u2019s active assistance, around four hundred collective bargaining agree\u00adments were signed and close to three hundred other agreements adjusting grievances were reached.\r\nWe have commenced action against unscrupulous labor leaders in order to protect labor from exploitation from their own ranks. It is hoped that the limited action we have taken in this regard will sufficiently promote responsible labor leader\u00adship for the well-being of the workers and that, toward this end; it shall not become necessary to expand deterrent measures.\r\nAt the same time, the Administration successfully extended the protection of the law to farm workers, particularly in the sugar industry.\r\nLabor-management frictions are bound to arise especially in a growing economy, as evidenced by the occurrence of labor strikes which spurred undue excitement last year. It may be pertinent to note, however, that while over 32 per cent of the strike notices filed with the Labor Department in 1961 matured into strikes, the comparative figure for 1962 was only 17 per cent, a figure almost twice less than that for 1961.\r\nBasic to the efforts toward economic expansion and the growth of social benefits to the common man is the proper education of the citizenry. It was toward this objective that the Department of Education formulated policies and imple\u00admented measures to improve the quality of instruction and to strengthen the curricula in all levels of instruction. Thus, during the past year, 13,000 new classes were opened by the Department of Education on the elementary level as compared to 10,300 new classes opened during 1961.\r\nThrough the Department of Health, the Administration directed intensive efforts toward the prevention, if not the total elimination, of the diseases and epidemics which threaten the health of our people.\r\nWhen we assumed the burden of handling the people\u2019s affairs the most pressing problem of health which confronted us was the raging El Tor epidemic. Through the aggressive implementation of health control measures, the authorities were able, within a short period of time, to contain the epidemic.\r\nIn the same manner, we have acted vigorously to meet a possi\u00adble smallpox threat from abroad by ensuring an adequate supply of vaccine through importation.\r\nThe Health Department has expanded its rural health units with the establishment of 33 additional ones, while expansion of hospital services was achieved through the completion of 31 hospitals with a total capacity of 1,050 beds.\r\nThe Social Welfare Administration, for its part, has un\u00addertaken the construction of a Regional Vocational Rehabilita\u00adtion Training Center for the blind and other physically handicapped. Moreover, it has implemented creditably Republic Act No, 3467 which created a Calamity Fund of P14 million for the rehabilitation of some 45,000 families who suffered in the floods and typhoons that ravaged the country early last year. Material aid valued at P250.000 was extended to some 64,000 destitute families. The political factor in the dis\u00adtribution of relief by the SWA has been virtually eliminated.\r\nA regular committee on relief has been created headed by the Executive Secretary and the Social Welfare Adminis\u00adtrator. This has made possible the instantaneous ministration of relief in the event of calamities.\r\nAside from attending to the pressing problems of restoring stability to the economy and providing for the immediate needs of the people, we addressed our efforts to the third goal of the nation\u2019s socio-economic program of providing a dynamic basis for the future growth of our economy.\r\nUpon adoption of the Integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Program, which aims at increasing our gross domestic product over the five-year period at a compound rate of 6%, we es\u00adtablished the technical staff for translating this basic program into action. We started the operation of this machinery for the implementation of the Program without delay.\r\nThe machinery that we set up for implementing the Pro\u00adgram was in consonance with a basic philosophy that should bear on all government decision-making: that all the public resources at the disposal of the Government shall be pro\u00adgrammed and allocated carefully and efficiently and concentrated on projects that contribute most substantially to the country\u2019s productivity. Our procedure departs radically from the past methods of wastefully allocating the government\u2019s capital funds in a haphazard, uncoordinated and dissipated and often political fashion, resulting in the forfeiture of the large benefits the country could have obtained had they been pro\u00adgrammed more rationally and imaginatively.\r\nIn addition to creating new bodies, we have revitalized existing agencies and rapidly transformed them into effective executive arms for implementing our economic program.\r\nThus, the integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Program is now underway. The Government is now financing a set of capital and development projects under a special three-month master budget which we have drawn up within existing authorizations for the purpose of continuing or com\u00adpleting those existing projects that have immediate priority in terms of the requirements of the over-all Program. These projects are now being undertaken by the Department of Public Works and Communications, National Power Corporation, NAWASA and other appropriate government agencies.\r\nThe implementation of the Program will require the con\u00adtinuous construction of fixed and lasting facilities, on the part of the private and the public sector, for the production of necessary goods and services. In the private sector, these facilities include new farms and farm improvements, new factories, and more mining facilities. In the public sector, they include those basic overhead facilities such as roads and bridges without which the private sector can not advance.\r\nIn the public sector, the Government has the responsibility of using its resources wisely and imaginatively to build, as permanent structures, the social capital necessary for the coun\u00adtry\u2019s growth. We accept this in order to stress the long-term nature of our undertaking, to underscore the need for legislative cooperation, and to emphasize the need of concentrating the government efforts and finances on integrated and long-term projects, rather than spreading them thinly on activities that may give the impression of immediate accomplishment but contribute little to lasting social productivity.\r\nIn the private sector, the Government\u2019s efforts in imple\u00admenting the over-all economic program will be to facilitate the growth of private enterprise. The specific projects that we have scheduled during these five years in the field of trans\u00adport, communications, and allied public services are aimed at providing the private sector with the facilities which it needs in order to establish and expand its productive ventures. It is the responsibility of the Government to formulate and execute policies that would establish the proper climate, as well as to provide a framework of legal and administrative precepts that would attract the private sector into channeling its resources into those enterprises that are most desirable from the national viewpoint.\r\nThe promotion of high-priority private industries under a system of free enterprise is the most challenging task that faces the Government. It is a task that demands imagination, sensitivity to the businessman\u2019s problems and goals, and de\u00addication. Indicative of the prospect of successfully meeting this responsibility, we are happy to report to Congress that no less than P1,060,000,000 in new ventures have been formalized in 1962 and that work on these enterprises has begun.\r\nOne of the basic reasons for dismantling exchange controls was to provide a more stable, rational and realistic basis for the formulation of business plans, in place of the artificial attractions created by the controlled rates in favor of industries that were highly dependent on imported materials. Accord\u00adingly, we have established the proper climate for encouraging more ventures into the following basic fields: steel; the fabri\u00adcation of metal products, including machinery and appliances; basic chemical and fertilizer; glass and cement; veneer and plywood; pulp-making; food processing and packing; and allied industries.\r\nWith the end in view of laying a basis for the future growth of domestic industries in wholesome directions, the Government has spent the past year in preparing and estab\u00adlishing the machinery for assisting these industries along two principal lines: first, in the area of project development; and second, in the area of financing.\r\nIn the area of project development, we have taken measures to help industrialists in the difficult process of preparing and planning for ventures in which the country has had little experience. Among others, we have concluded arrangements with the Agency for International Development (AID) to cooperate with the Philippine government in establishing in this country on a long-term basis, an office of technical men from abroad with extensive experience in the engineering, financial, eco\u00adnomic and market planning of projects. Their main function will be to assure the soundness of projects that local businessmen are planning to undertake, and make them acceptable for financing by foreign institutions were necessary. We have also charged the Department of Commerce and Industry with the task of serving as the clearing house of business problems and of minimizing, if not eliminating, the thousand and one bottlenecks in obsolete government procedures and requirements which have been left over from a decade of controls.\r\nWe have also readied ourselves to take positive steps to encourage and provide the proper climate for savings and investment among the small people, so that the opportunities and rewards offered by industrialization and economic growth will be extended to them not only as workers but as owners as well.\r\nIn the area of financing, in fulfillment of a plan announced in our message last year, the Government has pushed through the establishment of the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines, which will mobilize and provide the long-term capital which industries of the future will need. The Corpo\u00adration will start operations within the first quarter of this year with total investible funds of P112.5 million including $15 million which will be contributed by the World Bank, P7.5 million from fifteen foreign banks, and P27.5 million by the Department of National Defense in collaboration with the AID. It is hoped that the AID will make up to our military organization this appreciation for the priority of our eco\u00adnomic progress by using its good offices to augment future military assistance to our military forces.\r\nWe have reoriented the lending policies of the government financial institutions such as the DBP, the GSIS and the SSS in order to give priority to the intermediate and basic industries which we seek to establish in the near future.\r\nWe are gratified that in the past year, keen interest has been shown by businessmen in America, Europe and other parts of the world for the investment opportunities in the country which were opened by the Administration\u2019s policy of private enterprise. We must continue in an even more vigorous manner to welcome foreign capital and investments in. our country. Domestic capital is inadequate to sustain economic enterprises to the extent and magnitude required for the needs of our fast-growing population. Foreign capital, preferably in joint ventures with Filipinos, is needed and will be welcome in our country within the foreseeable future. As our Administration protects Filipino investors, it guarantees to foreign capital and investors fair treatment, and warrants against confiscation and expropriation. We also allow full repatriation of profits as well as capital.\r\nWith the foregoing integrated and coordinated measures, we feel confident that we shall have laid the groundwork for a balanced developing economy.\r\nNotwithstanding the preferential attention that we have given to moral regeneration and economic growth, we have accorded due attention to all other public services. We pause now to present what the Administration has undertaken in vital fields of government although attending to all respon\u00adsibilities to the people.\r\nWith the avowed aim of raising the level of our inter\u00adnational prestige, reforms have been carried out in the Depart\u00adment of Foreign Affairs in order to safeguard and enhance the career service. The political prostitution of the Foreign Service has been firmly resisted.\r\nWith respect to our vital relations with the United States, we are happy to state that we are forging closer ties with the former mother country within the framework of political and economic developments. The approval by the U.S. Con\u00adgress of the $73 million war damage claim has done much toward closer understanding of the mutual problems confronting both countries, and has reaffirmed our faith and confidence in the sense of fairness of the American people. We are elated that the United States has increased the Philippine sugar quota, thus ensuring higher export earnings for the sugar industry and additions to our international reserves.\r\nPhilippine-American relations are closest since the found\u00ading of the Republic. No major problems exist between the two countries. We are gratified at the convincing readiness of the American Government to assist our country in every practicable way in meeting our problems. On our part, as shown by our position in the Cuban crisis, we stand ready to stand by the United States as the leader of the free world in any crisis involving our common security and the defense of mutual ideals and interests.\r\nCloser dealings have been promoted with Asian countries to a point where our neighbors have been keener than in the past to have collaborative efforts with the Philippines for common benefit and in the interest of the region. More\u00adover, closer relations have developed with other countries, par\u00adticularly with Spain. Steps have been taken to establish on a clear and stable basis the broad relations between the Philip\u00adpines and Japan and the adjustment of long-pending problems between the Republic of China and this country.\r\nIn the context of the cold war, the Philippines had firmly aligned itself against Communism. There have been some questions raised about our uncompromising stand on the matter, but we cannot afford to succumb to the ever-present temptation to relax on our stand. Although we strive so earnestly for economic progress such ideal will be futile if our free and democratic way of life is subverted and lost through lack of vigilance.\r\nThe Administration has accordingly maintained relentless vigilance in combating the infiltration of communism in vital sectors of the Government and our society. Through our suc\u00adceeding program of economic and social progress under the aegis of democracy, the communist enemy is being pushed into retreat and defeat.\r\nThe vigorous peace and order campaign launched by the Philippine Constabulary last year, which laid emphasis on intelligence operations in coordination with other intelligence and police agencies, resulted in the capture of three top communist leaders in Quezon City last July, and in the sur\u00adrender of Benjamin Cunanan alias Commander Hizon in Arayat, Pampanga.\r\nThe Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces was respon\u00adsible for the arrest last May of twelve staff members of the Chinese Commercial News which is suspected of being the propaganda organ of the Chinese Communist Party. Intense and thorough intelligence operations also brought about the discovery of Political Transmission No. 17, a subversive docu\u00adment of the Chinese Communist Party.\r\nThe most important action taken in the field of foreign relations in the past year was the official filing on June 22, 1962 with the United Kingdom of the Philippine claim of sovereignty, jurisdiction and proprietory ownership over North Borneo as successor-in-interest of the Sultan of Sulu. We are gratified at the good will shown by the United Kingdom in holding the talks in London in pursuance of our note on June 22, 1962, in which talk an opportunity has been opened for a friendly scrutiny of the Philippine claim, taken with the security problems of Southeast Asia.\r\nContrary to allegations in some political quarters, this was not a precipitate action. We have personally studied this claim over a period of years. While serving in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1946, upon a study of this claim in connec\u00adtion with our successful negotiation for the reacquisition of the Turtle Islands, we advocated the filing of this claim.\r\nIn 1948, while serving in the Philippine Embassy in Wash\u00adington, DC, we went over the claim with an American expert in Anglo-Saxon law in George Washington University who sustained the view that this is a valid claim. When we served in the Congress of the Philippines, we successfully authored and sponsored in 1950, a resolution for the filing of this claim. Upon becoming President of the Philippines, acting on the conviction that this was not only a valid claim but that its presentation was demanded by the national interest, it became our inescapable duty to act on the bipartisan resolution of the House of Representatives on April 24, 1962, that the claim be filed now or never.\r\nThe situation is that the Philippines not only have a valid and historic claim to North Borneo. In addition, the pursuit of the claim is itself vital to our national security. We could not merely view the placing of North Borneo under Malaya, without presentation and consideration of our legitimate claim to North Borneo. Our claim to North Borneo cannot be less than the claim of Malaya to the territory not only on the basis of superior juridical and historic rights but in the vital in\u00adterest of our national security.\r\nMalaya has no valid claim or right to take over North Borneo. Furthermore, if through arbitrary arrangement, the Borneo territory is placed under Malaya, the latter cannot likely insure for long the security of North Borneo for the free world. A profound and farsighted contemplation of the present and potential security posture in the whole region will conclusively support the judgment that the restoration of North Borneo as part of the territory of the Philippines would be the durable measure that could best insure against territorial disequilibrium and restlessness in the area and could constitute the firm and stabilizing factor to maintain and safeguard the security of the region.\r\nThe project to place North Borneo, together with Brunei and Sarawak, under Malaya has already provoked a revolt in Brunei. It can be expected that Indonesia will not settle down accepting the authority of Malaya over Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. Moreover, the proposed Federation of Malaysia is not in accordance with the principle of self-determination, which is the accepted way out of colonialism, but appears to be a continuation of colonialism baaed only on an expedient of false security.\r\nIt was imperative that the Philippine claim be, as it was, made because if North Borneo was not to be by itself inde\u00adpendent but was to be placed under another state there is no valid reason why, with the legal and historic bases of .the Philippine claim, and considering that North Borneo is con\u00adtiguous to Philippine territory and vital to our security, the new State to be given jurisdiction over North Borneo should not be the Philippines.\r\nIt is vital to the security of the Philippines that North Borneo be not placed under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of another state, particularly a state on the Asian mainland like Malaya. In the event, God forbid, that Malaya succumbs to the potent communist threat on the Asian mainland, with North Borneo under Malaya, there would be created a situation in which a communist territory would be immediately at the southern frontier of the Philippines, which would pose a grave and intolerable threat to our country. Against such a threat, we know that our people will fight to the death, for they will rather die fighting for freedom than live in slavery.\r\nIn laying claim to North Borneo in pursuance of the legal and historic rights and the security interests of the Philip\u00adpines, we recognize the cardinal principle of self-determination of which the Philippines has been a steadfast adherent. In the prosecution, of our valid claim, it is agreeable to us that at an appropriate time, the people of North Borneo should be given an opportunity to determine whether they would wish to be independent or whether they would wish to be a part of the Philippines or be placed under another state. Such re\u00adferendum, however, should be authentic and bona fide by holding it under conditions, preferably supervised by the United Na\u00adtions that would insure effective freedom to the people of North Borneo to express their true and enlightened will.\r\nAside from providing the striking force in the Administra\u00adtion\u2019s relentless campaign against graft and corruption, the Department of Justice implemented measures to insure the independence of the judiciary and to attain a speedy and im\u00adpartial administration of justice.\r\nIn order to ease the congestion in the dockets of our courts, .the Justice Department brought about the filling of the sixty-two existing vacancies in the courts of first instance with men of proven ability and integrity. A closer degree of supervision was exercised over the courts. In order to enable them to discharge their duties promptly and correctly, the Department has taken measures to ensure that the courts are furnished with sufficient personnel, supplies and copies of requisite ju\u00addicial materials.\r\nThe Department is readying reform proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and promote speedy and less expensive litigations for the consideration of a Constitu\u00adtional Convention to amend the fundamental law, if and when the same is convened.\r\nMultiple and meritorious proposals for amending the consti\u00adtution have been made over a period of years. Moreover, there is need for improving the administrative machinery in order to make the Government more efficient and effective in dis\u00adcharging its functions for the welfare of the people. Similarly, the courts, below the Supreme Court require improvement to bolster judicial independence, to make litigations less tedious and expensive and to generally improve the administration of justice, particularly as it affects the common people who cannot afford long and expensive litigations. Likewise, there is need of decentralizing .our government and increasing the authority and responsibility of the provincial, municipal and barrio governments.\r\nThese imperative judicial and administrative reforms can\u00adnot, however, be attained in a manner as to be effective, just and permanently conducive to public welfare unless they are based on constitutional foundations which will provide for a synchronized and well-balanced, as contrasted with a lopsided and harmful allocation of governmental powers. They should be undertaken only on the basis of constitutional changes which will make possible a synchronized allocation of legislative, executive and judicial powers for the attainment of the best interest of the people.\r\nIt is, therefore, imperative that a constitutional convention be called to consider multifarious proposals for the amend\u00adment of the Constitution. Moreover, inasmuch as the present fundamental law partakes of the nature of a colonial consti\u00adtution in the sense that it was adopted during the time of the Commonwealth and that it could not take effect without the approval of the President of another country, it is desirable to update it in consonance with the fresh spirit of constructive nationalism that invigorates our Nation and which prefers that our fundamental law be not one for an unindependent commonwealth but a Constitution for our free Republic as the expres\u00adsion and embodiment of the true and exclusive will of our sovereign people.\r\nThere is an unassailable principle, in connection with amend\u00ading the Constitution, that the farther the constitutional con\u00advention is convoked from the next presidential election, the greater the objectivity that will be attained in the consideration and approval of a constitutional change. Unless, therefore, Congress convokes a constitutional convention in this session, the constitutional, judicial and administrative reforms so pa\u00adtently demanded by the national well-being may be well de\u00adferred indefinitely.\r\nTo strengthen our democracy and bolster the effective exer\u00adcise of the political rights of the people, we must decisively undertake electoral reforms in this session of Congress which could be applied in this year\u2019s local elections. Action on this matter has long been overdue. These electoral measures should effectively reduce and eliminate election frauds and irregular\u00adities which tend to defeat the popular will and reduce campaign expenses to the minimum in order to expand the chances of meritorious but unmoneyed citizens to be elevated to elective public office and leadership. The reduction of election expenses to the minimum necessary to conduct a reasonable campaign will also serve to curb corruption because it would do away with the need for candidates to receive contributions from parties who seek government favors.\r\nIn the field of national defense, a drastic modification in the plans of the Armed Forces of the Philippines was effected in order to make its activities more responsive to actual conditions such as the modernization of equipment and weapons, and in conformity with the Government\u2019s financial ability to meet the requirements of internal security and the commit\u00adments for mutual assistance with other countries.\r\nAmong the measures taken along the lines of internal se\u00adcurity were the following:\r\n(a) The modernization of the Philippine Air Force through the acquisition of jet aircraft and helicopters.\r\n(b) The vigorous work culminating in the capture of top-echelon dissidents and bandits and the surrender of loose fire-arms.\r\n(c) The creation of task forces to carry out peace and order and wage campaigns against blast fishing, kaingin, cattle rustling and smuggling.\r\nWe have taken measures to restore and bolster the morale of our armed forces. Among the steps taken were to enforce the retirement and other laws without favoritism and discriminations; the application of the criteria of merit, seniority and justice in appointments, promotions and assignments of army officers; increase of pay for both enlisted men and officers; and a housing program for enlisted men.\r\nWe must continue the effort to maintain and bolster the morale of our military organization and to place its various services in tip-top shape in view of their valuable service in our domestic problems of security and socio-economic effort, as well as the growing responsibilities of the Republic on the international scene. Measures should be sought in order to enable the armed forces to maintain itself efficiently and to be provided with its essential needs.\r\nAttention was given in the past year to the maintenance of peace and order by the police authorities and the Armed Forces.\r\nThe Department of National Defense has vigorously waged campaigns against smuggling, illegal fishing, prostitution, nar\u00adcotics, gambling, illegal logging and carnapping, resulting in 1he prosecution of over 2,700 cases and the apprehension of over 24,000 persons.\r\nWe must emphasize that in 1963, the improvement of the rate of economic growth shall be the main objective of our vigorous and sustained efforts. In the final analysis, it will be the resulting and solid economic foundation that will bring about the lasting benefits to our people.\r\nThis is a time of supreme challenge for all of us. To push through to advantage the gains made in the Nation\u2019s economic effort, we are called upon to adopt implementory measures that are unprecedented in magnitude. Half-measures will not now suffice. Half-measures will only endanger the success of the critical endeavor to attain an adequate degree of economic and social progress which our people urgently need and which, if we act courageously and patriotically, is now within their reach.\r\nIt is a supreme challenge to our courage and patriotism because some of these measures may not be momentarily palat\u00adable to the very people whom we seek to serve. The remedies are of the nature of medicine which is not instantly agreeable to the patient but which he must take for his good. They are measures which, heretofore, being politically disadvantageous, we should not even consider. So this is a time of test which will show who among us are sheer politicians and who are sincere public servants and statesmen. The test will be whether one will refrain or will courageously support those measures needed for the success of our economic program and for the good of the economy and the country but which may not be instantly popular with segments of the people. For those who are faithful to the country and those who are sterling leaders of the people and statesmen, there can be no choice except to support what is needed for the attainment of our goal of rapid economic growth and social progress despite momentary dis\u00adapproval from the public. To the true public servant and the statesman, there is only one duty\u2014to do with courage not what is popular, but what is good for the people.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, we respectfully recommend to Congress the following:\r\nFirst, that the economic measures submitted in last year\u2019s session and which were not passed be now enacted, namely:\r\n(1) Further amendment of R. A. No. 85, providing for the charter of the Development Bank of the Philippines, in order to increase the DBP\u2019s authorized capitalization to P2 billion.\r\n(2) Amendment of R. A. No. 3127, known as the Basic Industries Act, in order to limit the application of tax benefits to industries which can properly be denominated as basic and which require some form of incentives in order to attract investors.\r\n(3) The formal adoption by the Senate of the Integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Program.\r\n(4) A full decontrol measure as a substitute for the 20 per cent retention of dollar export receipts being made by the Central Bank.\r\n(5) An investment incentives law for the encouragement of foreign capital, as well as domestic investments,\r\nSecond, that the resolution which we submitted in the previous session for the calling of a constitutional convention be now approved.\r\nThird, that the bill submitted in the last session for the creation of a Moral Commission be enacted into law.\r\nFourth, that a bill be enacted to effect land reform, includ\u00ading the abolition of tenancy and assistance to farm laborers or wage-earners, the free settlers of public land and farmers owning private land of less than family size.\r\nFifth, that legislation is enacted to bring about electoral reforms that would reduce campaign expenses to the minimum and curb election frauds.\r\nSixth, that legislation is enacted to revise the tax structure and amend the Revised Internal Revenue Code in order to provide for a more equitable assessment of taxes based on ability to pay and to raise revenues to support the vital phases of the Nation\u2019s socio-economic development program.\r\nSeventh, that other economic measures be adopted which are essential to the proper implementation of the Nation\u2019s socio-economic development program, namely:\r\n(6) Amendment of R.A. No. 337, known as the General Banking Act, in order to expand credit facilities by granting greater flexibility to the operations of commercial banks and enable them more effectively to support their functions of extending short-term loans.\r\n(7) Amendment of R.A. No. 1937, the Tariff and Customs Code, providing for authority of the President to modify tariff duties in order to extend and expand the authority in duration and scope granted to the President under Section 402 of the Tariff and Customs Code.\r\n(8) Amendment of R.A. 1000, entitled \u201cAn Act Author\u00adizing the President of the Philippines to Issue Bonds to Finance Public Works and Projects for Economic Development, Author\u00adized by Law, and for other purposes\u201d in order to expand the Government\u2019s borrowing authority to enable it to support more fully the Government\u2019s investment program.\r\n(9) Amendment of R.A. No. 16 entitled \u201cAn Act author\u00adizing the President of the Philippines to obtain such Loans or incur such Indebtedness with the Government of the United States, etc.\u201d in order to expand the Government\u2019s authority to procure funds for economic development.\r\n(10) Amendment of R.A. No. 529, entitled \u201cAn Act to Assure Uniform Value of Philippine Coin and Currency\u201d in order to allow maximum incentives for the entry of foreign funds.\r\n(11) A law creating a Fisheries Commission which shall foster the development, improvement, management and conser\u00advation of fishery resources.\r\n(12) A law that would empower the President to reorganize the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue in order to effectively rid those offices of venalities and increase their efficiency in their vital function of collecting taxes and revenues due the Government.\r\n(13) A law creating an Export Authority which will be charged with development of export products and the ex\u00adpansion of foreign trade.\r\n(14) A law creating a Food and Drug Administration which shall guarantee the quality, purity, identity, safety and potency of foods and drugs to be provided to the people.\r\n(15) A law creating a Philippine Maritime Commission which shall provide the organizational structure for the orderly operation and growth of Philippine shipping.\r\nEighth, that other economic legislation than the above-men\u00adtioned which will assure the success of the Nation\u2019s economic program be enacted as will in due course be submitted in an integrated form in a special legislative message to Congress.\r\nThe legislative message aforesaid will embody drafts of measures enumerated in the above recommendations but the same will be merely suggestive, leaving it to the Congress and the Members thereof to formulate the bills to be acted upon along the general tenor of the proposals embodied in the Presidential message on legislation.\r\nWe conclude in the conviction that during the past year, the base has been established for a big push forward in the Nation\u2019s battle against the poverty of our people. The execution of this leap forward in the magnitude needed for success as gleaned from our recommendations is an imperative national necessity. Not to undertake this push or to attempt it half\u00adheartedly and without the mighty exertion required would be a crime to the Nation which future generations will surely condemn. The mighty effort expected entails unprecedented sacrifice on the part of the people and on all of us. Nothing worthwhile can be achieved without tremendous effort and sacrifice. To break the manacles that hold our people chaired to misery in order that they may, at last, enjoy a prosperous life cannot be done without supreme energy and self-denial. This is the .opportunity in generations for our people to reach and to enjoy the fruits of a better life, or in the alternative, tragically to make it recede again away from their reach. We are so convinced in the very depths of our soul about this that we venture the appraisal that if we fail our people in this opportunity, it would have been preferable that we had not gone into their service at all.\r\nOn our part, we ask for the continued faith and confidence of the people in our labors and assure them that ail that we do is for their sake and for their well-being. It is not easy to lift our masses out of poverty but we will do what can humanly be done within the period of our mandate to succeed. Having attained the highest honor that a Filipino can dream of, especially for one of our very humble origin, we have no more interest in the discharge of our office except the interest of our country and the prosperity of all our countrymen. As a warranty of our complete devotion to our duty, my wife, children and myself have together vowed to God, to ourselves and to our people that while I shall strive to spread prosperity to our countrymen, on our part, during my incumbency, we shall not enrich ourselves even by one centavo beyond my statutory compensation.\r\nWith faith in God Almighty Who watches over mankind, we shall go on, with the collaboration of all well-intentioned countrymen, to pursue and seek, undaunted and unrelenting, that state of nationhood when the Filipino race shall enjoy as a normal state of affairs a blissful and dignified life of plenty for all.", "title": "The State of the Nation 1963"},

Garcia", "text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered on January 25, 1960]\r\n\r\nMr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress:\r\nIn the light of what has been accomplished since I last had the honor to address you, it is with an uplifted spirit that today I call for further determined and courageous action toward the great national goals.\r\nDuring the year 1959 we touched a few peaks in progress\u2019 highway. We piled up bigger surpluses in. rice and corn, thus firming up our success in the campaign for self-suffi\u00adciency in food. We have achieved favorable balance of trade for the first time in postwar years which is a definitive index of our economic growth. The nation was thrilled by the discovery of oil in Cebu which, together with steel, will give revolutionary impetus to our agro-industrial econ\u00adomy. Oil will soon be a mighty pillar of our economy. We launched the first ship built by Filipino naval architects and engineers which established once and for all our capacity in this field. This is significant and inspiring when we consider that we are a country of 7,000 islands. We have successfully conducted a peaceful, free and honest election in which the Filipino people reiterated confidence in the present Nacionalista administration. It was an untrammeled expression of the popular will and the overall result was the strengthening of the fabric of Philippine de\u00admocracy. We have just laid the cornerstone of a Nuclear Center made possible by the United States granting us an Atomic Reactor. We have thus been ushered into the thres\u00adhold of a spectacular industrial revolution with the use of atomic energy.\r\nAll of these achievements in the past year, to mention only the most outstanding, are at the same time pledges at a bigger tomorrow.\r\nThe \u201dFilipino First\u201d policy of this administration re\u00adceived a resounding popular indorsement in the last election. Politically we became independent since 1946, but econom\u00adically we are still semi-colonial. This is especially true in our foreign trade. This policy is therefore designed to regain economic independence. It is a national effort to the end that Filipinos obtain major and dominant participa\u00adtion in their own national economy. This we will achieve with malice towards none and with fairness to all. We will accomplish this with full understanding of our inter\u00adnational obligations towards our friends of the Free World. We will carry this out within the framework of our special relations with the United States to whose citizens we granted until 1974, by Constitutional provision, equal rights as Filipinos in the exploitation of our natural resources and public utilities, and to whom we also granted trading parity rights under the Laurel-Langley Agreement. Under this policy we will welcome friendly and understanding foreign capital willing to collaborate with us in the exploitation of our vast natural resources preferably on joint venture basis.\r\nIt is my hope that legislations under this orientation will be enacted this year.\r\nIn vital matters related to the national economy, at the start of last year, we were facing serious difficulties. The international reserve stood at a dangerously low level and the financial position of the government was weak. So when I came before Congress to speak on the state of the nation, I proposed bold and decisive moves to stabilize the economy.\r\nCongress in a historic special session patriotically re\u00adsponded by exacting a stabilization program the principal feature of which is the imposition of a margin fee on the sale of foreign exchange. In the middle of July a 25 per cent margin was put into effect.\r\nIt speaks highly of the courageous statesmanship of this Congress that in spite of a stormy opposition accompanied by gloomy predictions of the prophets of doom, it passed the measure even in an election year.\r\nNow after barely five months of implementation thereof we find that we were able not only to halt the country\u2019s deteriorating balance of payments, but also to reverse it for the first time in postwar years from minus to plus, The 25 per cent margin on foreign exchange sales com\u00adbined with the other disinflationary fiscal and credit re\u00adstraint measures such as new tax laws, the cutback in bond financing, and such monetary instruments as the raising of reserve requirements, the raising of rediscount rates, selec\u00adtive rediscounting, the imposition of portfolio ceilings, and the continued effectively of Central Bank Circular No. 79, have produced general salutary effects upon our national economy. Among these are: (1) the strengthening of the peso, (2) the strengthening of our international reserve to the tune of $162.9 million, (3) the consolidation of the gov\u00adernment\u2019s financial position, (4) the cutting down of exces\u00adsive money supply, (5) the keeping down of excess bank reserves and credit, and (6), worthy of repeated mention, the attainment for the first time in postwar history of a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments to the tune of $46.4 million. Moreover, we paid in 1959, $84 million of our foreign loans and obligations.\r\nWhat consequences followed the overall strengthening of our national economy resulting from these stabilization measures? They are visible and tangible. First and fore\u00admost, we have signaled away forced devaluation which would have been inescapable under a runaway inflation. By achieving this, we saved the masses of our people- by preventing the ruination of their wages and salaries, their savings, pensions and insurance, and other social security benefits. Secondly, the Republic gained in credit and con\u00adfidence abroad and this is evidenced by many offers to us of credit lines and loans by governments and great banking and financial institutions all over the world. Thirdly, pro\u00adduction on all fronts\u2014manufacturing, mining and agricul\u00adture\u2014has pushed on to new heights. Fourthly, we have succeeded to establish a climate for bigger investment of domestic and friendly foreign capital and know-how needed to utilize and exploit our national resources, especially the oil mines and the laterite mines.\r\nIncidentally, there are loose talks of repealing the dollar margin law on the alleged ground that prices have zoomed up owing to it. We found, however, that, in general, prices have risen slower than costs. This indicated that business profit margins absorbed a sizeable share of the tax burden. The increase in prices for prime commodities consumed by the masses was not due to the dollar margin law, but to certain tax laws, the higher tariff rates on United States goods, and principally the general upward trend of produc\u00adtion costs and prices at the sources of these imported com\u00admodities. The latter is beyond our control.\r\nOn the other hand, while retail prices for domestically produced commodities increased by 5.1 per cent from June to November, they still stood below their levels the previous year, owing largely to increased output in agriculture and the domestic industries.\r\nBe that as it may, may I state as emphatically as I can that, if the stabilization measures Congress enacted last year did not halt the increasing momentum of last year\u2019s inflation, the ravages of the then impending run-away inflation would have exacted from us not 25 per cent, not even 100 per cent but perhaps from 500 to 1000 per cent rise in prices. That would have been a national catastrophe.\r\nGreater efforts should be made to diffuse the benefits and balance the economic development among the rural regions of the country. During the past year, I consistently advocated the dispersal of industries to the provinces to halt the dangerous tendency of overcrowded population in cities and to stop inflation of monetary circulation in Manila and suburbs while there was scarcity of money in the provinces.\r\nThe success of our program of self-sufficiency may be gauged by the increasing surpluses of rice and corn. Such surpluses have not only introduced price and marketing problems but also necessitate the reorientation of our production policies along the following lines: (1) redirection of our research activities towards high-yielding varieties suitable to the needs of foreign markets; (2) further studies in the development of new industrial uses of agricultural surpluses and raw materials; (3) improvement in our man\u00adagement practices so as to increase the production per hectare and thereby reduce the cost per unit of output; and (4) attunement of production to market demands so as to avoid undisposable surpluses and achieve steady and fair in\u00adcome for farmers. For instance, some Virginia tobacco lands in the Ilocos provinces, in the face of a soaring tobacco surplus, may be shifted to cotton production needed by our expanding textile mills.\r\nWe must now take bold and definite steps to improve the mechanism for internal marketing and distribution and develop a sound credit structure that will sustain the growth of agriculture and the agricultural industries. In the field of crop loans for small farmers underwritten by the ACCFA and the Development Bank of the Philippines to the tune of P50 million, there is need for more aggressiveness and liberality in credit mechanism to shake off alien control. The Rural Banks now numbering 126 should be strengthened by further government aid in capitalization so that they can participate more effectively in the campaign to regain Philippine control in rural areas.\r\nOur experience during the last few years indicates the utmost desirability of a practical shift from a public market\u00ading system to a more active role on the part of private enterprise. In the case of rice and corn marketing, it is both urgent and propitious that our Government banks and the rural banks back up a structure of long-term credit assistance to private warehouses and millers.\r\nDuring the year under review, we also made steady progress in land reforms and public land distribution. The NARRA resettled over 1,000 settler-families, mostly m the provinces of Bukidnon, Lanao, Cotabato, Palawan and Isabela. The Bureau of Lands continued to extend the Survey and subdivision of disposable public agricultural lands, and distributed during the year over 23,000 land patents.\r\nWhile farmers should be extended all possible assistance as far as credits and marketing facilities are concerned, I believe, that in the long run, the continued subsidy and price support of certain products will do more harm than good to public welfare. There is clear indication that a realistic reexamination of our laws on price support be undertaken before it is too late.\r\nI am proud to inform Congress that in the community development program under the PACD and with ICA assistance, we rose to unprecedented heights of achievement. At the death of President Magsaysay we had 2,110 com\u00admunity development projects in 1,185 barrios. Now we have 21,480 projects in 5,425 barrios of which 9,293 were undertaken in 1959. These community development proj\u00adects range feeder roads to community assembly houses, poultry, artesian wells, barrio waterworks, communal ir\u00adrigation, and others.\r\nThis phase of social service fully deserves the generous support of Congress which I hereby request.\r\nI wish to call attention again to the matter of developing new foreign markets for our products. I have directed the resumption and conclusion of trade agreements with Germany, Japan, and other countries. A diversified market will enable us to sell our products at the best possible price and thus maximize our income. As United States duties become increasingly heavy on Philippine goods under the Laurel-Langley Agreement, the problem of diversification becomes more marked.\r\nA significant development in this regard is the fact that half of our trade is now conducted with countries other than the United States, particularly with Western Europe and our Asian neighbors, whereas ten years ago, three-fourths of our trade was exclusively with America.\r\nWe should explore the possibility of price adjustments on our products to make them more competitive with similar products of other countries. The method open to us in our campaign for higher export receipts are indeed many and varied, among which are the institution of quality control, the encouragement of more intensive processing, a more in\u00adtensive development of by-product industries in order to utilize what is now waste, and stepped-up specialized ex\u00adploration to find more industrial uses of our sugar, abaca, coconut, tobacco, etc.\r\nLast year I recommended the repeal of Republic Act No.1410 with a view to plugging the loopholes provided through barter. While this law was repealed, another law, Republic Act No. 2262, was approved, designed to provide incentives directly to producers. This was done, I understand, in realistic barter. Undeniably, there are also a few marginal indus\u00adtries on which the employment of a large number of our people actually depend and for which barter alone offers better chances of survival.\r\nIn this connection I beg to announce that the rice and corn surpluses of 1959 are bigger than the 1958 surpluses, an eloquent proof of the success of our program for self-sufficiency in food. We shall also have an estimated surplus of about 20 million kilos of Virginia tobacco this year. But all these surpluses cannot be profitably sold for dollars abroad. The NARIC has failed, for lack of adequate financ\u00ading, in the price support program for rice and corn. It is increasingly becoming difficult for the Central Bank to finance the tobacco price support under the present law. In rice and corn, prices have gone down lower than production cost. It has therefore become imperative that we decisively act to find the solution to these problems. Meantime barter for these surpluses seems the only way to provide a. incentive directly to producers.\r\nThe cold fact of our fiscal situation has been and contin\u00adues to be that the country\u2019s revenue structure is no longer capable of supporting the irreducible requirements of a national program of accelerated social and economic devel\u00adopment.\r\nThe authorized expenditures from the General Fund, including P99.4 million of supplementary appropriations approved last year, now total P1, 487.8 million.\r\nSince the General Fund income estimates amount to P900.5 million only, we have been constrained to continue the policy of stringency in government expenditures. The expenditures of appropriations aggregating P565.2 million had to be stopped and forced savings of P22.1 million had to be imposed on all departments, bureaus, and offices of the Executive Branch. Total obligations from all funds combined for 1960 have been reduced by P147.3 million.\r\nIn our effort to pursue our fiscal stabilization program and to minimize the inflationary pressures generated by large-scale public spending of the proceeds of bond issues, we have effected cutbacks in public works and economic development projects. We have reduced the bond funds for these purposes from P126.2 million to only P70.3 million.\r\nOur revenues have increased consistently from year to year, from P530.8 million in 1953 to P789.4 million in 1959. Yet these increases have not been sufficient to cover the rise in government expenditures required by an expanding economy and a rapidly growing population. Consequently, we have to face the problem of balancing the budget every year by careful programming and retrenchment measures on public expenditures.\r\nThe answer to this mounting budgetary problem is, of course, increased revenues. At the present juncture it is not necessary to increase the taxes. It is attainable through an improvement in the efficiency of our tax collection machinery, a revamp of the existing tax system and rev\u00adenue structure, and a coordinated effort on the part of both the Legislative and the Executive branches in formulat\u00ading and implementing an equitable tax system. Toward this end, my recommendation for the establishment of a Joint Legislative-Executive Tax Commission was approved by the Congress. I urge you to consider carefully the recommenda\u00adtions which this Tax Commission will submit within ten days from today.\r\nWe have continued to extend the benefits of education to an increasing number of children. Last year we were able to admit 119,000 new pupils by opening 3,000 additional classes.\r\nHowever, because of budgetary limitations, the Govern\u00adment has had to fall back upon private institutions to supplement its educational efforts. To maintain the highest standards possible in these schools, an increase in the super\u00advisory force would be desirable.\r\nThe teaching of science and mathematics as well as the improvement of the vocational curricula received greater impetus during the year. Radio broadcasts through a dona\u00adtion of 500 transistor radios from the Australian Government were started this year. The production of foodstuffs, as well as the promotion of home industries, has been pushed with greater vigor.\r\nThe creation of the National Science Development Board has given fresh impetus to the promotion of science and technology. Its research activities are geared to economic development and national health. For the first time all the research projects for the control of the dreaded kadang-kadang of coconuts have been consolidated in a Research Committee under the Board.\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of this message, the cornerstone of an atomic research center has just been laid. A reactor has been donated by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. With the establishment of this center, we will engage in the production of radioisotopes for the use of agriculture, industry, and medicine. This is a land mark in our scientific progress, as it opens up for our youth the vast field of nuclear science and ultimately harnesses the mightiest industrial power known to man to cancel human poverty from our land. I submit that no project more deserving of full support by Congress than the nuclear center.\r\nAside from pursuing its primary mission, the Department of National Defense has supplemented the rural develop\u00adment program of the Administration. In this connection, I wish to inform you that plans for the implementation of the Armed Forces commission under the law to engage in public construction, food production, land resettlement, and rural development in addition to its inherent duties have been completed. In fact, several projects are already being actually undertaken.\r\nOur Armed Forces, I am proud to say, has done well in the maintenance of peace and order and the enforcement try\u2019s defense structure. We have every reason to be proud of the laws. It was the principal arm of the Commission on Elections that conducted in 1959 free, peaceful, and honest national elections. Its civilian chiefs and its general staff have accomplished much in the way of improving the count of its officers and men. They will continue to be an in\u00advaluable asset to the life of the nation.\r\nUnder the retrenchment policy, the Government has confined itself to the construction and improvement of only essential public improvements which are supportive and promotive of agro-industrial development. Nevertheless, during the calendar year 1959 the Government undertook the construction of irrigation and water supply systems, flood control and shore protection works, airfields and airports, ports and harbors, and roads and bridges for which we invested One Hundred Sixty-Nine million pesos (P169 million). Worthy of note is the completion of national and communal irrigation systems and the installation of irriga\u00adtion pumps, all of which can now irrigate about 45,000 additional hectares of agricultural land. The year 1959 also saw the virtual completion of the construction of 768 kilometers of development highways in Mindanao.\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to the emerging need of legislation directed towards the multi-phase utilization and ex\u00adploitation of the abundant water resources of the country not only for power, but also for water supply, flood control and irrigation. In this way we can maximize the benefits for lowest cost.\r\nIn the case of other public works financed with dollar loans being extended both by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Development Loan Fund for transportation projects\u2014air, land, and water\u2014committed under the Eisenhower-Garcia communique on the occasion of my last state visit to the United States, legislative measures are necessary to make available sufficient peso support for projects already submitted to, or approved by, these lending institutions.\r\nThe health of the nation has been maintained at a satis\u00adfactory level. The birth rate has shown a considerable increase whereas the death rate has decreased. Mortality rates from the ten leading causes of death have been re\u00adduced. All of these facts indicate an improvement in the cleanliness and sanitation of our communities.\r\nThe policy of improving the rural health centers is being pursued without letup. To supplement the services which have been made available to the rural areas, the help of private persons and firms has been enlisted. Efforts are being exerted to expand hospital services in the rural areas.\r\nThe problem of unemployment continues to be a major national concern. I am still of the firm belief that the ideal solution to this problem is the intensification of our industrial development program to multiply job opportu\u00adnities. For instance, the organization of more than 4,000 industrial and commercial firms in 1959 has absorbed a sizeable portion of the unemployed. It is also necessary for labor to acquire the modern technology so much needed in modern industry. It is gratifying to know that in Asia our manpower has the better technological training with the exception of Japan, but there is much room for improvement demanded by our expanding agro-indus\u00adtrial economy. The establishment this year in the Univer\u00adsity of the Philippines of an Asian Educational Labor Center for the training of labor leaders in Free Asia is a blessing to our economy.\r\nThe social security coverage for the workers continues to expand under the Social Security System for the private sector and under the Government Service Insurance System for the government sector. Three and a half million Filipinos are now enjoying the protection and benefits of our social security systems.\r\nThese measures to improve the security of the working-man are eloquent proofs of our administration\u2019s deep con\u00adcern with the lot of the workers. But it is my considered view that Congress should do more for them. It should under\u00adtake a serious study of how to facilitate laborers to participate as shareholders in the firm where they work. This system will give the workers a sense of belonging and a deeper sense of race between rise in production cost and rise in prices and thus enable our export products to compete in the world market. I commend this suggestion to your serious consideration for the sake of the millions of our less fortunate brothers who furnish the sinews of industry.\r\nThe Civil Service Act enacted during the last session of Congress has not been fully implemented by the promulga\u00adtion of necessary rules and regulations. The law has some provisions which are so vague and uncertain that they give rise to conflicting interpretations.\r\nFor instance, there was a question with respect to the power of the president to declare positions in the civil service as policy determining, primarily confidential, and highly technical. This necessitated an opinion from the Secretary of Justice, who ruled that such power could not be wrested from the President and given to any other party. The implementation of the law itself has had to be deferred because of practical considerations. For instance, the crea\u00adtion of a Civil Service Appeal Court of three members to dispose of some 300 appealed cases a year with a salary of P10,000 each a year is considered premature. It is clear in the light of these facts that Congress should take the opportunity of restudying the Civil Service Act during the present regular session.\r\nThe jet age has come and the influx of tourists in our country is bound to come if we can provide for them modern tourist facilities. It is therefore urgent that we develop as fast as possible the tourist industry which bids fair to become an important source of dollar income as it did in many countries. The need for promotional and publicity services abroad, the improvement of hotel and transportation services, the modernization of our airports for jet planes, and the preservation and development of our numerous tourist attraction spots\u2014all these require a sizeable outlay which I ask Congress to provide. This investment will surely give us returns a thousand fold.\r\nDuring the World Tourist Conference I announced my plan to proclaim 1961 a \u201cSee the Philippines\u2014Visit the Orient Year\u201d as an invitation to the world traveling public to visit our country and see the rest of the Far East. This is also the year we will celebrate the Jose Rizal Centennial anniversary for which Congress appropriated P10 million. Thailand has since responded to our suggestion to join us in a coordinated move to attract visitors to the Orient while other countries have indicated their readiness to take simultaneous action.\r\nThe government corporations made progress in 1959 in expanding the country\u2019s essential services and industries. In line with our decision to proceed immediately with the establishment of an integrated steel plant in Iligan, initial groundwork of grading and drainage has been undertaken by the NASSCO.\r\nThe establishment of an integrated steel mill will supply the missing link in our industrial development. Private enterprise should undertake this project in joint venture with the government. It is also necessary that sufficient leeway be allowed for the negotiation of necessary credit for the project so that we may tap resources in the United States and other countries.\r\nThe early development and exploitation of the Surigao laterite mineral reserves, estimated to be worth more than P270 billion, should be given first priority of Congress in 1960. The Act we approved for the development of these tremendous natural resources did not produce the desired result. I therefore urge a reexamination of our plan.\r\nIn marine transportation the NASSCO built and launched for the first time a 1600-ton vessel. Of greater significance is the acquisition of 12 ocean-going vessels of about ten thousand tonnage, to step up the carrying capacity of Philippine flag vessels from 3 to 7 per cent. We are ac\u00adquiring through the Reparations Commission 15 other ships of about the same tonnage.\r\nThe expansion of our railway lines to Cagayan and Sor-sogon has been started by the conduct of preparatory bid\u00adding by the Manila Railroad Company. Last June the Baliuag-Gapan section of the Cabanatuan line was com\u00adpleted.\r\nWe have made equally satisfactory progress in electric power development. Two units of the Binga project have been completed and the other two units will be installed by March this year. The completion of two units at the Maria Cristina power system will be undertaken with the steel project.\r\nGovernment corporations were organized to pioneer in new fields of economic and business activities where private capital or enterprise was shy. There is a consensus of opinion that most of these corporations are over-staffed and are thus saddled with over-sized overhead budgets. It is my considered opinion and I recommend that where the activi\u00adties of these government corporations can be taken over by private enterprise, and whenever their pioneering objectives have been basically accomplished, such corporations should be sold and transferred as soon as possible to private enterprise under reasonable terms and conditions, except those performing mainly social or governmental functions many of which can be converted into regular government offices or agencies.\r\nOur accomplishments in the field of foreign relations in 1959 have raised the prestige of the Philippine Republic before the eyes of the world. More and more, our voice is heard with greater respect in international councils. We have evolved a foreign policy whose cornerstones are the upholding of national honor and dignity and the promotion of a world peace with justice and honor and freedom for all. We are of the Free World, and as such we desire closer ties with all its members, particularly with the leader thereof and our neighbors in Asia.\r\nIn pursuit of this policy I made a State visit to the Republic of Vietnam during 1959 and cemented with that nation a most cordial relation. I expect to make a similar visit this year to Malaya.\r\nIn the negotiations for the revision of the Military Bases Agreement with the United States, the two governments in a common effort to enhance further their long-established friendship reached the following points of accord:\r\n1. Reduction of the life of the bases lease from 99 to 25 years;\r\n2. Considerable delimitation of bases areas, relinquishment by the United States of approximately 118,000 hectares of land, and actual transfer of the Olongapo Community to the Philippine Government;\r\n3. Previous consultation with the Philippine Government on the military operational use of the bases for purposes other than the mutual defense of both countries;\r\n4. Previous consultation with the Philippine Government before I the United States could put up missile launching sites in the Philippines; and\r\n5. Elevation to treaty commitment of United States responsibility to repel instantly attack on any portion of the Philippine territory.\r\nWe are determined to pursue this course of action until all irritants in Philippine-American relations shall have been re\u00admoved.\r\nActivation of the Philippine Omnibus Claims resulted in the actual payment to the Philippines of $23 million for gold devaluation, favorable endorsement by the State Department of $73 million for additional war damage payments, and adjustments in our obligations under the Romulo-Snyder Agreement. Plans are being worked out and steps have been taken for the reexamination of the claims rejected by the United States.\r\nWe have also reached agreement with Taipeh on the final liquidation of the ten-year-old Chinese deportee problem.\r\nWe are exploring the possibilities of expanded trade with Australia, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Taipeh, and Vietnam.\r\nIn the United Nations we have played an active role for the attainment of world peace completely free from the nightmare of a nuclear war. We have co-sponsored the resolution for the continuance of the 10-Power Disarmament Committee and the reference thereto of new disarmament proposals by Soviet Russia and the Western Powers.\r\nWe have concluded a Treaty of Friendship with Vietnam. We have also laid the foundation jointly with the Malaya Government for the formation of a South East Asia Associa\u00adtion of States for mutual assistance.\r\nWe propose to continue with our reoriented foreign policies and; to this end, I urge approval of the measures calculated to improve and strengthen our foreign service corps.\r\nIn my last message to the Congress I appealed for the enactment of appropriate measures to strengthen further the unrelenting drive against graft and corruption. Con\u00adgressional decisive action is eagerly being awaited by our people. According to the latest figures available, we inves\u00adtigated during the anti-graft campaign period 12,233 cases of various corruption in office of which roughly 50 per cent were decided and 4,024 respondents were found guilty. In spite of this creditable record of achievements, there still remains a tremendous amount of work to be done.\r\nLet me point out a few outstanding accomplishments of the PFFC assigned to Customs. It busted the so-called hot car racket, it busted the Customs brokerage racket and the Customs protection racket. It is well on the way of busting the dollar smuggling racket and the overshipment racket. Among recent cases of corruption brought out, investigated, and/or prosecuted mainly by the PCAPE are the salting away of dollars abroad, ACCFA upgrading of tobacco, anomalies in the NAMARCO, Public Service Commission, Motor Vehicles Office, traffic courts, BIR, and others.\r\nThe overall situation is such that no less than a total effort is necessary to reduce to the minimum this social cancer.\r\nIn addition to the foregoing recommendations embodied in the early parts of this message, I feel duty-bound to submit others bearing on important state matters, viz:\r\nPermit me gentlemen of congress, to reiterate my previous recommendations on the amendments to our constitution. More than ever I am convinced of the urgency and imperativeness of these constitutional reforms in response to the requirements of a growing Philippine democracy. I therefore recommend strongly prompt adoption of the fol\u00adlowing amendments:\r\n1).The synchronization of national and local elections every four years. Indeed we have to halt this continuous procession of expensive election campaigns which detract from, rather than add to, the stability of our democratic institutions.\r\n2) The election of senators on the basis of specific senator\u00adial districts. Let the conservative and stabilizing role of the Senate in our bicameral system be maintained by ex\u00adtending the terms of its members to eight years, one half, of whom shall be elected, every quadrennial election.\r\n3.) The creation of a Presidential Electoral Tribunal, to be a constitutional body completely independent from the Executive and the Legislative branches of our government, to hear and decide protect that may arise as a result of presidential elections.\r\n4) The 30-day period within which time the President vetoes or approves a certain bill should be counted from the date of the bill\u2019s submittal to the President and not from the date marking the adjournment of Congress;\r\n5) In the event the annual appropriation act for an ensuing year is not approved, the general appropriation act for the current fiscal year should be deemed continued in force until such time as the new fiscal year\u2019s budget is passed; and\r\n6) Finally, the provision on the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus may be reexamined to attune it more to the spirit of democracy.\r\nMy request made a year ago for the amendment of the Reparations Law is hereby reiterated along the following lines:\r\n1) To eliminate the grace period of 24 months granted reparations beneficiaries before payment. On the contrary, a down payment or performance bond should be required of reparations beneficiaries;\r\n2) To prohibit reparations applicants and end-users from negotiating directly with Japanese suppliers, and thereby prevent overpricing through collusion. Procurement nego\u00adtiations for reparations should be conducted directly and only by the Philippine Reparations Mission.\r\n3) To charge a service fee equally on government and private reparations transactions, so as to provide sufficient funds for operational expenditures of the Reparations Com\u00admission;\r\nbe counted from the date of the bill\u2019s submittal to the President and not from the date marking the adjournment of Congress;\r\n4) To amend in Section 2, Subsection (a), of the Repara\u00adtions Act the clause \u201dentities wholly owned by Filipino citizens\u201d to read \u201centities controlled by Filipino citizens.\u201d\r\n5) To clothe the legal officer of the Reparations Mission with specific powers and responsibility, he being the officer of the Philippine Government who may sue and be sued In court in reparations cases, and not the chief of the Reparations Mission.\r\nI reiterate my recommendation to the Congress for the reexamination of the preset method of financing our ele\u00admentary and secondary schools with a view to placing them on a stable basis. Action on this recommendation is im\u00adperative if we are to comply with the constitutional mandate to provide at least free primary instruction to all children of school age.\r\nWe should expand the scope of the activities of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office so that its proceeds could be utilized to provide rural areas with artesian wells, barrio waterworks, public toilets, and other sanitary and health facilities.\r\nA rigid enforcement of our forest conservation laws is a crying need of the country if we want to stop the insane and vandalistic despoliation of our forest resources. An auto\u00admatic reforestation system should be instituted by requiring forest concessionaire to plant five trees for every tree they cut. It is therefore recommended that any violation of the forest conservation laws committed by concessionaires or their agents should be made a cause for the revocation or suspension of their license, permit, or concession. Likewise, the use of forest clearings other than for reforestation should be cause for such suspension or revocation.\r\nRelated to our forest conservation concern is the proper exploitation and conservation of our fishing and other marine resources. These have been mercilessly subjected to dyna\u00admite devastation. Besides encouraging fish culture in our swamp lands, we should encourage deep-sea fishing.\r\nI hereby inform Congress that we received a commitment of a $3 million aid from the technical assistance program of the United Nations for the development of the dairy industry in this country. Let us take full advantage of this opportunity by providing peso support financing not only for dairy but also for cattle raising. Such industries are appropriate for rural areas which, combined with further development of our home and cottage industries, will lift up the living conditions of the masses in the rural areas. I request support for these industries, part of which may be taken from the proceeds of reparations for the sake of 70 per cent of our population living in rural areas.\r\nThe capital gains tax has worked as a deterrent to expan\u00adsion of investment. At this time when we need every peso available to be invested in our economic development pro\u00adgram, this tax has become anachronistic. I therefore rec\u00adommend its abolition.\r\nI urge immediate enactment of the bill now pending in the Senate on reformation projects for the Manila port. The port of Manila, which is the port of entry and exit of about 75 per cent of our imports and exports, must have modern port facilities to make it the best in the Far East.\r\nIn this connection may I inform Congress that air trans\u00adportation need be developed with a capacity to connect our 7,000 islands. Our international airports must rise to the needs of the jet age. We must encourage free competition among responsible air transportation companies. Our asphalt roads should be gradually converted into concrete roads. In the long run it is more economic that way. With the existence now of cement factories we should be able to do this at minimum cost.\r\nI recommend that a Graft-busting Commission be created empowered to make investigation, at its own initiative or by superior order, of all cases of graft and corruption in government offices and to prosecute such cases directly before competent court. It should be clothed with broad preventive powers to forestall the commission of graft and corruption and should be endowed with sufficient per\u00adsonnel to watch government corporations, banks, financial institutions, tax collecting offices and agencies, offices dis\u00adpensing privileges, franchises, permits, licenses, quota alloca\u00adtions and the like; and with such other offices as may be determined by the Commission.\r\nNothing will satisfy our people less than a total war against corruption. I have full faith that Congress will rise equal to the task demanded by the situation.\r\nI am glad to announce that the relative success of our stabilization measures has made it possible for us now to start planning carefully a move for gradual decontrol as envisioned in Republic Act No, 2609, more popularly known as the Dollar Margin Law. We should never lose sight of the fact that some of these economic control laws or regula\u00adtions are yet vital to our development efforts. For instance, our new infant industries still need a protective climate against foreign competition. A reckless, immediate, and total decontrol as advocated by some quarters will spell the complete annihilation of our industrialization program. In many instances, however, some of these controls may, in the course of a few years, be lifted if accompanied with the necessary tariff law revision. In the matter of controls on credit facilities, it is clearly indicated that a gradual liberalization of the same on a strictly selective basis may now be effected. For instance, the rate of interest on agricultural development loans should be fewer than com\u00admercial loans.\r\nIt is therefore recommended that a bicameral special congressional committee be created to undertake a compre\u00adhensive study on integrated gradual decontrol program with the assistance and cooperation of the Central Bank, Tariff, Customs and Budget Commissions, and also with the participation of the Chambers of Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture.\r\nGentlemen, in the past we achieved success not alone by the creative endeavor of the nation but also by the help of Divine Providence. Now we have set new goals for our people, but again, we cannot succeed alone. So we shall continue to seek and rely on the guiding hand of Him who holds the destiny of men and nations in his hand. On His mercy and His strength we rely. And after fulfillment of our aspirations, we like Moses after the deliverance of his people from Egypt, shall sing in the fullness of joy:\r\n\u201cDux fuisti in misericordia tua populo quem redemisti; et portasti eum in fortitudine tua, ad habitaculum sanctum tuum.\u201d (Exodus, 15-13). \u201dIn thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed; and in thy strength thou hast carried them to thy holy habitation.\u201d\r\nI thank you.", "title": "Address on the State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1941-01-31 12:26:57+00:00", "author": "Manuel L. Quezon", "text": "[Delivered at the Opening of the Third Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 31, 1941]\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY:\r\nThis session of the Second National Assembly is of unusual significance. It is not only held at a time when momentous events are vitally affecting the destiny of nations, but it marks the culmination of a legislative epoch which commenced with the inauguration of the Commonwealth. During these five years constructive measures were passed by the National Assembly which have enabled the new government to function smoothly and to render invaluable service to the country. But more has been done. You have initiated amendments to our Constitution designed to strengthen the foundation of our democratic institutions and to insure their stability and permanence. And because of such a splendid record the members of the National Assembly have merited the lasting gratitude of our people.\r\nAs this body is about to pass into history by reason of the recent amendments to the Constitution creating a new bicameral legislature to be known as the Congress of the Philippines, I desire to express my deep gratification at the manner in which the members of this Assembly have dealt with the many important public questions requiring their attention. I take particular pleasure in acknowledging the valuable cooperation which you have accorded me in the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. Fortunately, we are still free from the armed conflicts now raging in several parts of the world, and let us hope that we may be spared the destructive effects of such conflicts. But our fate in this respect is linked with that of the United States. We are placed in that position not only by the very nature of our political relationship with that great nation, but by our common faith in democracy and by every noble impulse that animates our people.\r\nIn these times of stress, our national security is naturally the greatest concern of our government, and we are doing all we can in this respect. But it must be admitted that with our own resources alone we are not now in a position to defend ourselves.\r\nThe Government of the United States has embarked upon a program of national defense which, we earnestly hope, includes the Philippines; for, under the terms of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the defense of our country remains primarily the responsibility of the United States. This is as it should be, because so long as we are under the American flag it rests exclusively with the United States, and not with us, to determine whether we shall be at peace or at war. The Filipino people, desirous of cooperating with the United States in the execution of this defense program, are ready to bear their full share of that responsibility. To this end, I have assured the Government of the United States, in behalf of the Commonwealth, that the entire Philippines\u2014its man power and material resources\u2014 are at the disposal of the United States in the present I emergency.\r\nIn my eagerness to expedite the organization of our national defense in cooperation with the United States and in the absence of available funds in the public treasury for that purpose, I have made representations to the Washington authorities requesting that the funds, declared by the Congress of the United States to be payable to the Philippine Commonwealth from the sugar excise tax collections and from profits derived from the devaluation of the American dollar, be appropriated to be spent exclusively for our national defense under the direction of the United States. I have assurances that this matter is being given serious consideration.\r\nAs you already know, the people of the United States have reelected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for another term of four years. This outcome of the presidential election has brought joy to the people of the Philippines because the Filipino people are confident that the United States will pursue a policy which will insure for that country and for ours the continued enjoyment of peace under a regime of liberty and democracy. I wish, on this solemn occasion, to reiterate our loyalty to America and our unswerving faith in the leadership of her great President.\r\nThe constitutional amendments initiated by this body and ratified by our people, which have for their object the broadening of the democratic base of our government, have received the unqualified approval of the President of the United States. The sympathetic consideration given to these amendments by President Roosevelt could not but arouse a deep feeling of gratitude on the part of our people. By the same token, our faith in, and loyalty to, the United States have been strengthened even more.\r\nThe approval of the amendments constitutes another recognition of the principle that, in matters purely domestic, the will of our people should prevail. This principle, which we have always maintained, had been gradually accepted by the Government of the United States and fully embodied in the Tydings-McDuffie Act. It is now the basic foundation upon which American-Philippine relations rest.\r\nI want to take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate your distinguished Speaker upon the successful outcome of his recent mission to the United States. Speaker Yulo has completely justified the confidence of our people in his patriotism and in his ability to perform this most important and delicate task. The unusually warm reception accorded him upon his return shows that the country fully appreciates the value of the work done by him.\r\nSince the establishment of the Commonwealth Government, we have pursued a definite program designed to prepare our country for independence. This program was well under way at the outbreak of hostilities in Europe.\r\nWe completed the organization of the Commonwealth Government as contemplated by the Constitution. The new government has been functioning satisfactorily, and `its varied activities have been extended in order better to serve the needs of the people.\r\nWe have adopted a plan of national defense for an independent Philippines. This plan is being carried out. Preparatory military training has been introduced in all elementary and high schools. In colleges and universities, instruction in military science for the training of reserve officers has been made compulsory. We have today a regular force consisting of 466 officers and 3,666 enlisted men excluding the Constabulary. This force has been organized to undertake the training of the annual levies of trainees and to engage in the study and planning of the most effective employment of our trained man-power in an emergency. Our total reserve force numbers 132,000 men organized into approximately 13 tactical divisions. The army and other national defense activities have been placed under the Department of National Defense, which was organized last year.\r\nSteps have been taken for the promotion and encouragement of civil aviation and the safety of air navigation. The Government has either acquired or constructed airports and landing fields. We have also established a network of aeronautical radio and weather observation stations which has greatly facilitated air travel in this country.\r\nThe judicial branch of our government has undergone important changes designed to insure an efficient and speedy administration of justice.\r\nThe creation and organization of the Court of Appeals in 1936 relieved the Supreme Court of the task of attending to a large number of appealed cases, thus enabling it to devote more time to the consideration of cases involving important questions of law.\r\nAs a result of the work of the Court of Appeals, the A determination of appealed cases has been greatly expedited. The dockets of both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are up-to-date.\r\nIn the exercise of its rule-making power and with a view to simplifying court procedure and reducing the cost of litigation, the Supreme Court has adopted new rules for all the courts in the Philippines.\r\nIn order to meet the increasing amount of court litigation brought about by the ever\u2014expanding field of the law, the complexity of modern life, and the natural growth of population, the number of judges of first instance and of justices of the peace has been increased.\r\nOur courts have been placed within the reach of the humblest citizen through the establishment of free legal aid services.\r\nThe masses of our population are more and more becoming aware that our courts are administering justice to the rich and the poor alike.\r\nThere has been a long-felt need of revising and codifying our substantive laws in order to make them conform to the customs, traditions and idiosyncrasies of our people and to adapt them to present day conditions. A Code Committee has been appointed to carry out that important task.\r\nIn order to improve the administration of our criminal laws, the provincial fiscal service has been reorganized and the Office of District Attorneys has been created for each of the nine judicial districts, excepting the city of Manila.\r\nWith a view to a better coordination of crime-investigation and prosecution, a Division of Investigation was created under the Department of Justice by Commonwealth Act No. 181. This Division is patterned after the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice. Its main duties are to help in the detection and prosecution of crimes and to acquire, collect, classify and preserve criminal identification records.\r\nWe have made reforms in our penal administration, the most significant of which have been the introduction of vocational training for our prisoners and the individualization of corrective treatment. A new insular penitentiary has been opened in Muntinglupa, Rizal, and this has afforded the insular prisoners greater opportunity for self-improvement.\r\nThe Public Service Commission has been instrumental in maintaining fair and reasonable rates for light, gas, and transportation services in Manila and in the provinces.\r\nIn order to regulate the issuance of, and trading in, securities, made necessary by the mining boom of 1935 and 1936, we created the Securities and Exchange Commission. Through its operation, investors are afforded protection in speculative ventures and against fraudulent schemes.\r\nTo reduce the evils resulting from the establishment and operation of certain kinds of amusement centers, I have promulgated rules and regulations in accordance with Commonwealth Act No. 601.\r\nSocial justice has been a major aim of our government during the last five years. To accomplish this objective, we have, among other things, set a minimum wage scale in public works, created the Court of Industrial Relations to settle labor-capital disputes, organized the National Land Settlement Administration to help the poorer classes transfer from congested districts to unoccupied areas, purchased haciendas to be subdivided and resold to the tenants, embarked on housing schemes for workers and low-salaried employees, intensified the campaign against usury, revised the system of taxation so that the tax burden would be borne by those best able to carry it, passed legislations to protect the rights of tenants, appointed officials to defend the poor, encouraged the organization of associations for marketing and purchasing among producers and consumers, and extended aid and credit to small farmers and businessmen.\r\nNoteworthy progress has been made in the opening of settlement projects under the National Land Settlement Administration. Organized less than two years ago, the National Land Settlement Administration has established the Koronadal Valley Project in Cotabato, where some 14,000 people have settled, and has recently started the Mallig Plains Project in Isabela, covering 66,000 hectares of the Cagayan Valley.\r\nTo date, the National Land Settlement Administration has spent about P1,500,000 of the P20,000,000 capital authorized by Commonwealth Act No. 441 from the coconut oil excise tax funds. Of the amount disbursed, about half a million pesos has been given to the settlers as loans. The National Land Settlement Administration expects, within five years, to develop four or five other settlement projects along the broad lines of Koronadal, and to distribute land to about a hundred thousand settlers.\r\nThe Rural Progress Administration has been established to assist the landless in acquiring lands and homes of their own. It has already purchased several estates and homesites, among which are: the Bahay Pari Estate in Pampanga, the Marikina Homesite in Rizal, the Tunasan Homesite in Laguna, and the Dinalupihan Homesite in Bataan.\r\nIn addition to these haciendas and homesites, the Government has leased the Buenavista Estate in Bulacan. It is a matter of satisfaction to note that whereas before misapprehension and distrust prevailed among the tenants in that Estate, now there is harmony and better understanding. There is evident willingness on the part of these people to pay their rents and to cooperate with the Government in its efforts to ameliorate conditions. As the Estate progresses, it approaches the status of an independent cooperative farm.\r\nTo provide suitable homes for our working population, we have organized the People\u2019s Homesite Corporation, with an initial capital of P2,000,000, which has taken over Diliman District bordering Manila in order to convert it into a model workers\u2019 community. Hundreds of model houses for laborers and low-salaried employees have been constructed.\r\nThe eagerness with which the people have responded to the opportunity of acquiring their own houses has been very gratifying, and the People\u2019s Homesite Corporation has plans for the construction of more houses.\r\nBesides cash loans, the Government has extended loans in the form of rice to needy tenant farmers. This work of extending credit facilities to tenants and small farmers has been placed under the administration of the Philippine National Bank, and the amount of P1,000,000 has been released for this purpose from the emergency funds.\r\nThe organized efforts of the Government to give public assistance to victims of public disasters were exerted as early as 1934 with the creation of the Board of Relief under the provisions of Act No. 4160. To further promote the security of the masses, this Board was reorganized on August 19, 1940, with the creation of the National Social Security Administration. To this new agency have been entrusted wider functions so that, in addition to giving relief to victims of public disasters, it is rendering assistance to the unemployed and studying the whole problem of unemployment in the Philippines.\r\nSince public works projects offer at present the most practicable means of aiding the unemployed, I have issued Executive Order No. 307 requiring that the only criterion for obtaining work in these projects shall be the need of employment and fitness for it and that no regard shall be paid whatsoever to political affiliation or religious creed.\r\nFrom January 1, 1934, to June 20, 1940, a total of P3,591,008.81 was spent for relief in the forms of food, clothing, medicines, building materials, and seedlings.\r\nThe Philippine Rice Share Tenancy Act, enacted in 1933, was not put in operation until 1936, with such amendments as were necessary to hasten the solution of the tenancy conflicts arising out of the division of crops. As a result of the vigilant enforcement of this law, tenancy conflicts have been reduced, and there is growing disposition among landlords and tenants to settle their differences amicably.\r\nDisputes between capital and labor have arisen now and then, but such disputes have been fortunately free from the sharp violence and bitter antagonisms that generally characterize such clashes in other places. We have helped labor fight for its rights and we have protected these rights against unjust encroachment. This has resulted in mutual respect and understanding between capital and labor, and has contributed to the promotion of social welfare.\r\nThe Court of Industrial Relations has been a potent factor in maintaining industrial peace. Its accomplishments are to a large extent identified with the substantial gains of labor, including the fixing of the scale of wages at fairer levels, the reduction of working hours, the recognition of the right of collective bargaining, and the payment for overtime work. These gains have been reflected in improved working and housing conditions, in better sanitary facilities, in better terms of employment, and, in general, in the material, physical and moral well-being of the working classes.\r\nThe functioning of the industrial court has shown that the interests of labor and capital are compatible with one another and that- conflicts between them can be adjusted without the necessity of resorting to strikes, lockouts, or other coercive measures.\r\nPeace and order has been maintained. No disturbance of a serious nature has arisen to require drastic action by the authorities. Where municipal police forces proved inadequate to cope with a threatened situation, the constabulary has always been ready to maintain peace and order.\r\nFor the first time a general election for local officials was held last December under the direction and Supervision of the Commission on Elections. The efficient and orderly manner in which the election was conducted proved the wisdom of creating such an independent commission.\r\nWith the abolition of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes in 1936, the Office of the Commissioner for Mindanao and Sulu was created to assist the Secretary of the Interior in the development work in Mindanao, and to look after the interests of the special provinces. In the five specially organized provinces, we have, whenever possible, followed the policy of placing natives in responsible executive positions. Townsites have been established, and sites for agricultural colonies properly located. The construction of roads, waterworks, port works, and other public improvements has been extensively undertaken in Mindanao.\r\nThe benefits of sanitation have been extended to all parts of the country. Because of rigid sanitary and quarantine measures, the Philippines has been spared from the ravages of dreaded epidemic diseases, such as cholera, plague, and smallpox, which have been afflicting neighboring countries.\r\nMedical aid has been increased, specially for the poor. Hospital, dispensary and other medical facilities have been substantially increased. Twelve new hospitals and 939 public dispensaries have been organized; and 500 charity clinic physicians and 95 charity clinic dentists have been employed to render free medical and dental services.\r\nGreater stress has been given to safeguarding the health of infants and mothers. While in 1935 we had only 196, we now have 319 puericulture centers.\r\nMeasures for the protection of the health of industrial workers have also been adopted and enforced. The campaign against common diseases has been intensified. To reduce tuberculosis incidence, we have established the Quezon Institute. Malaria and other major diseases have also received attention. Seven malaria control units are today in operation.\r\nBesides the leprosarium at Culion, funds have been provided for the establishment and operation of other leprosaria in different parts of the country. Of the new regional leprosaria, the largest, the Central Luzon Leprosarium, has already been opened.\r\nA public health laboratory with modern facilities has been organized. An Institute of Hygiene has been established. The system of medical instruction in the University of the Philippines has been improved and funds for the establishment of postgraduate courses have been made available. The Philippine General Hospital has been reorganized and enlarged with the addition of several wards, including a unit for the treatment and study of cancer, for which a building is now being constructed.\r\nA separate Department of Health and Welfare has been organized with a view to effecting a better coordination of public health and sanitation, welfare, and related services.\r\nIn the last six years, the Philippine. Charity Sweepstakes has distributed a total of P7,611,230.43 to charitable health and civic institutions and organizations such as the Philippine Tuberculosis Society, the Associated Charities, national and provincial hospitals, puericulture centers, charity clinics, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, the National Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs, the Boy and Girls Scout organizations\u2014and for the maintenance of such activities as malaria control work and the repatriation of Filipinos from the war zones in China and Europe. Besides, it has distributed P939,102.42 to cities and provinces.\r\nIn our public schools now numbering 12,000, we have admitted about 800,000 additional pupils, so that today more than 2,000,000 pupils are in attendance. To insure proper support and a more rapid extension of elementary education, the National Government has assumed responsibility for the maintenance and operation of elementary schools. This reform has made possible a more efficient coordination of school finances and the full utilization of the services of teachers, and has offered increased opportunity for elementary education throughout the country.\r\nThe curricula have been revised. Character education and citizenship training have been stressed and special efforts made to develop a greater appreciation of Philippine culture. Attention was also focused on vocational education by establishing new vocational schools and by giving vocational courses in academic high schools. Considerable progress in athletics has been made as shown by a general improvement in the physique of our youth.\r\nThe needs and problems of the University of the Philippines have been surveyed by a committee of the Board of Regents with the advice of two outstanding educators from the United States. The recommendations of the committee are being considered, and some have been put into effect. The reorganization of the .University of the Philippines has been largely carried out. Commonwealth Act No. 442 was enacted directing the transfer of the University of the Philippines to a site outside of the City of Manila. Three buildings are nearing completion and the work on the plans for all the necessary buildings is proceeding as rapidly as circumstances permit.\r\nWith the extension in 1936 of government super- vision over all private educational institutions issuing diplomas or conferring degrees, as provided in Commonwealth Act No. 180, the quality of\u2019 instruction in private schools has shown general improvement. The Government has encouraged private initiative in education, but at the same time, it has adopted the necessary safeguards to protect the public interest, and to carry out the educational aims enunciated in the Constitution. Through closer supervision by the Office of Private Education, the number of competent instructors has grown, school libraries have been expanded and laboratory equipment and facilities improved. The various government boards of examiners act as technical advisory committees to the Office of Private Education and cooperate with the various institutions to coordinate government licensing examinations with teaching.\r\nWe organized the Institute of National Language to evolve a common language for our people adopting Tagalog as the basis. The Institute has completed a grammar and is now preparing a dictionary. We are gradually introducing the teaching of the national language in the public and private schools.\r\nWe have established a system of adult education. During the past four years 6,069 adult schools have been opened with more than 50,000 volunteer citizens helping in the eradication of illiteracy and the teaching of citizenship and the stimulation of vocational competence. Up to December 31, 1940, these schools had an enrolment of 581,307 adults, men and women. Over 2,500,000 copies of publications on adult education have been distributed.\r\nTo supplement instruction in the schools, the facilities of public and school libraries have been expanded. The National Library has established branches in different provinces and its facilities have been made available to an increasing number of people. Its Filipiniana collection has been enriched. Recently we acquired the Blumentritt collection on the life and writings of Rizal. Letters of Rizal have been collected and published.\r\nRoads with a combined length of 6,979 kilometers were built which increased the total length of roads to 22,959 kilometers. Particular attention was directed to the opening of new roads and highways in Mindanao to accelerate the economic development and settlement of that region. The important parts of the island are now linked by a network of roads with a total length of 3,878 kilometers, of which 1,811 kilometers were constructed during the Commonwealth period.\r\nThe construction of concrete pavements on national roads has been undertaken. We have today 362 kilometers of cement roads. Supplementing our road-building program, the sum of over P7,500,000 was spent for the construction of bridges. We have now 33 new bridges in process of construction costing more than P4,662,000.\r\nAnother important phase of our public works program was the construction of 2,362 buildings costing about P11,000,000.\r\nDuring the last five years there were constructed in the provinces a total of 134 waterworks systems and 492 artesian wells at a total cost of P5,300,000. These water systems and artesian wells are serving some 876,292 people with potable water.\r\nProjects for flood and river control costing P14,586,413 have been carried out in various provinces.\r\nFor the maintenance and improvement of our ports and the construction and expansion of port facilities, we have spent about P19,500,000. These improvements have gone far in promoting foreign and inter-island trade.\r\nImpetus has been given to coastwise navigation which constitutes the principal means of communication between the different parts of the archipelago. Nine new steamers, 19 motor ships, and more than 1,000 sailing vessels and motor launches were put in operation. Most of these steamers and motor ships were built specially for tropical use and are provided with comfortable accommodations for all classes of passengers.\r\nThe Government has given special attention to the entry of Philippine shipping firms in the ocean-going trade. It has extended credit and other facilities to several Philippine firms which enabled them to acquire ten steamers and motor vessels with a total gross tonnage of 57,236. One of these companies also chartered twelve foreign vessels which, under Filipino management and control, carry a considerable portion of our overseas trade.\r\nWith the completion of the Tayabas-Legaspi section of its main Southern Line, the Manila Railroad Company has been enabled to maintain through train operation between Manila and Albay.\r\nTo avoid unnecessary duplication of services, the company has entered into joint passenger traffic arrangements with private bus companies so that today practically all important points of Luzon can be reached by the combined train and bus lines. Wherever necessary, the company maintains its own feeder bus service. In order to foster tourist trade and to accommodate its patrons and other travellers, the company has adopted plans for the establishment of a chain of hotels throughout the country. Two new hotels are now in operation: one in Tagaytay City and another in Legaspi, Albay.\r\nThe construction of radio stations at strategic and important points has received considerable attention. Eighteen stations have been erected at Ilagan, Isabela; Larap, Camarines Norte; Port Holland and Punta Flecha, Zamboanga; Brooke Point and Binalauan, Taytay, in the province of Palawan, and other places.\r\nNo efforts have been spared to protect and promote agriculture and commerce.\r\nWe have eliminated locust infestation and reduced destruction by other pests. The introduction of dangerous plant diseases into the country has been checked through a rigid plant quarantine service.\r\nControl of animal diseases through quarantine and vaccination has, likewise, been effected. Since 1938 no case of rinderpest has been registered.\r\nFishing laws and regulations are more strictly enforced. Various fishery stations have been opened and adequate facilities have been provided, as well as personnel to study the propagation of needed fish varieties.\r\nThe survey and subdivision of public lands has been expedited to have lots ready for settlers and to insure the equitable distribution of public lands by preventing the acquisition of big landholdings.\r\nThrough an extensive soil and agronomical survey now being undertaken, we shall soon be in a position to determine the physical, chemical and biological properties of our agricultural areas and thus secure the data essential to scientific agricultural planning and land cultivation.\r\nThe production of gold and silver has been more than doubled and that of base metals has risen from almost nothing to about one\u2014tenth of the total mineral production in 1940.\r\nTo insure a continuous supply of timber and help solve the problems of soil protection, water conservation and flood control, new forest reserves, communal forests and national parks have been established and barren watersheds reforested with economically valuable trees.\r\nThe Bureau of Science has successfully undertaken experiments on the utilization of the by-products of some of our industries. As a result of these researches, factories for the manufacture of paints, varnishes, roofing tiles and other industrial products from local raw materials have been established.\r\nThe National Research Council has stimulated comprehensive projects of scientific research. As an advisory body, the Council has drawn the attention of both the Government and private enterprises to important activities requiring technical knowledge. It has catalogued our scientific and technical resources for use in any intensive scientific work.\r\nOur farmers have received assistance in the marketing of their products. Through the help of the National Produce Exchange, many producers in the different provinces, mostly small individual farmers and cooperative associations, have been able to dispose of their products without passing through middle-men, thus giving them better returns for their crops.\r\nActivities for the promotion of foreign and domestic trade have been intensified. A new Foreign Trade Division in the Bureau of Commerce has been organized to develop foreign markets and promote the sale of Philippine products abroad. Since 1939 National Foreign Trade Week has been observed annually in order to arouse wider public interest both here and in the United States in Philippine-American trade. A direct cablegraphic price quotation service from New York has made possible the daily publication and broadcasting of price quotations on all important staple products of the Philippines. The Bureau of Commerce has also helped our businessmen in establishing new business connections locally and with foreign countries and in getting useful information.\r\nFilipino participation in the retail trade of the country has increased from between 15 to 20 per cent at the time of the inauguration of the Commonwealth to approximately 37 per cent in 1939. Filipinos now outnumber the merchants of other nationalities in the local retail trade and control a greater number of retail stores.\r\nIn its desire to broaden the base of taxation and shift the tax load to those best able to pay, the Government has approved a series of measures, now embodied in the National Internal Revenue Code, to create new sources of income by increasing taxes on inheritance, income, and articles of luxury, and by imposing taxes on amusement and other activities. The code has established a more equitable tax system and provided a more adequate machinery against tax evasion or avoidance. Its adoption has resulted in a substantial increase in revenues, which, however, has been upset by present depressed business conditions. The loss of revenues occasioned by the abolition in 1937 of the cedula tax was more than offset by the new taxes.\r\nThe trend in public revenues during the last five years is shown by the following figures. The internal revenue collections rose from P46,971,774.93 in 1935 to P73,354,896.60 in 1937, the year of the mining boom; collections fell to P66,301,810.61 in 1938, but rose again to P69,331,641.20 in 1939, and, despite the beginning of hostilities in Europe, reached a peak of P74,858,920.31 for the fiscal year 1940, when the Internal Revenue Code went into effect. Customs collections showed a similar trend. Collections rose from P24,477,176.63 in 1935 to P32,125,389.93 in 1937, then declined to P28529,012.11 in 1938 and to P25,582,985.21 in 1939. Unlike internal revenue collections, however, which rose to a new high in 1940, customs collections for that fiscal year\u2014which amounted only to P27,270,275.90, because of the paralyzation of our trade with some of the warring nations\u2014fell below the 1937 level.\r\nProvincial and municipal finances have been in sound condition. At the end of the fiscal year 1940, provincial governments had an unexpended surplus of P3,127,204.09 and the municipal governments, P1,104,524.04. Various laws such as the new municipal autonomy act, the new assessment law, and the Internal Revenue Code have further strengthened the financial position of the provinces and municipalities and enabled them to meet their obligations more adequately. The change in the supervision over the finances of our local governments, placing provincial, municipal and city treasurers and provincial and city assessors under the Department of Finance, has resulted in a unified collection service and greater efficiency.\r\nIn addition to the resources of the Philippine National Bank, we have made available to the public with the creation of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank P25,000,000 which constitutes its initial capital.\r\nA direct result of the combined operation of these banks has been the scaling down of the rate of interest on loans, which has enabled the small farmer and industrialist to secure the needed protection and encouragement to carry on their operations under adverse conditions.\r\nDuring the last five years there has been a steady increase in the resources of our banks due mainly to the growth of bank deposits which rose to about P30,000,000.\r\nOn the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the total indebtedness assumed by the new government from the old regime amounted to P154,364,700 against which a sinking fund reserve of P59,287,901.73 had been accumulated, thereby leaving a net indebtedness of P95,076,798.27. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth up to December 31, 1940, new bonds in the total par amount of P5,392,300 had been issued, but on August 1, 1939, Public Works bonds issued on August 1, 1909, amounting to P3,000,000, were retired, thereby leaving a net issue of P2,392,300. The sinking fund reserve increased from P59,287,901.73 in November, 1935, to P75,980,484.01 at the end of the calendar year 1940. The status of the public debt as of December 31, 1940, was as follows:\r\nBonds of the National Government (proper) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.

P75,980,484.01\r\nNet bonded indebtedness of all classes \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 P 72,776,515.99\r\nThe above figures show that during the Commonwealth r\u00e9gime through December, 1940, the gross and net indebtedness of the Government were reduced by P5,607,700 and P22,300,282.28, respectively.\r\nBesides these bonds of the Government proper, there were also sold P6,000,000 worth of bonds of the National Power Corporation created by Commonwealth Act No. 120, the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by the Government.\r\nThe Manila Railroad Company has also outstanding bonds amounting to P28,718,000.00. We have taken steps to enable this company to redeem its outstanding bonds upon maturity. For this purpose the National Assembly last year appropriated P7,000,000 from the Coconut Oil Excise Tax Fund. The present program of the Government contemplates further yearly appropriations from this same Fund until the total bonded debt of the Manila Railroad Company is fully covered.\r\nThe currency circulation of the Philippines during this period showed an upward tendency from 1935 to 1938, but began to decline thereafter as may be seen from the following figures:\r\n1935 (Average from November 14 to December 31, 1935) P114,648,486.98\r\n1936 (Average) 164,524,168.76\r\n1937 (Average) 181,203,519.52\r\n1938 (Average) 207,465,286.45\r\n1939 (Average) 199,044,925.28\r\n1940 (Average) 181,251,052.08\r\nThe decline in circulation began in 1939, when the present war in Europe started. Owing to the marked increase in freight and insurance rates, and to the prevailing low prices of our export commodities, there resulted a scarcity of export bills which are the main source of supply of the dollar balances abroad of local banks. To replenish depletion of said balances and to cover payments for Philippine imports, local banks had to resort to heavy purchases of exchange in Manila and New York. These sales of exchange affected the monetary circulation of the Philippines for the reason that, under the law, currency tendered for the purchase of said exchange had to be retired from circulation.\r\nThe legal minimum reserve requirement has been maintained since the establishment of the Commonwealth as shown in the following statement:\r\nThe Treasury Certificate Fund constitutes the reserve for the redemption at par of all outstanding treasury certificates. This fund is always maintained to the amount of 100 per cent of all treasury certificates issued and outstanding. The fund is constituted exclusively of Philippine silver pesos, half-silver pesos, and of dollar deposits in the United States. The status of this fund for the period covered by the Commonwealth r\u00e9gime to December 31, 1940, was as follows:\r\nYear (Dec. 31) Total Treasury\r\nCertificates Cash Balance\r\nOutstanding of the Fund\r\n1935 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 P106,369,706.00 P106,369,706.00\r\n1936 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 132,155,000.00 132,155,000.00\r\n1937 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 145,333,275.00 145,333,275.00\r\n1938 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 174,763,462.00 174,763,462.00\r\n1939 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 173,611,590.00 173,611,590.00\r\n1940 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 163,143,955.00 163,143,955.00\r\nAs early as 1937 efforts were made to readjust our trade relations with the United States through\r\na revision of the economic provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act. The Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs was organized and after two years of continuous work, it submitted a comprehensive report which served as the basis for the Philippine Economic Adjustment Act.\r\nTo carry out the main recommendations of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs, steps have been taken to reorganize the national economy by encouraging modern methods of production; by increasing the yield of land through scientific farming; by extending credit facilities to merchants and producers; by lessening the cost of distribution so as to increase the share of the producer; and by providing gainful occupations for farmers who would otherwise remain unproductive during the greater part of the year.\r\nIn the development of our agriculture, we have stressed crop diversification and the adjustment of farm production so as to bring about as much as possible self-sufficiency in articles of prime necessity, and the production of raw materials to develop domestic industries and of products that can be marketed abroad under competitive conditions.\r\nThe National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 565 providing for the organization of cooperative associations. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all government activities of that nature were placed under the National Trading Corporation. Progress has been made in organizing cooperatives among producers, consumers, and small merchants throughout the country, with a view to improving the economic condition of the masses.\r\nRealizing the need of drawing up a program for the readjustment and rehabilitation of the sugar industry, the Government has provided under Commonwealth Act No. 567 a new method of taxing centrifugal Sugar mills and owners of leased sugar lands. The Purpose of this law is to place the industry in a position to maintain itself despite the gradual loss of its preferential position in the American market; to read\u00adjust the benefits derived from it by redistributing them more equitably among the elements concerned; and to give laborers employed in the industry a living wage and improved living conditions. Research is being undertaken to increase the yield, reduce the cost of production, and propagate better varieties of sugar cane, and to utilize its by-products.\r\nSince the retroactive imposition of the tax on leased lands would have caused hardships and dif\u00adficulties to the taxpayers, the operation of this pro\u00advision of the law was suspended for the 1939-40 agricultural year. Similarly, I decided to waive the imposition of the additional progressive tax on sugar mills for the same agricultural year, as upon inves\u00adtigation it was shown that the exaction of such tax during that period, would be confiscatory and oppressive.\r\nThe National Development Company and its sub\u00adsidiaries have continued developing new industries. The policy laid down for these companies is not to enter into those fields which could well be left to private capital and initiative.\r\nThe National Rice and Corn Corporation has been able to keep the price of rice within the reach of consumers, while at the same time stimulating continued production. In carrying out its activities, the National Rice and Corn Corporation has given preferential attention to regions where its services are most needed.\r\nThe National Rice and Corn Corporation has carried on research work on longer storage of rice and the utilization of by-products.\r\nThe National Warehousing Corporation has been organized. Warehouses have been built for rice, abaca, copra and hemp in different sections of the Philippines, and it is expected that these warehouses will give farmers an opportunity to store their crops while waiting for favorable prices.\r\nThe National Footwear Corporation was established to help the footwear industry. This corporation has entered into a financial agreement with the National Footwear Cooperative Association composed of shoemakers of Marikina and other towns of Rizal, as a result of which, shoemakers and laborers now receive higher wages and are supplied with materials at reasonable prices.\r\nThe Cebu Portland Cement Company has been operating profitably. This company had completed plans to establish a factory for the manufacture of cement-asbestos roofing to replace galvanized iron. This project, however, has been suspended in view of the offer made by a private company to establish and operate such a factory.\r\nThe National Development Company has also helped in the financing of a cellulose factory for the produc\u00adtion of cellulose from sugar-cane bagasse. It is be\u00adlieved that the successful operation of this factory will help in the readjustment of the sugar industry besides producing an article which now finds a ready market in many parts of the world.\r\nThe Cotton Textile Factory was established in 1939. At the beginning it operated 10,000 spindles and 104 looms. Recently, the factory has been expanded and is now operating 20,000 spindles and 500 looms, to\u00adgether with a finishing plant for bleaching, dyeing, printing and finishing work.\r\nThe National Food Products Corporation has now under way the establishment of a cannery in Capiz, in addition to the cannery previously set up in Guagua. The Corporation is financing the construction of 5,000 hectares of fishponds under contract with private landowners.\r\nIn order to improve interisland shipping and to aid in the establishment of a Philippine ocean\u2014going merchant marine, the National Development Company has financed the construction of a modern coastwise vessel and three ocean-going ships. These vessels are now in the service and the commitments of the operators concerning interest and amortizations of the money invested by the Government have been fully met.\r\nOne of the many activities of the National Development Company during the last two years has been to effect the exploration of mineral deposits in the Philippines in cooperation with the Bureau of Mines. With the aid of experienced geologists from the United States some known petroleum-bearing areas have been explored as well as areas containing strategic minerals and other minerals needed for our industrial requirements.\r\nI have authorized the expenditure of P500,000 for the drilling for oil in several places.\r\nThe exploration of the Surigao iron deposit has been completed. In relation to this deposit, the National Development Company has had experiments made in the United States and Europe to determine the best process that should be adopted for the most economical utilization of the ore. Exploration of coal deposits has shown that several sections can be commercially operated. The Cebu Portland Cement Company is now exploiting the Uling coal mine in Cebu to its ad\u00advantage.\r\nThe National Development Company is working a coal mine in Malangas in the Province of Zamboanga. With the output of this mine and of the Uling mine, it is believed that all the requirements of the Cebu Portland Cement Company and the Manila Railroad Company would be met eventually.\r\nTo increase the local consumption of sugar and to stabilize the market for refined sugar in the Phil\u00adippines, the Government has acquired the refineries of the Insular Sugar Refining Corporation and the Ma\u00adlabon Sugar Company.\r\nPursuant to laws passed by the National Assembly, the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation, the National Coconut Corporation, and the National To\u00adbacco Corporation have been duly organized and are now in operation.\r\nWith the increased appropriations authorized by you last year, the office of the Resident Commissioner in Washington has been reorganized and now counts with a competent staff to handle all matters affecting our interests in the United States. The work of Resident Commissioner Elizalde in reorganizing that office and in developing it to its present efficiency is worthy of commendation.\r\nThe consolidation of the auditing and accounting services of the National Government was effected under the General Auditing Office. Whether or not this arrangement is conducive to greater efficiency or economy and should be made permanent, is as yet difficult to determine. Supervision by the General Auditing Office has been extended to public service companies and charitable institutions, and this has redounded to the public good, since through its findings, the Public Service Commission was enabled to scale down public utility rates to fairer levels.\r\nSince the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the constitutional precept requiring a civil service based on merit and fitness has been adhered to. This policy has been extended to embrace almost all positions in the public service.\r\nTo better insure uniformity of action, the determina\u00adtion of administrative cases has been placed in the Bureau of Civil Service and the Civil Service Board of Appeals.\r\nAlthough the work has not yet been completed, considerable headway has been made in the classifica\u00adtion and standardization of positions in the civil service in accordance with Commonwealth Act No. 402.\r\nTo provide some measure of economic security for government employees, the Government Service In\u00adsurance System has been established.\r\nThe growth of the System may be seen from the increase in the total amount of insurance from P45,919,713 in 1937 to P69,150,418 in 1940. The in\u00adcome for the first year was P2,419,544.06 as against P3,891,574.15 in 1940. The reserves of the System have likewise grown from P2,108,136 in 1937 to P9,851,604 in 1940.\r\nThe System was able to declare and distribute among its members dividends in the total amount of P1,152,402, notwithstanding the fact that the reserves have been computed on the most conservative valua\u00adtion standard known in actuarial science.\r\nThe creation of the Budget Commission as authorized by Commonwealth Act No. 5 has been justified by the results attained. The National Government has been able to maintain the principle underlying sound budgetary system that the ordinary operating expenses of the Government must be kept within its current income, except when a grave national emergency or a serious financial difficulty arises.\r\nThe Commission has been instrumental in effecting economy in the expenditure of authorized appropriations and special funds, in the coordination of various administrative services, and in avoiding the employment of unnecessary personnel.\r\nThe work of the Census Commission, for which the Assembly set aside a total of P3,600,000, is now almost completed. Some 35,000 persons cooperated in the task of compiling the data on the population of the Philippines. According to the result of the census, the population of the country on January 1, 1939, was 16,000,303. All reports on geography, agriculture, lands, forests, fisheries, mines, manufactures, construction, commerce, transportation, communication, and services are now in process of printing.\r\nControl over immigration has been strengthened by the creation of an independent Bureau of Immigration, and the enactment of appropriate measures regulating the entry of aliens into the country. The port of Ma\u00adnila is now the only unlimited port of entry in the Philippines.\r\nTo increase the water supply, the Metropolitan Water District added the Ipo Dam to the Angat System at cost of P800,000, and also the Bicti-Novaliches Siphon Aqueduct costing P467,550. The water service was extended to Las Pinas which necessitated the construction of a 200,000-gallon elevated tank at Paranaque, Rizal, costing P31,000.\r\nThe District has completed the construction of a high pressure reservoir which safeguards filtered water from pollution. With the new Santa Ana Steel bridge, the dangers of a subaqueous pipe under the Pasig River have been eliminated.\r\nTo improve fire protection in Tondo, Caloocan, and Malabon, a 30-inch feeder main from Pureza street, to Antipolo street, Manila, was laid at a cost of P178,518.\r\nThe sewage system has been improved with the initial execution of a ten-year program for the extension of pipes all over the city as far as Pasay, Rizal. The laying of a network of storm drains and the improvement of esteros have been undertaken with an appropriation of P2,000,000.\r\nWith the general reduction of the water and sewer rates and the elimination of the service maintenance charge, our rates are now among the lowest in the world.\r\nThe rapidly increasing population of the City of Manila-and the highly unsatisfactory conditions in the districts where the laborers live have constituted a problem which for a long time needed attention. To solve this problem, as well as to give an impetus to scientific community planning, Quezon City has been created, adjoining the City of Manila, and is now being developed as a model community.\r\nThe Government owns about one third of the 7335 hectares that comprise the City and can carry out this plan without the necessity of acquiring lands on a large scale for public purposes. Sites for parks, schools, markets, and other public buildings have been reserved and streets have been plotted wide enough to meet the needs of traffic. The new Capitol is now under construction at the end of a formal avenue 60 meters wide.\r\nGovernment lands have been subdivided and are being sold to government employees and to the public for homesites on reasonable terms.\r\nA zoning plan is in preparation under which busi\u00adness districts will be established in places planned for them, with adequate space for traffic and parking.\r\nA new campus for the University of the Philippines has been laid out. It contains 490 hectares, large enough to meet the needs of the institution.\r\nBuildings are now under construction in Quezon City for a proposed exposition. These buildings will serve to house agricultural and industrial exhibitions in the future.\r\nA comprehensive study of the park and recreational problems of the Philippines is being made under the direction of the adviser on national parks assigned from the United States National Park Service. This study will include an inventory of the national scenic, historic and scientific resources of the country. From this inventory a selection will be made of those areas which offer the greatest recreational and inspirational values.\r\nThe national park office is cooperating with the Bureau of Forestry and the Bureau of Public Works in the preparation of master and layout plans to control the development of the park areas.\r\nThe national park office is encouraging provinces and municipalities to develop their own park and playground systems in order to take care of local recreational needs. All possible planning assistance will be offered to local authorities. Cooperative studies are now being made of a park and playground system for a greater Manila.\r\nThe economic repercussions of the present World War are being felt more and more acutely in the Philippines. Our trade with many nations has been reduced, prices for our export commodities have gone down, and freight and insurance rates have increased more than two hundred per cent. The result has been a decline in national income and purchasing power.\r\nWe are experiencing a marked decrease in our revenues, particularly in customs collections. But a drastic reduction of government expenditures at this time might not be advisable because it would tend to aggravate business conditions. It will be necessary, however, to readjust our expenditures and make use of our surplus reserves in order to prevent a deficit at the end of this fiscal year. I shall furnish you more de\u00adtails on the subject when I submit the budget for your consideration.\r\nThe depressing effects of the war on our economic and social conditions have been aggravated by the failure of the rice crop due to the drought in many sections of the country. The Department of Agricul\u00adture and Commerce and the National Rice and Corn Corporation have estimated a fall of about 20 per cent in our normal rice harvest.\r\nWe are thus confronted with the necessity of insuring a sufficient supply of rice and of helping people in our agrarian areas to find work which will tide them over until the next harvest. While before we could import the rice needed from Indo-China, Burma, and Thailand, we now encounter difficulties in ob\u00adtaining rice from those countries. Fortunately, the National Rice and Corn Corporation has a carry-over stock of approximately 550,000 cavanes of rice which will be sufficient to cover the shortage in our stock for several months. I believe that any subsequent deficiency could well be filled by inducing our farmers to make a second planting of rice, particularly in those areas that can be irrigated.\r\nUpon the recommendation of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, I have authorized the expenditure from relief funds of the amount of P100,000 for the purchase of seeds to be loaned to farmers who want to plant rice, corn, mongo, and other food products. This plan, if it receives the cooperation of the people, will insure an adequate supply of rice and corn, and will provide tenants with work and means to carry on until next year. I have also authorized the granting of crop loans to these tenants from the emergency fund to defray the cost of planting and for the maintenance of their families until harvest time.\r\nTo give employment to those who have suffered from crop failures and to others who may need work, I have ordered the acceleration of public works projects already authorized. I feel that in times of stress, like the present, when private business and initiative are forced to limit the employment of laborers, the Government should take up the lag by expediting public works construction.\r\nIn order to reduce the harmful effects of droughts, I have directed the Department of Public Works and Communications to speed up irrigation projects.\r\nExcept for the adverse circumstances I have noted, the general conditions prevailing in the Philippines are satisfactory. We have been free from epidemics and other contagious diseases; peace and order has been maintained; litigations are being decided by the courts with greater speed; the school problem has been effec\u00adtively met; and the relations between capital and labor are gradually being established on a more equitable basis. The people are showing confidence and faith in their Government and are making greater efforts to pay their taxes. We have, therefore, every reason to be gratified at the progress we have so far attained, in spite of the disturbing effects of the international situation.\r\nIn view of the present state of our revenues, I found it necessary to order the suspension of some projects not considered urgent. I have also approved the policy of restricting the filling of vacancies in the service and prohibiting increases in salary in the same position in the upper grades. I believe the time is not opportune for expanding the existing services or estab\u00adlishing new ones. There are, however, some pressing needs which it is my duty to bring to your attention.\r\nThe frequent failure of crops resulting from droughts demands that we construct more irrigation systems. Such constructions will provide employment for laborers during this period of widespread economic stress. In order to improve our fishing industry, I again recommend that the present Division of Fisheries of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce be converted into a Bureau of Fisheries and that a school of fisheries be established under the bureau.\r\nWe are feeling more than ever the need of bringing science to the aid of industry. I desire to reiterate my recommendation made at your last session to consolidate all the scientific research activities of the Government into one research institute.\r\nTo effect a more equitable distribution of land, the Public Land Law should be amended so as to prohibit any owner of one or more parcels of land from acquiring lands by homestead and free patents the total area of which, added to that of his own land, shall exceed 144 hectares.\r\nI believe that it would be conducive to greater efficiency and economy to place all credit institutions was a one supervisory agency in the Government. I, therefore, recommend that the duties now assigned to the Bureau of the Treasury relating to insurance companies, mutual aid associations, and trusts, be taken over by the Bureau of Banking and that you authorize the transfer to this Bureau of all the personnel of the Bureau of the Treasury assigned to those duties.\r\nFor some time we have been having difficulty in obtaining certain government supplies and materials from abroad at reasonable prices. In view of this, the Division of Purchase and Supply should be au\u00adthorized, subject to the approval of the President, to purchase in advance of requisitions, supplies and materials that are regularly needed.\r\nThe Constitution provides that all educational in\u00adstitutions shall be under the supervision of, and subject to regulation by, the State. Commonwealth Act No. 180 places under the supervision of the Office of Private Education only private schools granting di\u00adplomas and certificates. I recommend that this Act be amended to conform fully to the provision of the Constitution by requiring that all private schools, ir\u00adrespective of whether or not they grant diplomas or certificates, be supervised by the Office of Private Education.\r\nI am informed that the Commission on Elections will submit for your consideration a proposal for the amendment of our election laws. I ask you to give careful consideration to this proposal, particularly in relation to the appointment of election inspectors. The present system, whereby election inspectors are appointed upon the nomination of political parties, does not insure an impartial attitude on the part of the inspectors in the performance of their duties.\r\nThe constitutional amendments shortening the Presidential term from six to four years and prescribing the tenure of the members of the Congress\u2014four years for Representatives and six years for Senators, with one-third of the members of the Senate to be elected every two years\u2014require the setting of a definite schedule for the holding of elections so that, including the election for provincial and municipal officials, they may not occur more than once every two years. To this end, I recommend that the term of office for elective local officials be changed from three to four years, effective after the next election.\r\nThe constitutional amendments recently approved require executory legislation, which, I trust, you will pass in due course. In this connection, I desire to invite your attention to the provisions of Article VI, Section 17, and of Article VII, Section 11 (2), of the Constitution, which contains inhibitions affecting mem\u00adbers of the Congress and certain officers of the Exec\u00adutive Department. I recommend that proper legisla\u00adtion be passed at this session to implement these constitutional provisions and provide sanction against their violation.\r\nConditions all over the world have changed since the outbreak of the present war. This change is bound to retard our progress towards some of the economic and social objectives that we have set. But we cannot abandon these objectives. We must pur\u00adsue them with greater determination even if their achievement should entail added sacrifice.\r\nWe cannot now foretell the situation that will arise in the world after the war and it inadvisable to adopt economic plans based on future conditions that might never materialize. In the mean\u00adtime, we should continue to minister to the health and welfare of our masses, intensify our efforts to solve the unemployment problem, speed up the execution of our program of national defense, stimulate the in\u00adcrease of our national income, insure a sufficient supply of food and clothing for any eventuality, promote social justice, push forward the extension of our educational facilities and the advancement of our cultural life, and safeguard for all our people the proper exercise of individual rights.\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, these are fateful days in which we live. Vital forces are reshaping political and social institutions the world over. Fear and want are afflicting the human race. Men and women everywhere are scanning the future for security and a more promising life. In the midst of this great crisis, our duty is clear. By a solemn covenant with America, the advent of our national independence is assured. We must prepare for it; we must not procrastinate; we must not falter. Trusting in Divine Providence, we must move forward firmly and courageously to achieve our long-cherished ideal\u2014the establishment of the Philippine Republic\u2014and to secure for our people prosperity, happiness and freedom under the shelter of peace and democracy.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},

We can hardly recognize our country after the cataclysm that has engulfed it. The war has left its livid scars everywhere\u2014on our buildings as well as on men\u2019s souls. Probably nothing can more starkly summarize our present plight than the fact that the Executive and Legislative branches of our Government have to meet today in a borrowed house because our Legislative Building is a heap of rubble and ashes, mute witness to the savage desperation of the beaten enemy.\r\nThe tragedy that has afflicted our nation has lacerated our hearts. We all miss today many dear and familiar faces that are no more. But perhaps no sorrow has touched us more deeply than the passing of our beloved leader, Manuel L. Quezon. I know, however, that you feel as I do that his immortal spirit abides with us in this hour of trial and crisis, encouraging us to proceed with the arduous tasks that lie ahead. This great man, who dedicated his entire life to his country, died as he would have wanted to die\u2014in line of duty. Soon his mortal remains, kept at the Arlington National Cemetery at Virginia, will be brought back to the Philippines, and we shall all have the opportunity of rendering him our last homage of admiration and affection. We shall erect him a monument so that we and our generations yet unborn may keep his memory enshrined in our hearts.\r\nThe Philippines is the one territory under the American flag which has suffered the most at the invader\u2019s hands. Not only are its war casualties the highest in proportion to population, not only have its cities and towns been destroyed and looted, its countrysides and farms laid waste, and its whole economic structure ruined, but its people have undergone more physical pain and mental anguish than in any other part of the United States. As early as December 8, 1941, a few hours after her felon attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan sent bombers and task forces to the Philippines. Unavoidably turned into a battlefield, our country suffered heavily in men and property, especially in Bataan, where the Filipino-American Army battled the Japanese forces for four long months.\r\nThen followed a period of enemy occupation, cruel and humiliating. No sooner had the fighting in Bataan ended than the enemy began the systematic looting of our country. There was no limit to what he could requisition with his worthless money. Even our barest necessities were commandeered. And when we tried to stand by our rights, force, ruthless force, immediately intervened. With or without cause, people by the scores were arrested and sent to prison and concentration camps\u2014some to be tortured, others to be executed. As time went on, we became more impoverished, while the enemy became still more cruel and arrogant. After undergoing three years of enemy domination, no people was a more pitiful sight than the Filipinos\u2014lean, ragged and famished.\r\nI wish to stress the fact that the extreme suffering of the Filipinos and the widespread destruction wrought on our country has been due, in a large measure, to their unwavering loyalty to the United States. No people, I believe, has given so much proof of fidelity to the cause of the mother country as the Filipinos.\r\nWhen Japan invaded the Philippines, the American flag was here. Even without that flag, Japan would probably have launched her attack. But as long as the Philippines remained under American sovereignty, the responsibility for the defense of the Islands lay with the United States. For forty odd years, in our continuous preparation for self-government, we exercised jurisdiction over matters of education, public works, sanitation and other functions of public administration, but never over our national defense. This function remained in the hands of the United States as the sovereign power. It is true that as soon as the Commonwealth was established, we started giving our citizens military training and building up a modest army, but these steps were in preparation, not for war, but for the fulfillment of our peaceful duties as an independent nation.\r\nNotwithstanding these facts, the Filipino people rallied to the defense of the American flag, paying no heed to the cost and consequences. The sad moment came when it had to be admitted that the battle was lost, since a relief force could not be sent to the Philippines. But far from wavering, the Filipino soldier, side by side with his American comrade, fought on harder than ever until he was overwhelmed by superior numbers.\r\nUnwilling to bow to the enemy, the Filipino people valiantly took up the struggle with all the strength they could muster. Patriotic groups soon sprang up throughout the length and breadth of the Archipelago. At first eluding the enemy, the guerrillas took to the mountains, but with the active support of the civilian population they quickly grew in number and strength to become a virtual challenge to the enemy. The story of the guerrilleros and of the civilian patriots who helped them, is an epic of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice. As far as possible they should be given recognition. Recognized guerrilla units have already been incorporated into the Philippine Army.\r\nAs stated in Leyte, in praising the guerrillas we should not be forgetful of the loyal civilians who were left behind and, at the risk of their lives, supported the resistance movement. Included among these civilians were those who, at the beginning of the war, were civil service employees or holders of subordinate positions in the government, and who remained at their posts to protect the people and extend to them all possible aid and comfort. They should, as a general principle, be recalled as soon as their services should be needed; only for strong reasons should they be deprived of their privilege to serve. This policy applies as well to elected provincial and municipal officials who were chosen in the election of 1940, thus giving due consideration to the will of the people as expressed at the polls.\r\nFilipino loyalty to America is an incontestable fact. It is the more remarkable when we consider that right from the start of the war the Filipinos were subjected to a terrific barrage of anti-American propaganda. Claiming invincibility and professing a brotherly spirit toward the Philippines, Japan declared that she had come to our country to free us from the American yoke, and offered us a place of honor in here much vaunted Co-Prosperity Sphere. But we contrasted these soothing words with the factual, liberal and generous record of America. Against the obviously empty promises of Tojo was the solemn pledge of President Roosevelt to the Filipinos that \u201ctheir freedom would be redeemed and their independence established and protected.\u201d This pledge was later enlarged to include the promise that the Philippines would be \u201cassisted in the full repair of the ravages caused by the war.\u201d\r\nIt was in quest of the fulfillment of the promises of President Roosevelt that President Quezon and his Cabinet accepted his invitation to transfer the Commonwealth Government to Washington. In the course of this session, I shall have occasion to report to you the activities of our government in the United States. In this message I propose to discuss only the salient phases of that labor.\r\nWhen we reached the United States, this country was entirely preoccupied with the problems of her mighty war effort and her attention was concentrated on the European front. She was straining all her means and resources towards the fulfillment of her resolution to crush Nazi Germany first. It was then extremely difficult to divert American attention to the Pacific, but determined to present our cause before the American people, President Quezon held conferences with President Roosevelt and appeared before the Senate and House of Representatives. In spite of the delicate state of his health, he worked ceaselessly during the first year of his stay in Washington, delivering important speeches and repeatedly broadcasting to the Philippines in an effort to maintain the faith of his people. In active support of the President, the members of his Cabinet also made speeches throughout the United States, inviting the attention of the people of America to the loyal stand of the Filipinos and urging prompt efforts for their early redemption.\r\nThe United States has kept her pledge. The Philippines is now liberated. This arduous campaign of eight months, beginning at Leyte Gulf, has ended with the current final phase of mopping up in Mindanao and Northern Luzon. Only the mountain corridor of Cagayan Valley, a trap from which there is no escape, remains under Japanese occupation.\r\nYet, in the flush of victory, we are apt to take for granted the monumental effort which the United States has had to exert to liberate us. Into the Southwest Pacific Area the Japanese General Staff had poured a tremendous amount of troops, planes and ships. Estimates place the Japanese, military forces in the Philippines as comprising an entire army area, two army corps, at least 22 divisions and brigades, and a large number of service troops, totaling at least 450,000 men. Merchant marine, laborers and hastily drafted civilians swelled this locust plague of armed of occupation forces.\r\nEnormous distances had to be traversed, but within the framework of a master plan that took everything into consideration\u2014climate, terrain and an enemy who preferred suicide to capture\u2014operations stretching over 3,000 miles were relentlessly pursued throughout the bitter years of 1942, 1943 and 1944, until the brilliant goal is within inescapable reach in 1945. The main goal of these far-flung operations was the liberation of the Philippines. Enemy losses in the Philippines to date exceed 380,000, a mortal wound inflicted on the Japanese army. With relatively low losses to ourselves, we have before us another example of the brilliant strategy of that genial military leader, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.\r\nThe strategic effect of the liberation of the Philippines has been to set the stage for ultimate Japanese defeat at home and in the south, two areas now severed from each other. Filipinos have done their part in this work by giving lavishly of their men and resources to the United States. But the fight is not yet over, and so I have offered to General MacArthur one division of Filipino troops, under Filipino officers, for the final assault on Japan. Words alone cannot express our gratitude to the United States for all it has done for us, and I take this opportunity to repeat the offer made by President Quezon in 1941 to the people of America\u2014that the men and resources of the Philippines are unconditionally at the service of the United States.\r\nWhile our Government in Washington did its utmost to present before the American people the political aspect of the struggle in the Philippines, it did not neglect the economic phase, fully aware that the war would produce serious dislocations in the economic life of our country. President Quezon initiated personally the negotiations with the Federal Government to obtain the necessary economic assistance after the war. He did not stop negotiating directly with that Government until, because of his health, he had to retire temporarily from active labor. To proceed with the work already commenced, he created a Post War Planning Board. This Board held sessions continuously and completed its preliminary work. This served as the basis for a program which was finally submitted by the representatives of our Government on the Filipino Rehabilitation Commission presided over by Senator Tydings. I am presenting to you with this message the reports which have been submitted to me by the Filipino group of this Commission. Upon their examination you will find that the program of relief and rehabilitation, as prepared by our representatives in Washington, is very comprehensive. I wish on this occasion to praise the work done by our group. Our men there accomplished a difficult task within very limited means. Now that there is available to me a wealth of human material, it is my purpose to appoint to this Commission new representatives, among whom will be members of this Congress.\r\nWhen I assumed office as President of the Philippines, I considered it my duty to exert every possible effort to obtain the active personal interest of the President of the United States in our problems. But when I was prepared to confer with President Roosevelt on his return from Quebec last October, I received an urgent request from General MacArthur, to join him and the forces of liberation that were poised to retake the Philippines. Because of this urgent request, I was able to have only a short conference with President Roosevelt, but I promised him that I would return to the United States as soon as possible to continue our conversations.\r\nAfter the reestablishment of the Commonwealth Government in Leyte, I returned to the United States. President Roosevelt being then out of Washington and, on the other hand, finding myself in urgent need of submitting to a physical examination, I went to Jacksonville, Florida. Everything was in readiness for my hospitalization there when I received another telegram from General Macarthur urging me to join him in Luzon immediately. Reaching Lingayen on the very day I was expected, I rejoined General MacArthur in his headquarters and with him I entered Manila.\r\nUpon resuming my functions in this Capital, I endeavored to convene the Congress, but due to the military situation, it was not possible to do so. I then decided to return to the United States to renew my conferences with President Roosevelt. We met on April 5th and reached an agreement on some of our basic problems. We further agreed to meet again in Washington. Unfortunately, the President died on the 12th.\r\nShocked by the sad news, I hastened to express to his successor the most profound condolences of the Filipino people. I flew to Washington to attend the funeral services. In the passing of President Roosevelt we, with the entire world, have suffered an irreparable loss. I recommend the erection, by public subscription, of a national library to be named \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Library\u201d as a lasting tribute to him who was a true friend of the Filipinos and a great champion of human rights and liberties.\r\nPresident Roosevelt had suggested that our next meeting be at the White House on April 19. On that date President Truman received me and we conferred in the presence of the Secretaries of State, War, Navy and the Interior. This was followed by another conference the next week in which President Truman accepted as his own President Roosevelt\u2019s commitments with respect to the Philippines and decided, with my concurrence, to send Senator Tydings of Maryland as his special envoy to the Philippines.\r\nThe object of the Tydings Mission was not to collect data here, since all the necessary statistical and other information were already available to Senator Tydings before he left Washington. The mission desired, firstly, to obtain a personal impression of the situation in which the war had left us, and secondly, to contact personally the officials of the Philippine Government, the Military Command and other interested parties, with a view to coordinating their suggestions and fitting them into the rehabilitation plans already under consideration. Deeply moved by what he saw in Manila, Senator Tydings decided to return immediately to Washington to report to the President of the United States. Indicative of the sympathy, zeal and industry of the Tydings Mission is the four-point program for the rehabilitation of the Philippines which it has publicly announced. I am confident that action on this and other programs will soon be forthcoming.\r\nFirst and foremost in our minds, as Filipinos, is the question of our political future. In this matter, no greater and nobler message has been given to the Filipino people than that of President Roosevelt when, on August 13, 1943, reiterating his previous promises on independence made on December 28, 1941, he expressed himself in the following words:\r\n\u201cOn December 28, 1941, three weeks after the armies of the Japanese launched their attack on Philippine soil, I sent a proclamation to you, the gallant people of the Philippines.\r\n\u201cI said then:\r\n\u201c\u2019I give to the people of the Philippines my solemn pledge that their freedom will be redeemed and their independence established and protected. The entire resources in men and materials of the United States stand behind that pledge.\u2019\r\n\u201cWe shall keep this promise just as we have kept every promise which America has made to the Filipino people.\u201d\r\nSoon after, on the initiative of President Quezon, steps were taken to obtain congressional sanction for these pledges. If President Quezon did nothing but this in his political career \u2014 and his political record can hardly be surpassed \u2014 it alone would entitle him to the eternal gratitude of his people. Senate Joint Resolution No. 93, which President Quezon and I asked for and accepted, is the culmination of our joint congressional efforts. This legislation authorizes the President of the United States to advance the date of independence provided in the Independence Law. It also provides, through the maintenance by the United States of bases in the Philippines, \u201cfor full security for the Philippines, for the mutual protection of the Islands and the United States, and for the future maintenance of peace in the Pacific.\u201d\r\nSo that the import of this new legislation, and the responsibility which we Filipinos have assumed thereby, may be better understood, it is necessary that we review past events even if we have to walk again on well-trodden paths.\r\nNational independence was the goal which our revolutionaries of 1896 and 1898 set for themselves. When the fortunes of war were adverse to our arms and American sovereignty was established in 1898, individual liberties were recognized, among them the right of free assembly. Under the protection of this freedom, two political groups came into existence: the Federalistas, who declared themselves in favor of the annexation of the Philippines to the United States so as to constitute, in due time, a state of the Union; and the Nacionalistas, who advocated the ideal of independence which the Filipino revolutionaries had proclaimed but were not able to achieve in war.\r\nThe aspiration to be free, nurtured in an atmosphere of peace, was received with sympathy in the United States. The legitimacy of this aspiration was recognized by Dr. Jacob G. Schurman, President of the first American Commission sent by President McKinley to the Philippines, in these memorable words:\r\n\u201cThe watchword of progress, the key to the future of the political development of the archipelago, is neither colonialism nor federalism, but nationalism. The destiny of the Philippine Islands is not to be a State or territory in the United States of America, but a daughter republic of ours\u2014a new birth of liberty on the, other side of the Pacific, which shall animate and energize those lovely islands of the tropical seas, and, rearing its head aloft, stand as a monument of progress and a beacon of hope to all the oppressed and benighted millions of the Asiatic continent.\u201d\r\nOn their part the Filipino people, who had elected a majority of Nacionalistas to the first Philippine Assembly, which met in 1907, repeatedly reiterated their confidence in them in successive elections, until the Congress approved in 1934 the Tydings-McDuffie Act creating the present Commonwealth. This law was accepted, first by the Legislature and then directly by the people, thus binding America and the Philippines to a virtual covenant by which the United States formally committed itself to withdraw its sovereignty from the Philippines and proclaim our independence on July 4, 1946. The ten-year transition period was not established to delay the proclamation of independence, but only to prepare the Philippines adequately for the responsibilities of nationhood.\r\nWe were well advanced in our preparations for independence when we became the object of an unjust aggression by Japan. But Japan\u2019s military occupation of the Philippines had not affected the independence program agreed upon between the United States and the Philippines. When President Roosevelt invited the President of the Government of the Commonwealth and his Cabinet to evacuate to the United States, he did not do so merely to preserve the constitutional integrity of the Philippine Government but also to assure the realization, in due time, of the program of independence.\r\nWith this fundamental idea in mind, the United States took the initiative of considering the Philippines as possessing all of the attributes of complete and respected nationhood. I cannot give you a more authoritative statement concerning the status of our Government in Washington than that which President Roosevelt himself made in his broadcast to the Philippines on August 13, 1943:\r\n\u201cThe Philippine Government is a signatory of the Declaration by the United Nations, along with thirty-one other nations. President Quezon and Vice President Osme\u00f1a attend the meetings of the Pacific War Council, where the war in the Pacific is charted and planned. Your government has participated fully and equally in the United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, and a Philippine representative is a member of the Interim Commission created by that Conference. And, of course, the Philippine Government will have its rightful place in the conference which will follow the defeat of Japan.\u201d\r\nIn confirmation of this status we are now participating, among the free and independent nations of the world, in the United Nations Conference on International Organization now taking place in San Francisco.\r\nThis war, which has ravaged the world and which is yet to be won in the Pacific, has brought to the Philippines a permanent blessing. I refer to the fundamental change in America\u2019s policy with regard to the outside world, namely, her abandonment of the attitude of isolation and her frank acknowledgment of her duty, as one of the most powerful nations on earth, to preserve for all mankind liberty, justice, peace and security.\r\nIn conformity with this new, well-asserted ideology, Congress approved in 1944 Joint Resolutions 93 and 94 which provide, among other things, for the permanent security of the Philippines. America will not only acknowledge our independence as soon as it is possible after the Japanese have been expelled from our soil but will provide, besides, protection for that independence.\r\nWhen the Philippine Assembly in 1907 formulated the first official petition of the Filipino people that it be granted independence, it did so fully aware of the responsibilities which the new status would impose on us with respect to our security. The Jones Law of 1916 offered us independence as soon as we had organized a stable government, and we accepted it in spite of the fact that such a law did not contain any promise giving us the protection of America after the attainment of our political freedom. In 1934 the Filipino people had occasion in a plebiscite to accept or reject an independence law without adequate American guarantee for its maintenance. The people accepted the offer by an overwhelming majority. With America now offering us protection which assures the permanency of our independence, it would be inconceivable for any Filipino to vacillate.\r\nThe program of independence, initially written with the blood of the heroes and martyrs of our history, which took root in the days of the first Philippine Assembly in 1907, which acquired consistency throughout the long period of Filipino-American collaboration resulting in the approval of the Jones Law in 1916 and the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1935, is a program definitely accepted by the Filipino people. Those of us who are temporarily in charge of the affairs of state are mere trustees of the sacred ideal of our people. We have no right to turn back\u2014we shall not turn back\u2014cowed by imaginary dangers or swayed by the desire to lead a life of ease and plenty. We cannot sell our liberty for a mess of pottage.\r\nWhen Andres Bonifacio and his men uttered their now historic First Cry of Balintawak, they were not held back by fear of the enemy, or by any love of earthly goods. When we took over the banner of liberty from those that fell in the night of our defeat, we asked only for freedom and for nothing more. When we were asked in 1934 if we preferred liberty to prosperity, our people answered overwhelmingly that they desired liberty above everything else. Now that the United States, in recognition of our role in this war, has declared itself our ally and, with liberty, offers us security, it is our duty and our choice to accept.\r\nSo I say to every Filipino and to all other elements in our state, that the die is cast. Our course is straight and inflexible. We are going forward to the achievement of our national aspiration.\r\nGentlemen of the Congress: You are gathered today under the most trying circumstances. There are many serious problems ahead of us. But we who have so long and ardently clamored for self-government must prove to the world that we are equal to the most exacting tasks of public administration. That great and distinguished friend of the Filipino people, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, once said that they are only fit to live who are not afraid to die. Our people have shown on the battlefield that they are not afraid to die.\r\nBut the tasks of peace are at times more exacting than those of war. We are administering the affairs of eighteen million people just delivered from three long years of enslavement. To them we owe justice, order and the means to live in contentment and happiness. I am aware that our means at the moment are inadequate. We are not able to provide our people with as much as they deserve. But we shall not falter in the line of duty.\r\nLet us get together in one mighty effort. Let us set aside selfish considerations and forget petty differences. Only in unity can there be strength. To the experienced, I turn for advice. From the youth of the land, I ask for its enthusiasm and energies. My faith in our people is unbounded. Over the ruins of our cities and barrios we shall build anew. In this most crucial hour of our history, I look forward to our destiny unafraid, confident that, God willing, ours will be a happy, progressive and prosperous land.\r\nIn closing, permit me to congratulate you most heartily for being the first elective Congress to meet in a country liberated from the enemy, although the Philippines is among the last to be free from enemy occupation and control.\r\nI wish you all success in discharging the tremendous responsibility that is yours during the present emergency.\r\n:\r\nOsme\u00f1a, S. (1945).\r\n. Manila : Bureau of Printing.", "title": "Message to the First Congress of the Commonwealth of Philippines"},
{"delivered": "1940-01-22 12:21:32+00:00", "author": "Manuel L. Quezon", "text": "[Delivered at the Opening of the Second Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 22, 1940]\r\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\r\nYou are convened at a time when many countries of the world are in the throes of war. The agonies which the nations involved in the conflict are suffering can\u00adnot but touch our hearts deeply. We sympathize with their sad fate and we pray to God that the tragic ordeal may soon come to an end. No nation, however far removed from the struggle, can escape its disturbing effects. Even we are experiencing the inevitable consequences of this war in the way of reduced trade with the warring nations and their neighbors, in\u00adcreased transportation and insurance rates, depressed prices for export commodities, and other intangible effects which result from a stoppage or a drastic limi\u00adtation of world trade. Withal, we are fortunate that we are at peace and that it is the policy of the United States to stay out of the war. With that policy we are in full accord.\r\nThe United States Congress, in its last session, passed a neutrality law defining the obligations of the United a States towards the belligerent nations and prescribing, limitations upon commercial intercourse between them and the peoples living under the American flag. The Philippines is bound by that Neutrality Act, and our Government and people are fully cooperating with the United States Government in its strict enforcement. It is our good fortune to have in these very critical times, His Excellency, Francis B. Sayre, as United States High Commissioner to the Philippines. He is a scholar, a diplomat and a statesman. [Applause.] During the last three years he has been engaged in the study and consideration of our problems as Chairman of the United States Inter-Departmental Committee and of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs. No one has labored more than he did in securing the approval by the Congress of the United States of the Economic Adjustment Act. He merits our gratitude for that signal service.\r\nAll the requirements prescribed by Congress for the effectiveness of the Economic Adjustment Act have been fulfilled. The Act, therefore, is now in full effect and all the agencies necessary for its en\u00adforcement have been set up. The quotas for different products provided in the Act have been allocated. It is my purpose to submit to you at an early date a definite proposal to permit the Government to lay the groundwork for the economic conference that is to be held at least, two years before the establishment of the Philippine Republic.\r\nIn your last special session, you approved laws to protect the people against profiteering during these war times, and to insure for the country a steady and sufficient supply of prime necessities and the continued operation of farms and factories. To accomplish the first aim, maximum prices for the most important commodities have been fixed and are being enforced. To attain the second purpose, the National Trading Corporation with a capital stock of P5,000,000 has been organized. A detailed report on these matters will be submitted to the National Assembly as required by law.\r\nPursuant to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 453, I have effected a reorganization of the De\u00adpartments of the Interior, Agriculture and Commerce, and Labor. The National Information Board was abolished as a separate entity and converted into a division of the Department of the Interior. The activities of the various bureaus and offices under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce were properly coordinated, thus avoiding the overlapping of functions. The Bureau of Labor was abolished, and its work distributed among the various divisions of the Department, performing identical functions. The Division of Immigration was reorganized and its personnel increased with funds appropriated under Commonwealth Act No. 501.\r\nWe are making progress, however slowly, in our determination to raise the masses of our people to a position of relative ease. But our task is an ex\u00adtremely difficult one. Capital in the Philippines does not as yet seem to fully realize its obligations to labor and to society, and it will be necessary for you to enact after due investigation further labor legislations that will secure for the underpaid laborers higher wages and better living conditions, especially in the mining and sugar industries. [Applause.].\r\nI regret that there are some labor leaders who insist upon resorting to strikes as the proper and best means of obtaining recognition of labor rights. Where, as in the Philippines today, the Government is earnestly endeavoring to help labor in its just claims, strikes are unnecessary and unjustified. Although the right to strike is recognized by law, strikes are, by their nature, a form of coercion, and once coercion is used by one party in, a conflict, it pro\u00advokes retaliation by the other party. Hence, strikes often result in physical violence, sabotage, and public disorder. When such a situation arises, the Gov\u00adernment is compelled to intervene, and when the Government intervenes to suppress violence and restore public order, it has to act swiftly under circumstances that often inflict loss or injury upon in\u00adnocent parties.\r\nMoreover, experience shows that the cost of strikes both to capital and labor in terms of financial losses, physical and moral suffering, and otherwise is enor\u00admous. Such loss, directly or indirectly, is shared by the whole community. Strikes should not, therefore, be used except as a last resort, for the settlement of industrial and agrarian disputes or for securing recognition of the rights of labor. Arbitration or adjudication by the Court of Industrial Relations has been found to be less wasteful and more expedient procedure for securing substantial justice. In any event, when a strike is declared, the use of violence or sabotage, by either side, will not be countenanced by the Government.\r\nOur policy to acquire large haciendas with a view to their sale in small parcels to the peasants who work them and to purchase urban land to provide homes for the poor on easy terms is being effectuated. But here again we are met with serious difficulties in some instances, coming either from selfish and greedy land\u00adowners or from irresponsible and dishonest agitators. In the Hacienda de Buenavista in Bulacan, for a long time a focus of unrest and disturbances, some of the tenants who have been made to believe that they could become the owners of the land without paying fur it, are as yet not fully convinced that they have been deceived, and instead of welcoming the help of the Government, are either refusing to agree to the plan devised for the ultimate transfer to them of their landholdings, or in some other way trying to frustrate the plan. The management of the Hacienda, although carrying out the plan with firm determination, is showing extreme patience, because it is believed that these misguided people will sooner or later realize that we are seeking only their best interests and will then lend their full cooperation to the plan.\r\nThe Government has already purchased large parcels of land for homesites in Marikina, Rizal; San Pedro Tunasan, Laguna; and Dinalupihan, Bataan. Steps are being taken to expropriate the homesites in Malabon, Rizal. These purchases comprise lands owned by some corporations where people in large numbers have built their houses. We are trying to free these communities from the grip of absentee landlordism and to help them become owners of their homes, under terms and conditions that they can bear.\r\nIt is in the City of Manila where we are confronted with the most serious situation. Here the largest number of industrial workers live. Here, too, unem\u00adployment is at its worst. Individuals with no stable occupation but who can find work only occasionally, abound. The result is that in several sections of the city\u2014Intramuros, Tondo, Sampaloc\u2014there are many slums where the poor live under conditions totally unfit for human beings, crowded together in small quarters without sufficient ventilation or sanitary facilities.\r\nIn an effort to relieve Manila of a part of its congested population that can conveniently go to live in Quezon City, we have purchased a large parcel of land, known as the Hacienda de Diliman, with an area of about 1,600 hectares. The plan is to offer to government officials, especially the small salaried employees and laborers, for sale or rent, lots where they can build, or have the Government build, their homes. In the subdivision of this land there will be portions which may be acquired by private individuals, both the rich and those of moderate means. There will also be sections set aside for industrial establishments. This project which we have placed under a most capable management, at no cost to the Government, is in process of execu\u00adtion. Roads are being constructed and lots subdi\u00advided; model houses are being built and in due time the lots and the houses will be ready for sale. But this project cannot by any means solve the problem of the slums, nor provide decent homes for all line poor living in the City of Manila and its vicinity. In the first place, Diliman is too far for those laborers who work in or around Intramuros and Tondo. In the second place, if all the people residing in the overcrowded districts were to go to Diliman, there would not be sufficient room for them. From the reclaimed area in the North Fort, fifty hectares or 500,000 square meters will be reserved for the fishermen of Tondo, Pasay, and Baclaran, as well as for laborers in the water-front. But even with this plan, which will be in the course of execution next year, we shall not be able completely to do away with the slums or to have all the residents of this city live under proper sanitary conditions.\r\nWe must expropriate more land. Fortunately, there is more than enough unoccupied land within the radius of the city itself and its immediate sur\u00adroundings that can be used for this purpose. But the prices of these lands have been unjustly boosted by their owners. The increase of population and the public improvements made by the Government are being taken advantage of by these land profiteers to exploit the public. These lands have been held unimproved all these many years. Their owners have valued them for purposes of taxation at incomprehensively low prices, and now for lands that are assessed at four centavos per square meter, the owners are exacting from the Government or private indi\u00adviduals a price of three, four and even more pesos per square meter. This should not be tolerated.\r\nWhile it is our purpose to maintain inviolate the right, of private property, we must not pay more than what is just compensation therefore, taking into con\u00adsideration the value at which the property has been assessed upon the owner\u2019s own declaration or with his consent. I recommend, therefore, that the Assessment Law be amended by providing that whenever an as\u00adsessment is made for the purpose of imposing the real properly tax and the same is not protested by the owner thereof, within a specified period after receiving notice of the assessment, said owner will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the valuation as the just and fair value of his property, and that, in case of expropriation proceedings by the Government or its instrumentalities, the assessment shall be taken as prima facie evidence of the value of the property. I likewise desire to submit to your consideration the need of imposing special assessment tax upon real property that have greatly appreciated in value as a result of the construction by the National Government of roads or other public improvements. The owners of such properties have no right to enjoy the extra\u00adordinary rise in value or the increase in the income, without contributing proportionately to the cost of said improvements.\r\nThere are many cases involving the ejectment of poor people who have built small houses on unim\u00adproved lands with the consent of the owners thereof. Because of the construction of public improvements, the value of these lands has risen suddenly and the owners are demanding prices which are far beyond the ability of their tenants to pay. It is cruel to permit the ejection of these poor people and to have their houses destroyed, thus leaving them without shelter. The National Assembly should consider the advisability of amending the existing law regulating ejectment proceedings so as to protect such tenants by pro\u00adhibiting their ejectment until the Government has had opportunity to take care of them.\r\nUnemployment continues to be one of the main problems of the Government, and that problem, in all likelihood, will confront us for some time to come. For the purpose of assisting the Secretary of Labor in the study of this matter, I have created an Advisory Board on Unemployment; and, as an aid to the solu\u00adtion of the problem, or at least to prevent its aggra\u00advation, I recommend the enactment of immigration laws that will place limitations upon foreign immigration thus protecting Filipino labor from alien competition. We should, however, do away with the existing discrimination against Orientals, it being unjust and unfair to close our door to races which are akin to ours.\r\nThe fiscal operations of the Government during the past year have been satisfactory. Revenues have exceeded ordinary expenditures during the last fiscal period by P6,928,977.45, although this excess and a part of the accumulated surplus were used to cover extraordinary or nonrecurring expenses amounting to P23,927,909.43. Actual collections exceeded budgetary estimates in the amount of P5,323,573.66. The condition of the excise tax fund will be reported to you in a separate message. The public debt has been reduced as required by law and is now only P79,582,982.84, as compared to P95,076,798.27 in 1935. This public debt will be more than amply covered from the proceeds of export taxes provided in the Independence Act, accruing before 1946. In addition to this public debt, however, the Manila Railroad Company has an outstanding obligation in the amount of P26,472,000 for which no sinking funds are being provided. In order to protect the credit of one of our most im\u00adportant enterprises, the Government will have to as\u00adsume the payment of this debt maturing in 1956. I recommend that the National Assembly consider a plan establishing a sinking fund for these obliga\u00adtions from the proceeds of the excise tax in the event the Manila Railroad Company is unable to provide therefore.\r\nThe business corporations of the Government have been operated efficiently and in the public interest. While the National Food Products Corporation is still operating at a loss, the Cebu Portland Cement Company, the Insular Refining Company, the Manila Port Terminal, and the National Bank have ail made substantial profits during the past year. The National Development Company has also made a profit from its own operations as well as from its operations as a holding company.\r\nThe Agricultural and Industrial Bank has been organized and is now in operation. The main purpose of this bank is to help agriculture and industry, chiefly in the establishment of new industries, the production of new crops and the extension of cultivation and diversification of products in farm areas.\r\nThe National Power Corporation has decided to undertake the development of the Caliraya water project. The construction of this project is under way. The bonds issued by the corporation to finance this enterprise were oversubscribed.\r\nThe exploration of our oil resources is being pushed forward as rapidly as possible and within a few months the geological survey will be completed. As soon as the result of the survey is available, it will be time to decide whether drilling operations should be under\u00adtaken by the Government or by responsible private companies.\r\nThe Government has been giving impetus to the organization of cooperatives for consumers, producers, and small merchants to eliminate middlemen and need\u00adless entrepreneurs. This form of economic organiza\u00adtion has been successful in other countries, and I can see no reason why it will not meet with the same success in the Philippines. It will probably take time to educate our people on the value of cooperative effort, with the discipline and intelligent collaboration required by that method of economic endeavor. We have to contend with the apathy prevailing in cer\u00adtain groups as well as with old practices and tradi\u00adtions which are both uneconomic and otherwise unde\u00adsirable. But I have faith that these difficulties will be overcome. The successful operation of these co\u00adoperatives will aid in a great measure in the solution of our economic problems and in the ultimate stab\u00adilization of our national economy.\r\nRetailers\u2019 cooperatives are being organized in Ma\u00adnila and in the provinces. The Buenavista Coopera\u00adtive is in operation. The shoemakers of Marikina and neighboring municipalities have likewise been organized into a cooperative association to permit them to own and operate the industry themselves. It is my opinion that the same thing might be done with regard to hat-makers. The Hemp Corporation is undertaking the organization of cooperatives among hemp producers. The same thing will be done with respect to coconut producers.\r\nThe coconut industry has long been suffering from depressed prices. This is partly due to inefficient methods of curing copra, lack of credit facilities, and faulty system of marketing. It is also attributable to the failure to utilize the by-products of the coconut. In view of the authorization granted in the Economic Adjustment Act, permitting the use of this excise tax on coconut oil for the purpose of improving the curing of copra and the granting of crop loans to coconut producers, I recommend that the National Assembly pass a law allowing the organization of a corporation for these purposes. [Applause.]\r\nThe tobacco industry is going through a most critical period; booth in the factories and in the fields. Prices for leaf tobacco are even now not sufficient to insure reasonable returns to farmers, and with the gradual loss of foreign markets, the situation will aggravate. Cigar makers are suffering from low wages, partly because we have not been able to find enough markets for our high-priced cigars.\r\nThe Government is undertaking a serious study looking to a solution of the problems confronting this industry, and I recommend that you consider the advisability of authorizing the creation of a tobacco corporation that will provide credit to farmers, aid in the proper curing of leaf tobacco, improve the quality of tobacco and cigars, and stimulate the production of cigarette tobacco. This corporation, when organized, could take over the duties assigned to the To\u00adbacco Board in the investment and disposition of the funds collected from inspection fees. The Warehousing Corporation has under construc\u00adtion eleven warehouses for rice, copra, hemp, and tobacco, and others are being planned. The purpose of these warehouses is to provide storing facilities for producers, meantime permitting them to obtain credit on the security of their crops.\r\nThe Koronadal land settlement project in Mindanao has been started. There are now approximately 2,000 men in that territory. More are going at the rate of 250 every month. An irrigation system has been built and experiments have been conducted covering dif\u00adferent crops. The results thus far have been most encouraging, and the program for this year is to place, under cultivation in that area, no less than 3,009 hec\u00adtares. Everything is being done to safeguard the health and well-being of the settlers.\r\nI wish to invite attention to the economic adjustment projects recommended in the report of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs. Some of these projects are in process of execution; others are still in an experimental stage or under study. In order to properly carry out the plan to promote new crops and greater diversification of products, it is necessary, as recommended by the Joint Preparatory Committee, that we establish, as soon as possible, adequate agricultural, experimental and demonstration stations. The existing stations, maintained entirely with funds contributed by provinces and municipalities, are inade\u00adquate. It is not possible to conduct experiments in so many stations which are insufficiently financed. Moreover, the necessary trained men for the opera\u00adtions of these stations are not available. I recommend that the National Government assume full respon\u00adsibility of establishing and operating experimental and demonstration stations in carefully selected places in order that the experiments and demonstrations may be conducted on a more scientific and systematic basis.\r\nClosely allied with the problem of economic ad\u00adjustment is the question of scientific research. I de\u00adsire to reiterate my recommendation in a previous message to the National Assembly to consolidate all the agencies of the Government engaged in scientific research into one scientific research institute, using the Bureau of Science as a nucleus for the purpose. The expenses for its operation may be covered with the funds appropriated for the Bureau of Science and the other agencies of the Government dealing in re\u00adsearch. This project has been strongly recommended both by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and by the National Economic Council in view of the report submitted by Dr. Raymond Bacon who was employed by the Government to study this matter.\r\nIt is necessary to expand the activities of the Bureau of Commerce to enable it to cope with the increasing demands of our growing trade. Division for the promotion of exports and for the stimulation of local trade should be organized in that bureau. To protect the rights of inventors and manufacturers, a patent office should be established.\r\nOne of the most important but neglected industries is our fishing industry. To enable the Government effectively to promote this industry and to exercise the necessary supervision and control over the same, I propose the conversion of the present Fish and Game Administration Division into a bureau under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to emphasize the importance of organizing an office to collect and compile statis\u00adtical data for the use of the Government and the public. The Census Commission, after it has completed its work, should be converted into a per\u00admanent bureau to render that service.\r\nMany public improvements authorized by the Na\u00adtional Assembly were accomplished during the year that has just ended. First-class roads were increased by 208 kilometers, second-class roads by 878 kilometers, and third-class roads by 854 kilo\u00admeters, thus making a total of 21,166.1 kilometers for all classes of roads, of which 10,310.4 are national roads and 10,805,7 provincial roads. Many public buildings were erected, including 386 school houses.\r\nOur system of transportation has been greatly improved and extended. The railroad to the Bicol prov\u00adinces has been completed and opened to traffic. Many bridges and port facilities have been built, and new boats have been added to the coastwise and interisland shipping. The number of ships under Philippine reg\u00adistry engaged in overseas trade has increased, and three new ocean-going steamers are now in the service. This fact should be a source of satisfaction and benefit for our country, not only because it will permit the carrying of the Filipino flag to distant lands, but also because it will help in insuring sufficient bottoms to carry our exports to foreign markets, particularly during the present emergency. The Government, however, is not contemplating the acquisition or operation at least during the next few years, of ocean-going steamers.\r\nThe Department of National Defense, created by Commonwealth Act No. 432, was organized, effective November 1, 1939. This new department has execu\u00adtive supervision over the Philippine Army, the Bureau of Aeronautics, the Bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Philippine Nautical School and over the establishment and operation of all radio stations other than those maintained by the Bureau of Posts. As the appropriation used by this new Department for the current fiscal year was taken from the forced savings in salaries and wages and sundry expenses of bureaus and offices under the Office of the President, it is recommended that adequate appropriation be provided for this Department for the coming fiscal year.\r\nThere are at present 363 officers and 3,735 men in the regular army and 4,829 officers and 104,412 men in the reserve. This shows that the youth of the land have responded patriotically to the call of duty and indicates how much has been accomplished in the execution of the National Defense Program.\r\nSubstantial progress is being made in public sanitation and in providing the poor with medical service. But there are still a number of provinces that do not count with proper hospital facilities. With the aid of the National Government, a more generalized pro\u00adgram of hospital construction is being gradually carried out.\r\nMore funds should be appropriated for the care and protection of the under-privileged\u2014the aged and infirm, the dependent and the destitute, as well as the neglected and the delinquent, the physically and the mentally handicapped children.\r\nThe extension of opportunities for public educa\u00adtion to all children of school age continues to be one of the major problems of the Government. De\u00adspite the opening of 3,600 extension classes and the construction of new buildings, there are still many children of school age out of school. The difficulty of the problem lies not so much in the shortage of funds as in the insufficiency of professionally-trained teachers. I have appointed a Joint Educational Sur\u00advey Committee for the purpose of studying and rec\u00adommending a solution for the recurring school crisis.\r\nGreater importance is being given to character and civic education and the fostering of patriotism among the children and the youth. For this purpose, a code of citizenship and ethics has been promulgated and courses of study on character and civic education are being revised.\r\nThere is a growing popular response to the work of the Office of Adult Education as shown by the fact that there are How over 4,000 schools for adult citizens.\r\nThe survey conducted by the Board of Regents with the advice of two outstanding educators from the United States on the needs and problems of the University of the Philippines has been completed, and many of the recommendations are being put into effect. The transfer of the institution to the new site in Quezon City will proceed as rapidly as cir\u00adcumstances will permit.\r\nIn order to meet the need of our industries for technological service, it is advisable that we increase the number of government scholarships abroad. From the appropriation at our disposal, we are able to grant only twenty scholarships every year. The better to carry out our program of economic development, this number should be increased.\r\nFor the first time in our judicial history the Su\u00adpreme Court has brought its docket up to date, while the Court of Appeals is fast moving to clear its own calendar of cases. The Supreme Court has not only decided many important questions but also enun\u00adciated constitutional doctrines that have far-reaching effect. In addition to this noteworthy accomplishment, the Court has recently promulgated the Rules of Court, which constitutes a revision of our procedural laws designed to expedite litigation and to render less expensive but more efficient the administration of justice.\r\nAs a consequence of the enactment of Common\u00adwealth Act No. 177, carrying out the Constitutional mandate to extend the merit system to all branches and subdivisions of the Government, the selection of employees, not only in the national but also in the local governments, has been based on the merit sys\u00adtem and practically all government employees are new in the classified civil service. All positions in the Government have been classified and salaries standardized as required by the Salary Law.\r\nThe volume of work in the Office of our Resident Commissioner at Washington is continually increasing as a result of the supervision of that Office of the various interests and activities of the Commonwealth Government in the United States. Whereas in the past the work of the Resident Commissioner was lim\u00adited to his congressional duties, it has become nec\u00adessary since the establishment of the Commonwealth to entrust him with other duties as the representative of our Government in America. He has to supervise the work of the insular purchasing agent and the tobacco agent, take charge of matters relative to government pensionados, disseminate accurate information about the Philippines, promote Philippine trade, and look after the interests of Filipinos residing in the United States and territories. It is recommended that the appropriation for the Office of the Resident Commissioner be increased sufficiently to enable it to discharge efficiently these new duties and responsibil\u00adities.\r\nThe provinces, cities, and municipalities have maintained a sound financial position. The revenue laws recently passed by the National Assembly will increase their income by approximately P10,000,000 which will be twice as much as they used to receive from the cedula tax. The municipalities, however, are meeting Serious difficulties m balancing their school budget. The total estimated deficit of municipalities for current expenditures in the school fund is around P500,000. This deficit could be met by the repeal of the pro\u00advision of the new Real Property Assessment Law reducing to 50 per cent the valuation of coconut, hemp and other similar improvements. There is no justification for such a provision, considering that there is now being undertaken a revision of prop\u00aderty values which is the best means for a proper assessment. This conclusion becomes more evident when it is considered that some provinces have only recently reduced the assessment of such improve\u00adments adjusting it to present conditions, as in the case of the Provinces of Tayabas and Laguna. I urgently recommend that the National Assembly take early action repealing that provision.\r\nOn September 15, 1939, the National Assembly adopted a resolution proposing important amendments to the Constitution. I refer to the amendments es\u00adtablishing a bicameral legislature, changing the tenure of office of the President and the Vice-President, creating an independent Commission on Elections, and fixing a compensation for Senators and Representatives higher than that now received by the members of the National Assembly. By Commonwealth Act No. 492, it is provided that these amendments shall he submitted to the people for their ratification at the next general election for local officials. After hearing the views of provincial and municipal officials and the members of the Council of State, as well as other persons who have no partisan interest, I deem it my duty to recommend that the law be amended so as to authorize the holding of a plebiscite on these amendments on a date different from that fixed for the election of provincial and municipal officials. While this may entail more expenses for the Government, I believe that the change is imperative from the stand\u00adpoint of public interest.\r\nThe proposed constitutional amendments are in effect a revision of the present Constitution, and the resolution proposing the same clearly contemplates that they should be submitted to the people in an integrated form. The amendments so affect the entire document and in this sense are so interrelated as to preclude any manner of having them voted upon separately or severally.\r\nThe importance of these amendments requires that they be submitted to the people for ratification or re\u00adjection squarely and without the introduction of extraneous and irrelevant issues, and this would be impossible if the plebiscite were held on the same date as that set for the next regular election of local officers. The proposed amendments affect only the national Government and should be acted upon by the voters independently of local political interests or considerations.\r\nThe conquest and subjugation of formerly independent nations, the invasion by strong powers of insufficiently defended territories, the not infrequent disregard of international covenants and laws have of late caused great anxiety in the minds of many people both in the United States and in the Philippines, and not a few of them are raising the question whether it is the part of wisdom to carry out the plan already agreed upon of establishing the Philippine Republic in 1946.\r\nNo one can feel more keenly than I do the responsibility for the future of our people. The sacred duty of leading our Government through these first years of preparation for an independent national existence has fallen to my lot, and I have tried to discover by every means at my disposal if there be any compelling reason why the plan as decreed by the Congress of the United States and accepted by us should not be put through. I am of the opinion that the international situation has not developed to a point where anyone can predict what the fate of small nations will be in the years to come.\r\nIn the discussion of a possible change in the program of independence embodied in the Independence Act, it is important to bear in mind the following considerations:\r\nFirst. That the Government of the United States will not consider favorably any proposal merely to post\u00adpone the granting of independence beyond 1946, meanwhile continuing the present political and economic set-up in the relations between America and the Philippines.\r\nSecond. That if the Filipino people are unwilling or afraid to assume the responsibilities of independent nationhood by 1946, their only alternative is to petition Congress to declare the Philippines permanently as American territory.\r\nThird. That America will not assume the obligation to protect the independence and territorial in\u00adtegrity of the Philippines against foreign aggression.\r\nIn the face of these considerations, the question for us to decide is whether because of the uncertainty of the future of small nations, we should abandon the idea of becoming independent.\r\nI am unalterably opposed to the prolongation of the present political set-up beyond 1946 [Applause], because I believe that it is not conducive to our best interests. On the other hand, we cannot consider permanent political relationship with America except on the basis that the Philippines would at least have full and complete power over immigration, imports, exports, currency and related financial subjects, as well as the right to conclude commercial treaties with other nations, without being subjected to the super\u00advision and control of the United Slates. [Applause.] This, I am quite certain, is not feasible, considering the present state of public opinion in America.\r\nIt would be utopian to believe confidently that the Philippines would not be exposed to foreign aggres\u00adsion, once we cease to be under the protection of the American flag. But, if we want to have the untram\u00admeled right to govern ourselves as we think best for our own welfare, we must assume the responsibilities that go hand in hand with that right. [Applause.] That means that we shall have to depend upon our\u00adselves and take our chance exactly as every inde\u00adpendent nation had to do.\r\nWe hope for the best. We shall promote friendly relations with other nations and be mindful of their rights. We shall endeavor to protect and defend our national integrity and independence to the limit of our means. We know not what the future has in store for us, but we have faith in a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who alone holds our fate. [Applause.] We cannot falter in the at\u00adtainment of our long-cherished Ideal. We must secure a place, however modest, in the concert of free nations.

PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nI am happy to return to the halls in which I saw my start in national public life. I feel perfectly at home here. It has been my great privilege to preside over both the houses of Congress in years past. No one is more jealous than I have been and still am of the proud prerogatives of the Legislative branch of Government. You share with me the responsibilities, the coordinate and co-equal responsibilities, of reflecting the will of the people in the great task, which faces the Government today. I see among you some few who were my colleagues in the drafting of the Constitution of this Commonwealth, of what will soon be a free Republic. Some few days ago, on May 28, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines. This I intend to do with all the vigor at my command. I am firmly convinced that laws are wiser guides than individuals in regulating the proper conduct of human affairs. I pledge before you an administration based on law. The Constitution will be the \u201cArk of the Covenant\u201d which I will protect from violation and desecration with every power and every force at my disposal. I do not take this pledge lightly. I have a profound conviction that constitutional government in all the subtle meanings of the phrase is the only type of government which can safe- guard the rights of the people even against the abuses of the Government itself. Constitutions may be perfected but the fabric of government once tom by disrespect for the basic law of the land can be repaired only with the greatest difficulty.\r\nIt is my constitutional duty to report to you on the state of the nation and to make to you such recommendations as I deem proper for dealing with the intricate problems which face us today.\r\nI need not dwell too long on our present situation. I have referred to that situation in all its aspects in public speeches, both here and in the United States. All of you can see with your own eyes the destruction which surrounds us and the grave perils which threaten our survival as a nation. We have less than five weeks, 31 days to be exact, in which to make the necessary preparations for the assumption of independent nationhood. Even under ordinary conditions, this would be a short space for so great a task. There are many steps, which must be taken to provide for the transition. The legislation needed for this transition will be duly submitted to you. But the problems we must solve are much greater ones than those of crossing the line from Commonwealth status to the status of a free Republic. Our people are to inherit a prostrate and war-devastated land. The extent of that devastation was total. Despite the hum and bustle of activity in our cities, we have not yet started on the major premises of reconstruction. Let me describe briefly the aspects of the problems we face both as a Government and as a nation.\r\nWe are faced first of all by the fact that our Government is without financial means to support even its basic functions, not to speak of the great projects in rehabilitation and economic development, which we contemplate and which are, indeed, vital to our continued existence.\r\nA tentative pared-to-the-bone budget estimate for the next year projects expenditures of over 250 million pesos. Using the present sources of government revenue as a basis for estimation of expectable income, we can count on only about 40 million pesos for the coming fiscal year. In our fiscal year of national existence we are budgeting a deficit of over 200 million pesos. We have little prospect of a balanced budget for some years to come. And these figures are cited without including public works, irrigation and the many projects we must undertake to reconstruct our shattered land and provide for the care and protection of those of our population who today are suffering most acutely from the after-effects of war.\r\nOur currency, sound in monetary terms, pegged to the American dollar and fully supported by dollar reserves in the United States, is nevertheless suffering from a vast over expansion in circulation. Today there are in circulation over 800 million pesos, compared to the pre-war total of about 200 million pesos. Partly a result of this over-circulation is the present inflation of value. Prices are far beyond reason. A scarcity of commodities and a super-abundance of currency in circulation have given us a national price structure shot through with confusion and injustices to our consumers, wage earners, salaried employees and even producers whose income cannot keep pace with the vaulting scale of prices.\r\nOur national production itself is a pittance. Where we exported annually before the war 240 million pesos of goods, we may, with good fortune, expect to export 30 million pesos worth of goods this year .Our imports this year will exceed 300 million pesos, several times what we have ever imported before. The savings of our people and the windfall of money brought us by the liberation forces are rapidly disappearing. They will disappear at an even faster rate unless we arrest the unfavorable balance of trade with drastic measures. The most obvious remedy is to increase our production and exports. This we must do without delay.\r\nOur basic production potential could not be permanently affected by war. But our productive facilities have been pitifully destroyed. Practically all our tractors and 60 per cent of our work animals disappeared through the war. There is a continuing tendency to divert work animals from the fields to the slaughterhouses. This tendency must be halted.\r\nOur transportation facilities, as you all know, have been completely disrupted. Only in recent weeks has the United States Government been disposing of trucks and motor vehicles at a sufficient rate to enable us to look forward to some measure of transportation recovery. But our roads are a shambles, with a vicious tendency to deplete our usable motor vehicles and at the same time impede the rate of the flow of goods to market. Waterborne transport, especially in coastwise trade, is still only a fraction of what it should be.\r\nOur communications, radio and telegraph, are completely disrupted. With many of our fellow citizens we still have no communication whatsoever. Business operations are seriously crippled by the lack of communications. The only radio broadcasting facilities now available are those owned and operated by the United States Government. Most of our people lack radio receiving sets with which to keep informed of world events or even of events in their own homeland.\r\nMost of our railroads are depleted of rolling stock and the lines themselves are in a sad state of disrepair. Bridges and roads are in crying need of reconstruction.\r\nPublic health and sanitation have retreated far from the level, which existed before the war. Epidemic is a constant threat. The three great pests of our land\u2013the rat, the mosquito, and the locust\u2013have thrived on our misfortunes and threaten us with both disease and hunger. Control measures against all of them must be taken.\r\nFamine is a strong possibility; shortages of food are even now critical. We are immediately faced by a shortage, which will grow more critical within the next few months- j in our staple food product-rice. In some sections of the country rice is not being planted because of the lack of carabaos and the threat of rats and locusts. In others, planting is diminished because of the absence of law and order and the fear that the harvest may be stolen. There is a world shortage of rice. Many nations of the earth are as unfortunate as we; in the case of our own shortage we can expect very little assistance from abroad. We are doing everything in our power to get as much assistance as we can. I fear that we must look to our own resources to supply a major part of our requirements over the next critical six months.\r\nHousing is an urgent need in our urban areas. The squalor and congestion in which many of our people live are seriously affecting the health of our younger generation. In some areas of this very city the conditions are such as to shock the national conscience.\r\nI need not describe the sad state of public buildings. The very hall in which I\u2019ve sat is a tragic testimonial to what has occurred here. We are reduced to convening in a former Japanese schoolhouse while the proud Legislative Building we had built before the war lies in ghastly, ugly ruin. Most of our government functions are being carried on in crowded, temporary or bombed-out structures. Many government activities have been huddled together in congested quarters. Supply and equipment for government offices are at low level. Inefficiency, as a result, takes its toll.\r\nBut the central fact of our economic condition is the tragic destruction of the productive economy. Sugar, hemp, copra, coconut oil, cigars, tobacco, minerals and lumber those were once the staples, which we exported overseas. Today 60 per cent of our sugar mills are destroyed; most of the others are in complete disrepair. Machinery has been broken, stolen, or rusted away. Most of the lands themselves lie fallow.\r\nIn a land where coconut was once king not a single coconut oil mill remains intact. Many of our coconut plantations are without means of transport to carry copra to market, nor from market to export channels. I might go on to record our agricultural and productive ills, but they are known to all of you.\r\nOur gold mines are still flooded; the timbers have rotted away. We have only now begun to work in our chrome and manganese mines.\r\nThe great carpet of timber, which covers a part of our land, is in need of sawmills and other equipment necessary to exploit this resource.\r\nThe one product for which we are known throughout the world and for whose supply the world depends chiefly on us abaca is in a similar situation. The great Davao lands are largely untended and their ownership is in controversy. We intend to settle this controversy and to rehabilitate the plantations at an early date.\r\nThere have been lately established increases in the price of copra. I have every reason to hope that a similar increase in the price of abaca will soon be authorized. These prices will give incentive to our producers. But there are many other measures, which must be taken to restore the economy of those products, measures which I shall bring to your attention at the appropriate time.\r\nThese are not yet all of our ills. The cruel scythe of war has left in its wake a chaff of violence and terror. In the Central Luzon provinces, and in one of the provinces of Mindanao, force prevails rather than law. Bands of men possessing illegal arms defy the forces of peace and order and have instituted their own misguided rule. It is estimated that over 300,000 arms are illegally held in the Philippines today. Social and economic injustices especially acute in those areas have been proper soil for the harvest of violence. We shall do our best to remedy the economic ailments, the best that is within our means and our under- standing. We will not permit for one unnecessary moment the defiance of law or the imposition of tyrannical terror. Peace and order will be restored with understanding, with tolerance and with proper regard for the causes which gave rise to this development. But there will be no compromise j with lawlessness, no trafficking with terror. Laws will be obeyed and arms will be surrendered. The welfare of the people of those areas will be safeguarded.\r\nI have described in rough detail the obvious difficulties we face. Each of them requires prescriptive treatment of its own. Many of these situations require a combination of remedies. All of them will take money. Some of them will take time.\r\nIn war many of our bravest sons fell, others suffered great physical injury. Many have returned home to find their jobs no longer in existence and their opportunities for employment gone. Widows and orphans look desperately for the assistance and comfort they deserve. The veterans and their dependents must be given all the help we can muster.\r\nIn regard to labor, we are faced by the growing specter of unemployment. Hundreds have been discharged from jobs on Army and Navy installations. Hundreds and thousands more will soon be. There are no productive enterprises available to absorb their energies. The labor force which was created by this war must have other outlet for employment. We must create those outlets.\r\nThere is no easy formula to solve this problem. It will require the aid not only of the United States, which we anticipate, but also a recognition by all our people of their duty to invest their savings in productive enterprises.\r\nThe United States Congress recently enacted two major pieces of legislation for our relief-one of them is the Trade Rehabilitation Act, and the other the War Damage Act. These Acts are major factors in our economic recovery. They have been the objects of great controversy in some quarters. One of them\u2013the Trade Rehabilitation Act\u2013requires implementation by the Philippine Congress. I shall address to this body within the next few days a special message dealing with this legislation. I will only say today that this legislation gives us our chance to activate our production potentials. Without this legislation we cannot immediately start our rehabilitation program; without this aid, I seriously doubt whether we would be able even to feed and clothe our people during the critical days ahead. Certainly we would be unable to establish the economic foundations required for the support of our independence.\r\nI have lately returned from the United States in company with High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, to whom we are all indebted for the indefatigable and effective interest he has shown in all our problems. For his work in our behalf on our Washington trip alone, we must all be deeply grateful. The first and foremost subject on our Washington agenda was\u2019 a loan. I asked for a government loan of approximately 800 million pesos to be lent to us in five yearly installments, the first installment to be 200 million pesos and the second 12 per cent less, the third 12! per cent less than that, and so forth. I pledged the good faith of this Government and of the Republic that is about to be for the repayment of this credit. I will need from this Congress authority to effectuate this transaction. I have also asked the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a government-owned bank, for a rehabilitation loan. We discussed projects, which will require 500 million pesos. This loan may take some time to negotiate. I intend to see that every peso of this loan, when made is wisely and economically expended for self-liquidating projects.\r\nIn my report to the Filipino people on the results of my mission to Washington, I listed some 40 subjects, which were taken up. I will refer here to some of those subjects. I have already mentioned the loan.\r\nWe took up the matter of military bases which are to be established by the United States in the Philippines under the terms of agreements reached between my predecessors and the Presidents of the United States and implemented by resolutions approved by the United States Congress and by the Philippine Congress less than a year ago. The specific determination of those bases is now under negotiation. I have not yet been formally advised of all the specific sites considered by the United States as necessary for the protection of both countries; I expect that final agreement will be reached very soon.\r\nWe also discussed in Washington the formal treaties, which will be necessary-a treaty of Friendship, Navigation and Commerce, and a treaty covering diplomatic recognition of our independent state. These treaties are the customary treaties between independent nations. We also made arrangements in Washington for the United States Government to invite all the recognized Governments of the world to acknowledge the independence of the Philippines and to enter into diplomatic relations with us. We shall have to negotiate similar treaties with them.\r\nWe discussed in Washington preparations for our Independence Day ceremonies. I had the privilege of inviting President Truman to be present in person to proclaim our free Republic. He expressed his eagerness to come, and will be here on July 4th, unless pressure of such public affairs as face him today prevent his leaving Washington.\r\nWe arranged for an exchange of ambassadors to be J effected very soon after July 4th. The United States Government is very anxious to establish here the highest ranking type of diplomatic representation and\r\nof course, are pleased to maintain our relations with the United States on the highest as well as on the most intimate level possible.\r\nPerhaps next in importance among the many subjects covered in Washington was the treatment of our veterans. From the very beginning of his assignment as American High Commissioner, Governor McNutt has interested him- self in the welfare of our veteran and in securing for them as nearly as possible all the rights and benefits available to American veterans. He has also been active in behalf of the definition of American obligations for the redemption of guerrilla currency.\r\nThere is a great deal of misunderstanding here regarding the so-called GI Bill of Rights. There is also a lack of comprehension of the inapplicability of most of its provisions to the Philippines. American veterans residing in foreign territory are n6t eligible, generally speaking, for the benefits of the GI Bill of Rights. These benefits consist of guaranteed loans through banks, on homes, and on business ventures, of unemployment compensation on the basis of certification by the United States Employment Service that no employment is available, and of educational opportunities in certified and accredited schools, whose curricula are supervised by the Veterans Administration. The laws pro- viding for the administration of these benefits are closely correlated with the laws of the United States and of the several States of the Union. We have no comparable laws in the Philippines, nor do our banks or our universities fulfill the requirements established by the United States Veterans Administration. Thus it was found by American authorities that it was legally impossible to apply the GI Bill of Rights to the Philippines. It will be even less possible after July fourth. In fact, the Veterans Administration has no legal right to operate here in any capacity after July fourth without special United States legislation.\r\nI was informed that it was for these reasons that the United States Congress specifically withdrew all veterans\u2019 benefits except insurance, and death and disability pensions from Filipino veterans.\r\nDuring our stay in Washington we discussed this matter at considerable length with American officials. The President of the United States, cognizant of the great sacrifices made in war by our soldiers, submitted to Congress a bill, first of all, granting the Veterans Administration authority to operate in the Philippines after July fourth; second, providing hospitalization privileges for Philippine veterans; and third, providing a burial gratuity. After July fourth, these benefits alone will be greater in extent than those provided for American veterans living in foreign lands. But President Truman promised even more. He pledged that educational and employment opportunities would be made available to Philippine veterans as soon as a practicable program could be formulated. I shall recommend to the American authorities that these benefits be in the form of an outright grant of funds to provide free instruction to veterans in our educational institutions and for useful employment projects for veterans. Some legislation will be required to implement these benefits. A law will also be necessary punishing fraudulent representations made before the Veterans Administration. I shall recommend such a bill as soon as the United States Congress has acted on the Philippine Veterans legislation. I also recommend that legislation be enacted by the Philippine Congress making benefits received from the United States Veterans Administration non-taxable.\r\nSome discrimination against our veterans is involved in the provision that benefits for Filipinos will be paid on a peso-for-dollar basis. I have instructed Commissioner Romulo in Washington to seek to have this discrimination eliminated if at all possible. It should be understood, how- ever, that these benefits are to be paid for by United States taxpayers including American veterans for generations to come. American veterans will be contributing to the cost of their own benefits. Filipinos will not be asked to make any such contribution. I point this out to show that in the matter of veterans benefits, we must rely more on the generosity of the United States than on any right we may claim. I have the assurance of the President of the United States that widows, orphans, the sick and the disabled will be cared for promptly and, to this end, legislation has been introduced in Congress. I have asked for the speediest possible action on this legislation for the emergency needs of those who suffered the most from this war.\r\nI look forward to the day when our own Government can shoulder the burden of the care of our own veterans. We have that much pride in our freedom and in our independence. We have that much gratitude to those who helped save this nation and its freedom from a cruel and barbarous enemy.\r\nAfter the United States Congress has completed action on Philippine Veterans legislation, I will submit to this Congress not only such legislation as is necessary to implement. United States Veterans measures but also such portions of the Filipino GI Rights bill passed by the Philip- pine Senate some months ago as are desirable to assure adequate justice and assistance to our fighting men.\r\nIn regard to emergency and guerrilla currency, we asked in Washington for the speediest determination by the War Department of its share of the obligation incurred. As soon as this determinati6n is made, we shall enter into negotiations with the United States looking forward to the redemption of this money or of such a percentage of it as will be fair and equitable to those who received it in payment for goods or services. Meanwhile I will recommend to the Congress, if it proves necessary, steps to prevent the further drift of this currency into the hands of speculators and profiteers. I issue this warning now: That we will take every precaution against the realization of even a cent of profit by those whohave purchased for speculative purposes the currency which helped gain the victory.\r\nThe matter of guerrilla currency is not our only problem involving currency. It is necessary that this nation, when it becomes independent, have an entirely new currency as soon as practicable, replacing both the pre-war currency and the present victory money. We entered into negotiations with Treasury Department officials in Washington and have made tentative arrangements for the printing of a new issue of money by the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. Special legislation will be required to authorize the issue.\r\nAnother matter of most vital concern to us is the food situation. We canvassed prospects for obtaining more food imports with Herbert Hoover, with Mayor LaGuardia and with Agriculture Department officials. Rice is our critical requirement. But there is very little rice to be had anywhere in the world today. We were encouraged by Mr. Hoover to get what rice we can from Siam. We are in the process of conducting negotiations with the Siamese Government for the exchange office for surplus motor vehicles, but I do not have any great hope for the success of this undertaking. Our own agricultural experts tell us that we may expect a critical rice shortage in our land far exceeding anything that we have known up to this time, probably beginning in August. In anticipation of this situation, I have directed the National Rice and Corn Corporation to store and seal all available rice in order that we may distribute this rice on the basis of direst need to meet actual famine conditions. We shall not cease our efforts to obtain whatever rice we can from whatever sources we have. In Washington we were promised some shipments of corn and perhaps other cereal substitutes, but I must warn the Congress and the people of the Philippines that emergency action must be taken to husband our cur- rent food supplies. Voluntary rationing must be instituted. I also exhort all my countrymen to start immediately growing corn, root crops, vegetables, and all other foods, which can replace rice in the national diet. I have directed every agency of the Government to help me in planning a campaign of encouragement and assistance to our people in starting \u201cAnti-Famine Gardens\u201d and plantations. Only in this way can we hope to save ourselves from want.\r\nI also discussed in Washington the controversial Property Bill. I discussed this with Congressional leaders, with the Alien Property Custodian and with the heads of other Government Agencies. I am convinced beyond doubt that the intentions of the American Government in this connection are without guile or motive, and that it is simply designed to facilitate the operation of rehabilitation and other assistance agencies in the Philippines after Independence. There has been some difference of opinion between us on provisions, which would affect the disposition of enemy properties, largely agricultural lands. I have taken the position that these lands must be turned over to the Philippine Government and that until such a transfer is agreed upon, we must oppose with all our vigor the so-called Property Bill to which otherwise we can have no valid objection. I expect this matter to come to a head within a few days.\r\nThe third vital legislative matter taken up in Washington concerned the War Damage Act. I have urged the utmost speed in setting up the War Damage Commission and in expediting its activities in the Philippines. This will necessarily be delayed until Congress appropriates the one billion forty million pesos authorized in that Act. While in Washington, we asked Congressional leaders and especially the chairmen of the appropriation committees to give this particular appropriation item every possible priority. I received definite assurances that prompt action will be taken to this end.\r\nA minor but complicated problem is presented by our lack of sufficient trained personnel to take over the function of foreign representation in the several world capitals and other places where we require diplomatic and consular representatives. I was able to arrange in Washington for the intensification of training program being conducted by the Department of State in our behalf, and meantime I have arranged for the State Department to handle our diplomatic and consular representation until we are able to take over that function.\r\nOne of the factors which most critically impedes our economic rehabilitation is the lack of sufficient ship transport, especially for the coastwise service. In Washington we discussed this with the War Shipping Administration, with the Maritime Commission and with Surplus Property officials. We were assured that we would be given all the ships and watercraft suitable to our needs that are available for transfer. But there are administrative and other difficulties, which must be met. Meanwhile I ask this Congress to make a study of the desirability of Government control of shipping to a much greater degree than has heretofore been undertaken. I suggest that an agency with powers similar to those of the United States Maritime Commission be established to encourage the growth of a Philippine Merchant Marine and to regulate its operations. I should like to see the Congress review our present ship- ping laws with a view to inducing ships from other lands to register under our flag and to be manned by Filipino crews. This is urgently desirable in order to capture a portion of Japan\u2019s pre-war shipping business. While I feel that shipping should be a private undertaking, we must keep in mind that shipping is as vital as food itself to the economy of some of our islands. It may not be profitable for private enterprise to extend lines to some of our more distant ports. If private enterprise will not undertake some of these operations, the Government must.\r\nI have discussed at some length the problems that came up during the eight days of our stay in Washington and some of the solutions at which we arrived. I have yet to report to the Congress on the many urgent matters, which must occupy its attention, in addition to those I have mentioned. I do not think any Congress in Philippine history has ever faced the heavy responsibilities, which confront you. You will be called upon to consider a hundred complex legislative proposals, each of them marked with the red tag of urgency. Most of the bills, which will be submitted to you, will be\r\nThere is no way to ease this burden or slough off this responsibility. It is my plain duty to report to you now on all major problems we must consider. Because of the parallel urgency of these matters I will not arrange them in order of importance. I will deal with them by subject matter.\r\nWe must first of all attack as best we can the problem of our government finances. The projected loan from the United States Government will be only of transient value to us unless we immediately lay a sound and sensible basis for government financing. I propose that our entire budget procedure be reviewed and that a more flexible technique both for determining budgetary needs and for allocating our expenditures be devised. I propose the establishment in the Executive Office of a strong Budget Bureau authorized by Congress to review the budget estimates of the various departments and then to pass upon authorized appropriations before expenditures are made, on the basis of need. I propose that this Budget Bureau have the power of recommendation on revenue measures so that revenue and expenditures may be intimately correlated.\r\nI have already directed that there be undertaken a detailed review of the functions of the Government Departments and the percentage efficiency not only of the Departments themselves but of the personnel employed. Inefficient operations of the Executive and Administrative departments will be eliminated. Unnecessary personnel will be dropped. Duplicate functions will be combined. In order to effect this, I ask the Congress for adequate powers of reorganization covering bureaus, divisions, agencies and commissions.\r\nI urge the grant of this authority especially because of the imminence of independence and the consequent necessity of reorganizing government functions to meet the needs of our new status. For the period of the next few years some of our agencies will be required to be so organized as to function in cooperation with federal agencies established for rehabilitation purposes here. I ask this authority for a period of one year, subject to such review as Congress may deem proper.\r\nI shall not have had the opportunity to make all the necessary budgetary adjustments in the budget, which I will submit to you shortly. But I shall submit toward the end of this session a Recession Bill, making such modifications and accomplishing such economies as can be effected after further study.\r\nHaving pared expenditures for the ordinary expenses of Government to their lowest possible level, we must proceed to study our sources of revenue. I believe our income tax to be entirely inadequate, in the light of the national need and the emergency situation we face. Taxes must be raised to reasonable levels without discouraging enterprise or business expansion. I believe firmly in the principle of taxation on the basis of ability to pay. An up-to-date tax system will be submitted for your consideration.\r\nSome individuals have accumulated through the war years considerable fortunes, while others of our countrymen were offering their lives on the altar of freedom. As a measure to effect social justice as well as to obtain desperately needed revenue, I propose the imposition of a war profits tax based on taxable income and the increase in capital assets from 1941 to 1945.\r\nThere must be, in addition to these specific taxes, a general overhauling of our tax structure. I propose for this purpose to appoint a commission, with the power to engage technical and expert assistance from the United States. Taxes must be realistically readjusted to the inflation, which holds us in its grip. Taxes in a sense, represent forced savings. Under present circumstances, increased taxes are a type of bloodletting which will do much to cure the high blood pressure of the current inflation.\r\nMeanwhile the people\u2019s confidence in financial and credit institutions must be strengthened further to lure savings into the productive streams of industrial and commercial credit rather than into mere competition for consumption commodities. The full rehabilitation of the banks and the strengthening of our banking laws will be another long step toward the trapping of inflation and its localization in the consumption market. A commission will be appointed to study our banking laws and to recommend, if it is found desirable, a central bank to become the fiscal agency of the Government in the control of credit, to act as the clearing house for inter-bank transactions, to manage bank reserves and to afford more flexibility in our currency system.\r\nInsurance companies must come under the same type of review. We must tighten up our laws regulating insurance so that the people\u2019s savings in these institutions will be as safe and secure as we can make them.\r\nMeanwhile, further to increase the general confidence in banks, we must enact legislation enforcing on all banks equal liability for deposits made prior to the war and transferred by the Japanese to the Bank of Taiwan and the Yokohama Specie Bank. These transfers affected Americans, allied nationals, and loyal Filipinos. Funds affected also include trust funds held for widows and orphans in the Philippines of American soldiers of past wars. Proper claims can be made by the banks against the Japanese Government, but meanwhile depositors must be protected.\r\nPresent law places nationals of neutral countries and even enemy nationals in a favorable position as compared to Americans, allied nationals and those Filipinos who were penalized in similar fashion. Such neutrals and enemy nationals can now collect their outstanding pre-war deposits while Americans, allied nationals and some loyal Filipinos are denied that right.\r\nIt is essential to economic rehabilitation that easy credit be made available to small investors; homebuilders and producers. It may be necessary for the Government to guarantee small business and farm loans. That matter should be studied.\r\nSteps should be taken immediately to rehabilitate fully the Postal Savings Bank and to authorize the payment of deposits. When funds are available, I shall request Congress to appropriate the necessary funds for this purpose. Further to stabilize the national credit structure, every assistance should be given for the rehabilitation of Building and Loan Associations. Likewise Credit Cooperatives should be encouraged.\r\nWhen we obtain the loan from the Export-Import Bank, I will propose that we organize in the Philippines a Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, capitalized with the amount of the loan, and authorized to make loans for rehabilitation and economic development projects. But these loans must be made on a sound self-liquidating business basis. I also propose that this corporation itself be authorized to under- take rehabilitation projects when in the public interest and when duly authorized by Congress or the President.\r\nThe United States Government is now maintaining here an office of Frozen Foreign Funds Control. Its functions will end on July 4th. I propose that we immediately establish a frozen fund control office in the Department of Finance to take over from the United States Treasury r Department this important function. Accounts and assets l of persons under indictment for collaboration with the enemy must continue to be blocked, pending the disposal of their cases. I propose, however, that the secret \u201cwatch list\u201d based on administrative and not judicial evidence be abolished as soon as it is within our power to do so. The United States Treasury Department has offered to make available technical assistance as well as its records to any agency which we set up to handle this problem. I urge prompt action so that our own agency may be functioning before independence.\r\nSo much for our financial institutions.\r\nIn addition to the studies already discussed, I will ask funds for the expenses of commissions for the study of the following matters:\r\n1. A study of water power development all over the country.\r\n2. A study of our educational system, with a view to the\u00a0development of an educational program in high schools and colleges oriented to the training of Filipinos in citizenship in an independent nation.\r\n3. An agrarian commission to study the general and specific aspects of our land problem, the relationship between landlord and tenant, the redistribution of lands now held in large estates in congested areas, the opening of public land to settlement and exploitation by small farmers, and other approaches to this troubled situation.\r\n4. A port commission to study the congestion in Manila Harbor and to recommend means and methods for relieving this congestion and to prevent pilferage. This commission will also pre- pare a program for port development throughout the Philippines.\r\nThere will be other commissions, whose formation I will propose or direct from time to time. I am not suggesting that this will be a government by commissions. Commissions are fact-finding bodies to ascertain the nature and scope of the problems assigned them and to recommend the best and most economical methods of solving those problems.\r\nAnother of our most serious situations, of course, is inflation. Fundamentally, inflation can only be cured by the production and the importation of sufficient goods to satisfy the market and to allow for free competition. That goal is far in the future. I do not know when we will reach it. For the moment and for some months to come we will be living in a land of scarcity-scarcity of food, scarcity of building materials, scarcity of textiles, scarcity of machinery. While we are building up our stocks from abroad, while we are getting our own production into gear, we must control prices, minimize the black market, prevent profiteering and obviate the suicidal race between prices and wages.\r\nWith the increase in the prices of the necessities of life come demands for increases in wages-demands, which are justified if there is no other way of enabling men to live. Upon the increase of wages there follows closely an increase in the price of the products whose producers have been accorded the increase. Laborers who do not get the in- crease in pay are likely to strike; and strikes curtail production, viciously worsening the situation in a never-ending cycle. I ask wider authority to control prices. That authority may be on a renewable basis; I do not intend to use it for any commodity nor for any longer time than is absolutely essential for the welfare of our people. But where it is necessary, it is my purpose to enforce to the limit price ceilings. The experience other nations have had in this matter indicates that expenditures involved in administering and enforcing price ceilings in periods of scarcity result in tremendous savings to the people themselves.\r\nAs we begin to rebuild under the terms of the war damage act and under the terms of such rehabilitation legislation as we ourselves may enact or provide, there will come a destructive scramble for building materials and for the hire of skilled construction workers. We must have authority to control the prices of these materials and to stabilize wages for certain types of workers in the skilled trades.\r\nControl must also be established over rents, especially rents for dwellings occupied by small-salaried employees and workers. During a period of housing scarcity, rent ceilings are essential in any planned program of inflationary control. Profiteering based on scarcity of housing must be ended. The administration of rent ceilings will necessarily be confined to the urban areas where the shortage is critical.\r\nI believe that price control should extend even to places of amusement such as motion picture theaters. The movie has come to be a major cultural institution looming large in the lives of many of our people. The price of this facility must be kept within the bounds of reason.\r\nIt may seem to some that we in the Philippines are about to encumber ourselves with controls and irksome regulations while other peoples of the world are discarding them. But we are just beginning to fight in our current war, our war against destruction and prostration. Just as in the war against the Axis, we cannot, we dare not, lose.\r\nAs we start out on the road to rehabilitation, as we make our plans for the reconstruction of our country, we must work along two lines. The first is the simplest\u2013to rebuild those industries and those enterprises, which were destroyed by the war. But that is only half our goal. We must also plan and work in terms of broadening our economy, of securing wider and wider participation in business and industry of greater and greater numbers of individuals.\r\nOne answer to this, of course, is small business. Small business is one of the bulwarks of democracy. Small factories, small shops, small processing plants attracting the ingenuity of individuals and the enterprise of small groups, are economically essential and socially desirable. I recommend that we establish, perhaps within the framework of a general Rehabilitation Authority, a small business division, the sole task of which will be to encourage and promote small business. I have already suggested that special financial and credit facilities be made available and I suggest now that technical advice and assistance be also provided.\r\nWhen the War Damage Commission begins to function here, it will be faced by the problem of weighing claims of approximately one million claimants. It will be a monumental task to assay and decide these claims. Each claimant, small or large, will be forced to present his claim in legal and standardized form with supporting affidavits. The same thing, incidentally, is true and will be true for the presentation of claims before the Veterans Administration. I therefore ask, in order to assist small claimants, that the Government establish a Legal Service Bureau for the purpose of helping the poor to prepare their claims for the War Damage Commission and the Veterans Administration. This service should be free in cases where need is shown. I do not think we are unduly prejudicing the legal profession in the Philippines for they will have many more claims than they can handle. The War Damage Commission especially is bound by a time limit for the submission and consideration of claims. We must do everything in our power to expedite the payments and permit the orderly progress of the reconstruction work.\r\nI come now to what I would consider the most urgent problem we have, if I should select one. That is the law and order situation. For the proper, intelligent and impartial enforcement of law, I propose that we establish a State Police, authorization for which is already embodied in our Constitution. I ask that the Congress grant me the discretion to assign the State Police either to the Department of the Interior or retain it directly in the Executive Office of the President. The police force must be a civilian body although its members will be selected largely from our defense forces. But it will not be a military force. By intensive training and, we hope, with the aid of the United States law enforcement agencies, we plan to fit the members of our police force for their difficult and trying task. They must know the law and the constitutional premises of our Government. They must enforce law in the manner prescribed by law, impartially and without fear.\r\nI also ask for the strengthening of the Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, whose function will be to apprehend violators of national laws, and to guard against bribery, corruption and graft in government. This force will not be a Gestapo but rather the watchman for the public conscience.\r\nI recommend an increase in the penalty for the illegal possession of firearms, especially automatic rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, bombs and heavier armaments.\r\nI also propose that the assembly of more than five persons carrying illegal firearms shall constitute presumption of conspiracy to commit acts of banditry.\r\nAs to the Army, I have already made my position clear. The standing regular Army should consist of approximately 12,000 mobile, well equipped, well trained troops, an Army of which the State Police would be a reserve. These troops must be trained in the latest mechanics of combat, in the use of modem weapons and modem tactics.\r\nWhile we are maintaining a small compact professional force, we must also train our reserves. We must continue to train at least 5,000 reserve officers annually in the universities end colleges. The training should be as modem and as forward-looking as possible. Students who elect medical training or other professional branches will be admitted into the reserve corps without standard and routine training in arms. I propose that we continue universal military training with this modification: that there be one year of training for all youths upon reaching the age of 18, except those training in colleges, But training in mechanical and technical skills will be provided when aptitude for such skills is shown. We must train technicians as well as infantrymen for our citizen army. Training of air corps pilots and of a ground maintenance force should also be provided on a modest scale. Commercial air pilots, navigators and engineers should be made automatically eligible for membership in our reserve forces.\r\nIn the Philippines we have inherited from the United States a happy tradition of a non-political army, an army whose personnel take no part in national or local politics. A professional army must be a non-political army. There was some weakening in the fabric of this restriction in recent months, I shall take every step within my power to restore the doctrine of abstention from politics for the army.\r\nWe are already training an offshore patrol and we have arranged to obtain from the United States Navy such ships, boats and other watercraft as will be required, For the time being, the offshore patrol will be under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Army but I shall propose at some time in the future that a separate service be established so that it may become the nucleus of a naval force. The patrol\u2019s present function will be to prevent smuggling and illegal entry, to cooperate with the merchant marine, to maintain all maritime services, and .to assume jurisdiction over the coast and geodetic survey.\r\nThere is pending in the United States Congress today a bill authorizing the Army and Navy to cooperate with us not only in the training of personnel but also in the transfer to the Philippine Army of ships, aircraft; arms, equipment, stores and supplies. I am confident that the United States Congress will approve this proposal before July 4th, We could not maintain an Army or an offshore patrol without it.\r\nAs I have already stated in my summary of activities in Washington, we are facing problems in the establishment and arrangement of our foreign relations after July fourth. One of our immediate tasks is to arrange for the orderly liquidation of the Office of the Resident Commissioner in Washington and the establishment of an embassy, I propose that all employees of the Resident Commissioner be given a service bonus amounting to one month\u2019s salary for every year of continuous satisfactory service in that office, Those accepting employment with the new Embassy will not be eligible for this bonus.\r\nI propose that all properties of the Office of the Resident Commissioner be transferred to the Philippine Embassy when established.\r\nIt will be necessary to make legal provision for the establishment of a Department of State which will have, among its functions, jurisdiction over all properties to be acquired for foreign service purposes abroad and over foreign service personnel under such rules and regulations as Congress may prescribe.\r\nI have asked the Department of State in Washington to assign to us a foreign service expert to help us draft these rules and regulations and also an over-all pattern for our Department of State, When these studies are completed, I will submit the proposed legislation to this Congress.\r\nI shall also ask the Congress to make provisions by appropriation and otherwise for adequate representation of the Philippines in all international bodies in which the interests of our country are involved. I propose that blanket authorization be given the President to name representatives to international bodies and that adequate funds be provided in a discretionary appropriation for the pay, transportation and subsistence of such representatives pending the inclusion of such an item in a general budget for our independent Department of State.\r\nFor the further promotion of our trade and commerce, the Congress should study ways and means for the establishment in the Philippines of a free port zone so that it may become the transit point for goods flowing from the western hemisphere, the assembly area for heavy machinery, equipment and motor vehicles, the site of oil refineries for export petroleum products, and the distribution and ware- housing center for goods destined for all parts of the Orient. Future developments might include shipyards and ship repair facilities for the vessels of the Far East.\r\nAnother of our major problems is transport and communications, some of whose aspects I have already discussed. I consider harmful to the public interest the present practice of Congress of retaining the authority to issue licenses and franchises for radio broadcasting stations, airlines and some public utilities. This is a practice which legislative bodies in other parts of the world have long abandoned. Public utilities must be regulated and controlled in the public interest. This can be done effectively only if the power to regulate is combined with the power to license. In the case of major public utilities, the Public Service Commission should be given that authority. Transport facilities and radio stations flourish best in competitive circumstances. Competition among them must be encouraged for the best public service. Because they partake of the nature of a public utility, they, too, must be closely regulated in the public interest. And, as in the case of utilities, the power of regulation must be combined with the power of licensing. The details of regulatory supervision of these facilities are far too great to be handled by legislative bodies. Congress should establish the regulatory and licensing bodies and lay down policies and requirements and leave to the administrative agencies the semi-judicial function of licensing and regulating. There is an intrinsic evil in maintaining this power in legislative hands, le3.ding as it does, to log- rolling, legislative lobbying and, too frequently, to monopoly. The practice of democracy and free enterprise demands that competition in those fields where competition is practicable be encouraged. I, therefore, propose that an Air Transport Authority and a Communications Authority be established, their general policies to be laid down by Congress. The chief criterion of the operation of these public facilities must be public interest and public convenience. Authority must be granted to these bodies to issue rules and regulations to enforce compliance with the public interest and convenience. It should be provided that licenses to operate will be issued on a periodically renewable basis and may be revoked for sufficient and legally definable cause. The Communications Authority should be authorized to assign wavelength frequencies allocated to the Philippines by international agreement. Broadcasting stations can be required to include in their program educational and instructive material; advertising can be regulated to prevent unfair and unethical practices. Radio can and should be a major educational influence in the life of our people. Only a regulatory body can guarantee this in practice.\r\nWith regard to aviation, every encouragement should be given to expansion and improvement of air services on the basis of free competition. Airlines should provide transportation links to unify our land and bind it together more closely than ever before. A proper regulatory body can carry out this policy and, at the same time, enforce the rules of aviation safety, establish standards of operation and fix rates. In no other way can this industry properly and safely expand.\r\nI shall not at this time undertake an extensive review of the problems confronting our judicial system. They must be carefully and painstakingly studied, and some of our judicial practices revised. For the moment, however, there is one problem of paramount urgency which, if solved, will greatly expedite the work of our courts.\r\nThe Court of Appeals was established several years ago to relieve congestion of cases in the Supreme Court. Last year the Court was abolished in the belief that by increasing the number of justices in the Supreme Court, and by providing that the Court might sit in two divisions, that Court would be able to dispose of all cases coming from inferior courts. The result of this experiment has been to confirm the opinion of all those who were opposed to the abolition of the Court of Appeals, because the actual number of cases recently docketed in the Supreme Court and undisposed of by that tribunal removes any hope that the Supreme Court alone can dispose of all such cases. I, therefore, recommend that the Court of Appeals be re-established with the same jurisdiction granted to it under the laws of its creation.\r\nI have enumerated my proposals for the re-establishment of law and order. I have discussed the measures that will be necessary to strengthen the police force and to increase penalties for the violation of law. An agrarian commission is to be established to study the economic problems of the areas where unrest now prevails. The Congress must realize, as I realize, that the means with which we attempt to solve these problems must be within our finances and our capacity. Some time may be required before we can put all of our program, or even a large part of it, into operation. But the people must be assured that we will move as swiftly as we know how. The laws against usury, for instance, will be enforced strictly and thoroughly; the practice of charging excessive rates of interest to the poor must and will be stamped out. As soon as the legislative proposals on our agrarian problems are formulated, I will ask the Congress to give them every priority. I assure the Congress and the people of the Philippines that nothing will be left undone that can be done. Meanwhile, I should like to discuss briefly some of the other specific measures, which should be taken as soon as the means are available. We must import farm implements and make provision for their distribution and use. I propose that cooperatives be organized to make possible the general availability of tractors. We must import new livestock and poultry and develop varieties peculiarly suited to our own land.\r\nI propose that there be established an Institute of Nutrition to study our dietary habits and make recommendations for suitable modifications.\r\nCredit and technical assistance must be provided for the development of new commodity crops, such as ramie, peanuts, Soya beans and cotton.\r\nTo further increase our domestic food supply, we must take measures to stimulate the fishing industry. The United States Government has already voted us technical assistance and training facilities for deep-sea fishing. We must take advantage of those facilities to the limit of our ability.\r\nTo decrease the cost of fertilizers, we must establish fertilizing plants, both organic and chemical. These may be established in conjunction with waterpower sites. I have already listed waterpower development as a subject to which we must give intensive study.\r\nOur natural resources must be carefully husbanded. Many a nation, once great, has fallen by the wayside of I history as a result of the reckless dissipation of its natural, resources. Our soil must be kept rich and fertile. Our subsoil riches must be exploited according to plan and in the public interest. Reforestation must keep pace with the cutting of lumber. The work of our experimental agricultural stations must be expanded and the results of their work conveyed to every comer of the Philippines. For this reason, I place great emphasis on the development of radio, provincial newspapers and other publication media. Congress must plan to promote and encourage the development of these media so that the messages of government may be circulated widely among the people.\r\nLabor too must come into its own and must be given every protection in its right to organize. The powers of our Court of Industrial Relations must be revised. While we encourage and strengthen organized labor, we must make ample provision to insure the responsibility of labor and of labor unions. I propose that conciliation and mediation be recognized and emphasized as a proper procedure for the settlement of labor disputes and that a Conciliation Service be established in the Department of Labor. Legal provision should be made for labor disputes to be first submitted to the Secretary of Labor who would, only upon the failure of conciliation and mediation, certify a dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations. Compulsory arbitration should be the last resort. Voluntary agreement between management and labor should be the goal. The good offices of Government should always be available to prevent labor disputes before they reach the stage of strikes. When the vital public interest is involved, compulsory arbitration appears to be an essential device.\r\nThe stability of labor relations is one of the most important assurances which we can offer to private enterprise and to investors, large and small, for the planning and programming of economic ventures. Through the labor conciliation and arbitration methods I have suggested, a large measure of stability can be afforded. That stability must, of course, take into consideration the right of labor to have a living wage. Higher wages built on high and efficient production provide purchasing power for goods and start the cycle of production for consumption, which should be the goal of our economic development. For this great national need, we require the unstinted cooperation of both management and labor. Labor must be strong to shoulder its responsibilities; management must be intelligent and progressive to discharge its proper social functions.\r\nIn the present period of emergency, a Wage Stabilization Board to adjust inequities in wages and to operate in conjunction with the proposed Conciliation Service should be established. I believe that such a Board can best function as an independent agency under the Executive Office.\r\nAt an early date I shall direct the taking of an unemployment census in the Philippines, using available government personnel to do this important work. We must have the facts before we can attack successfully the problem of unemployment. I shall also direct the establishment of labor exchanges in each municipality, if possible, again attempting to use available government personnel. Should these prove inadequate, I will ask Congress to establish an employment service in the Department of Labor. As we proceed further in our program of social welfare, such a service will be essential for purposes of certification of unemployment as well as of placement.\r\nNor can we afford to forget the urgency of rehabilitating our educational institutions and our school system. I have placed this subject in the latter part of my message not because of its lesser importance. I can think of nothing, which is more vital to the nation in terms of our long-range growth and development. The functions of the school system from the primary grades through the universities are many. The spread of literacy is only one of them. Education, as we all know, is the hall maiden of liberty. The intelligent use of the ballot by the people in a democracy is in large measure dependent on the degree of enlightenment of the people. We must begin with the rehabilitation of our primary schools, the provision of adequate employment conditions for teachers and for their training. The University of the Philippines must be restored to its former primacy among the educational institutions of our land. Its facilities for scholarship and research must be restored and expanded. The professional schools must be given every encouragement. Whatever economies may be necessary, we cannot afford to overlook the great need of education. I have already indicated that a special commission will be appointed to review our educational system. We must move promptly to effectuate whatever suitable recommendations are made. Institutions for vocational education should be established at the earliest opportunity. Special educational facilities for adults should be provided.\r\nAs with education, so, too, we must take proper measures for the protection of the public health. The promotion of sanitation and the stamping out of disease has been one of the fields of our greatest advance. For this we have to i thank the United States Public Health Service.\r\nWhen we make the transition to independent status, the Bureau of Quarantine which is so essential for protection against epidemics and pests and parasites must be completely integrated in the Department of Health and Public Welfare. An amendment to our Administrative Code will be necessary. The requirements of the quarantine service in personnel and facilities, as well as in legal authority, must be met so that it can carry out its many functions, not the least of which is the enforcement of vaccination against plague, cholera, smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever. To permit the introduction of plagues into our land would be to expose ourselves to a loss as great as that of war itself.\r\nOur hospitals must be rehabilitated. Whatever financial aid is necessary must be provided. We can look forward to some assistance from the United States Government in terms of surplus property and training facilities. But much of that task must be undertaken by us.\r\nWe must provide for strict enforcement of food and drug standards and insure the cleanliness and sanitation of public eating places and processors of food. The health and vigor of our people is our first natural resource.\r\nI recognize the importance which reparations may play in our economic rehabilitation. Everything possible is already being done to lay our claims before the proper international organs. Pending the settlement of reparations on an international basis, we are trying to obtain interim reparations payments in kind. It may be necessary, after independence, to establish a formal reparations body. But for the time being that will not be required.\r\nIn our great concern with the economic and social problems, which surround us, we must not omit to do honor to our heroes of the recent past. I have already described the measures that we propose to take for the benefit of the widows and orphans of our soldier dead and for our veterans. In addition to the benefits I have described, veterans must be given priority in government employment, service and training facilities.\r\nThe greatest of our war dead was not a soldier on the field of battle. He was a statesman and leader whom we have enshrined in immortality. I am referring, of course, to the late President Quezon. We made arrangements in Washington to transfer his remains from the United States to the Philippines, to arrive here on August 1. I ask that Congress provide a special appropriation of P50,000 for a state funeral and for the erection of a temporary mausoleum to contain the remains of the great leader. I say temporary because I am also proposing that funds be raised by contribution for the erection of a great memorial in which finally to house his casket. I am recommending also a second great memorial, this one to America, in recognition of the 48 years of our historic relationship, and in recognition of the greatness of mind and heart of the American people who have done and are continuing to do so much to make our national existence possible.\r\nThese two great memorials should be so situated that they will be focal points of the capital city of the Philippines. In this connection we must speed to completion our work of city planning. I will soon send to the Congress legislation providing a definition of our capital city-planning proposals. Meanwhile, I have asked the planning com- mission now at work to complete its studies as rapidly as possible.\r\nWhen United States Government agencies are ready to begin the\u2019 reconstruction of our public buildings, we must be ready with the plans and with a program of priorities. I propose the establishment of a special commission to study this matter and to formulate proposals for submission to the Philippine War Damage Commission of the United States.\r\nWe must see in the ruins around us the vision of a great national capital rising in resplendent beauty from the ashes and rubble of destruction.\r\nGentlemen of the Congress, I have addressed you at great length and have touched sketchily upon many subjects, which deserve more attention than I have given them. There are many matters which I entirely omitted but which you will be called upon to consider. It was impossible to include them all in a single message. I know that in the tasks I have outlined, this Congress, this representative body of the Filipino people, will be equal to its responsibilities. I am sure that you will discharge your duties in the best and highest traditions of the long line of great Philippine representative bodies. Yours is the duty and the responsibility of legislating, mine, that of administering. I will undertake to the best of my ability to carry out the policies you finally determine, and to enforce the laws you enact. I will not intrude upon the legislative functions of this body.\r\nI hope there will always be, as I am sure there is now, complete understanding between us and a spirit of cooperation which will enable us to move together along the bewildering paths of our immediate future toward the bright day of prosperity and security.\r\nWith faith in each other and in the people of the Philippines, we will succeed in our tasks, so help us God.\r\nNOTE.-The President\u2019s report to the Filipino people, referred to in this message, was contained in a statement jointly issued by him and Commissioner McNutt on May 22, 1946, the day after his arrival from his mission in the United States. That statement listed the various matters more or less successfully taken up by his mission. Many of them are discussed in the above message on the state of the nation. Those not specifically mentioned therein are enumerated herein below.\r\nPost-independence relationship between the Philippine peso and the U. S. dollar.\r\nRefunding to the Philippine Government of $6,500,000 deposited in 1941 with the War Department as a bond guaranteeing the return of arms and supplies issued by the U. S. Army to the Philippine Army. Those arms were lost in the war.\r\nSettlement of fiscal balances held by the U. S. Treasury for the account of the Philippine Government.\r\nAcquisition by the Philippines of surplus property held in the United States, especially rolling stocks for railways.\r\nTraining programs for engineers, meteorologists, merchant marine officers, fishing experts and others in the United States under the terms of the War Damage Act.\r\nExtension of the life of U. S. passports held by Philippine citizens abroad beyond July 4, 1946, pending the issuance of Philippine passports.\r\nRehabilitation of abaca lands discussed with officials of the U. S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, U. S. Commercial Company, and Alien Property Custodian.\r\nEstablishment of a consulate in Hawaii after July 4, 1946.\r\nSending by the United States of missions to consult on technical phases of the rehabilitation program.\r\nStatus of Filipinos in the United States after independence.\r\nLegislation granting an immigration quota to the Philippines and providing for naturalization rights in the United States for Filipinos. Also legislation to continue the civil service status for- Filipino employees of the U. S. Government.\r\nRequest to officials of the War and Navy departments for the transfer to the Philippines of equipment for the Philippine Army and for a Coast Guard; request for assignment of supplies and subsistence for these forces for a temporary period.\r\nAcceleration of reparations deliveries of machinery and industrial equipment from Japan.", "title": "The State of the Nation"},
{"delivered": "1947-01-27 12:07:40+00:00", "author": "Manuel Roxas", "text": "\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Second Session, Manila on January 27, 1947]\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\nEight months ago I made my first report to you on the state of the nation. I did not draw a bright picture. I did not attempt to gloss over the tragic aspects of the scene that confronted us. I told as truly as I could of the mountainous problems we faced.\r\nSix months ago we became a Republic. That development was the most transcendental of our history. You have assembled in the second regular session of the First Congress of the Republic. I can report today with deep satisfaction that this nation has ceased to retreat in disorder and confusion; it is moving courageously and confidently forward on the road to national health. We are well into a period of progress. The clouds of gloom which hovered over us eight months ago have dissipated. Hope and resolution have replaced despair and doubt; plan and program have come forward in place of distraction and aimless- ness; our economy is taking shape; peace and order have returned; employment is gradually increasing; business prospers; our exports are mounting daily; assistance of many kinds from the United States has come, and more is on the way.\r\nI cannot report that our crisis is past. Such a claim would be obviously false. I shall speak in some detail of our still critical condition, and of the heroic efforts which are yet required for national success. What I bring is a message of hope and good cheer in this: we have gathered our forces, organized them and laid out our battle plans. We are no longer in disorganized flight. We have won initial victories on many fronts. We have every reason to believe that success can be ours.\r\nI should be remiss if I did not tell you how deeply the nation is indebted to the collective wisdom of last year\u2019s sessions of Congress. It was you who enacted the laws, who issued the directives and granted the authority permitting the Government to undertake the measures, which have turned out so salutarily for our people. I have every reason to be humbly grateful to Congress for the cooperation given to me and to the Administration, in the enactment of recommended measures. Congress can claim the major share of the credit for whatever progress we have made.\r\nI look forward to the same cooperation and friendliness in this session, the same unselfish devotion to the welfare of the nation, the same farsighted courage which will guide you, I trust, to further acts of bold resolution, and of courageous consideration of our problems. This is no time for hesitation or timidity. This is no time to draw back. This is the hour to press forward on all fronts, and to pursue with all vigor the advantages we have already gained.\r\nWe have, within the past eight months, established firmly the basis of independent government. We have gained, in full measure, the confidence of the vast majority of our people, and of all the groups of our population. Labor, farmers and tenants, merchants, importers and exporters, producers and middlemen, all know, and have good reason to know, that we are engaged in endless operations to insure adequate protection and advancement of their interests. In some cases, the interests of one group have had to be reconciled with the interests of another. In some cases, one group has had to be curtailed in its quest for power or profit in order to promote the welfare of the people as a whole. Yet all the groups know or should know that the Government weighs the interests of each, finally using as the touchstone of desirability the abiding welfare of the entire Filipino people.\r\nThe inertia, which we found in the Government eight months ago, has been overcome. Most government agencies have been assigned their individual problems in connection with rehabilitation and reconstruction. These agencies and departments are now producing the results, which we expect of them.\r\nSome government agencies are still functioning at a lesser level of efficiency. The Administration is doing its best, however, to sweep away the cobwebs of red tape, delay, confusion and dishonesty from all the branches of government in every part of the Philippines.\r\nThese eight months have been months of critical developments. We have been fighting our way forward and have been required at the same time to settle among ourselves questions of basic policy which were and still are agitating portions of the public. From the welter of confusion and contradiction, there has, however, emerged the clear will of the Filipino people and nation. In accordance with that will, as I interpret it, the Government has taken many actions and entered into many arrangements, which have resulted in progress toward national rehabilitation. I shall summarize briefly the steps taken and the advances made during the past eight months and enumerate in the same manner the problems we still face.\r\nThe Philippine Government and nation have accomplished the following in the past months:\r\nWe have reestablished complete peace and order through- out the Philippines, except in a few limited areas in Central Luzon.\r\nWe have arrested the upward trend of the cost of living and in the case of our basic commodity, rice, we have virtually halved its cost to consumers. We have successfully fought the black market and our people are assured of an adequate rice supply this year.\r\nWe have set up a system of rationing of rice and other commodities in centers of population, a system which has been kept free of graft and corruption.\r\nWe are enforcing a rent control Act passed by the last session of Congress, resulting in a decrease in rentals in some cases, and an increase in government revenues through higher assessments in others. Ousters of tenants in efforts to increase rental returns have been curtailed.\r\nWe have, to some extent, broken the bottleneck of critical construction materials, including cement from our own sources; long-delayed construction and repair have started on a gradually increasing scale.\r\nAn agrarian reform program has been begun. The 70-30 formula for the division of the rice crop between tenant and landowner is being enforced everywhere. Church estates are in process of being purchased for redistribution to tenants. Plans are being made for waterpower development and expansion of irrigation systems.\r\nWe are beginning to mechanize production of rice. We have made available for sale to private individuals and have disposed to government entities more than 1,000 tractors obtained in surplus property from the United States. Many have already been sold. Some are already in use.\r\nWe have arranged to obtain much needed plows, and other agricultural implements, from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to the value of P6,000,000, without cost to us.\r\nWe were able to obtain, in addition, through insistent representations to UNRRA, an allocation of approximately P8,000,000 in emergency supplies, foodstuffs and other materials. These are now being delivered to the UNRRA here and are being distributed as needed.\r\nThrough effective mediation and conciliation, we have forestalled major strikes in private industry and agriculture and have established the basis of labor peace.\r\nWe have increased our production of copra to pre-war levels and our production of abaca to 60 per cent of pre-war amounts. Unprecedented prices for these two commodities have brought a measure of prosperity to producers. We have insured a maximum return to the producers from the high market prices.\r\nA threatened famine was averted by an all-out food production campaign, with emphasis on rice substitutes. Part of our rice deficit was met by government importations from Siam, the United States and Ecuador.\r\nWe have so utilized our emergency medical supplies and so organized our sanitation and health services as to prevent any serious epidemics and have successfully safeguarded the public health. Our hospitals are being gradually rehabilitated, and conditions in them improved.\r\nGovernment revenues, although far from sufficient, have reached a total, which can compare favorably with our pre-war government income. It is five times what some anticipated eight months ago.\r\nIn accordance with the Reorganization Act of the last session of Congress, we have launched a thorough-going overhauling of the government machinery to achieve maxi- mum efficiency and economy in government operations. While this study has been underway, I have suspended the filling of vacant positions except in a few cases of public necessity.\r\nUnder the terms of the Philippine Veterans Bill of Rights, we have established a Veterans Board, which is extending maximum available aid to Filipino veterans.\r\nGuerrilla amnesty commissions have been set up, under congressional authority, to examine cases of guerrillas charged with crimes committed in furtherance of the resistance movement. Charges of crimes against persons and property, clearly in furtherance or deemed at the time to be in furtherance of the war effort, have been ordered dismissed. These commissions are well along with their work. Hundreds of guerrilla officers and men have been freed from jail and cleared of pending accusations.\r\nWater and land transportation facilities have in large part been reestablished. We have begun the rehabilitation of the Manila Railroad. We are arranging the transfer to private operation of interisland vessels made available to us as surplus property by the United States Government. We are assisting private operators to acquire by purchase or charter larger vessels for transoceanic routes.\r\nThere have been initiated the first international Philippine airline services. Interisland air transportation facilities have been increased. We are in the process of strengthening our Bureau of Aeronautics to regulate and stimulate the further expansion of the aviation industry.\r\nWith the aid of the United States, we are arranging for a vast program of construction and repair of public roads and bridges. With the aid of the United States, we are preparing to reconstruct our harbors and port works.\r\nWith the aid of the United States, we are in the process of reorganizing and reestablishing our weather observation system, our air navigation system, our fisheries, our merchant marine, our coast and geodetic survey, our lighthouse service, and other essential public facilities.\r\nWith the aid of the United States, we are beginning a large-scale program of public building construction and repair. We have already begun, on our own initiative and with our own funds, to rebuild schools, hospitals, roads and bridges. We have released this fiscal year P28,882,000 for this purpose.\r\nWe have largely reorganized and revitalized our courts and local and municipal governments. We have reestablished the Court of Appeals.\r\nWe have solved the urgent problem of congestion in Manila Harbor. Through a Harbor Commission established by Administrative Order, we are successfully coordinating harbor, dock, lighterage and warehouse facilities. A threatened embargo by foreign shippers on shipments to Manila was withdrawn. Ships now unload in normal time. Thefts, looting and pirating from ships, docks and warehouses have been greatly minimized.\r\nWe have, in considerable measure, reestablished our radio and postal communications among our cities and centers of population. We have reopened many radio and telegraph stations and postal offices. Money order facilities are again available in most areas.\r\nWe have acquired from the United States Government, without cost, a radio broadcasting station, which we are now operating. Educational and informational programs are being broadcast to the schools and to the general public. We are now studying plans for the permanent operation of this valuable informational facility.\r\nThe Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, authorized by the last session of Congress, has been duly organized and is already functioning.\r\nWe have rehabilitated most of our banking, insurance and other credit institutions, permitting them to operate on a sound basis. The Philippine National Bank has been revitalized, and has been able gradually to reduce interest rates and to make crop loans for the production of rice, sugar and other commodities. It has also been able to pay the pre-war deposits of those whose accounts were seized and transferred by the Japanese during the war. A number of other banks have followed suit.\r\nOur government corporations have been reorganized and given new programs of vital activities in the economic sphere. The National Development Company, the Agricultural Machinery and Equipment Corporation, the National Trading Corporation, the NARIC, the PRRA, the NAFCO, the National Tobacco Corporation and the NACOCO are all at work in essential undertakings. Most of these government entities are now operating on a sound business-like basis.\r\nWe have negotiated an Executive Trade Agreement with the United States under terms approved by the Philippine I Congress, providing for free trade and preferential trade, relations for a 28-year period. We are in the midst of the consideration of a constitutional amendment, approved by the last session of Congress, required for the implementation of the Trade Act. We have provided for a popular referendum on this amendment on March 11th.\r\nWe have made arrangements with the United States Government for the transfer to us without cost of surplus property for which the United States paid P1,274,000,000. A Philippine Surplus Property Commission has been organized and is in the process of taking over surplus property f depots and of disposing of such surplus property as is not, required by government agencies and instrumentalities. We have made sales amounting to over P10,000,000, excluding the proceeds from watercraft.\r\nWe have concluded arrangements with the United States for the transfer to us at nominal cost of former Japanese-owned lands, title to which had passed to the American Government. We are already operating the properties formerly owned by the Ohta and Furukawa interests. The Bureau of Lands has taken over 15,000 hectares of hemp and coconut lands and has transferred them to NAFCO for administration. Some of these lands were acquired as the result of the expiration of leases; the remainder are lands held by private individuals under illegal leases, which are now in the process of being voided.\r\nWe have received from the United States Government P50,000,000 ($25,000,000) in cash, plus certain amounts of surplus property, in discharge of obligations acknowledged by the United States as a result of the war. Of this amount, P30,000,000 has been earmarked for the retirement of outstanding and duly authorized guerrilla currency.\r\nWe are in the process of concluding arrangements for the training of 500 Filipinos annually in technical fields at the expense of the United States. Some of the training programs have already begun.\r\nConsistent with our new status as a Republic, we have organized a Foreign Affairs Department and a Foreign Service, and established an embassy at Washington and consular offices in a number of places abroad.\r\nWe have enhanced our international prestige by aggressive and brilliant representation in international bodies, including the United Nations and its instrumentalities, notably the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO.\r\nOur Republic has been recognized by 49 nations of the world. Legations of China, Great Britain, France and Italy, and consulates of many other countries are established here. We have negotiated a treaty of amity and friendship with the United States and expect shortly to sign a similar accord with China. We have negotiated and signed an air agreement and a treaty of conciliation with the United States, and are in the process of negotiating a number of other treaties covering commerce and navigation, reciprocal taxation, air transportation, and conciliation.\r\nNegotiations are in progress for the establishment of military bases in the Philippines to be maintained by the United States for the mutual defense of both countries.\r\nWe have received from the United States, without charge, arms and other equipment for our army and military police force.\r\nWe have tentatively arranged for the continued supply of the needs of our armed forces by the United States Army and Navy for the next five years. The same tentative arrangement provides for the transfer to us of84 naval vessels.\r\nWe have reestablished and expanded our public school system all over the country. Temporary buildings are being used in place of those destroyed. We have today a school enrolment of three million, compared with less than two million before the war.\r\nWe have established an effective system of export control and have thus retained in the Philippines scarce commodities necessary for consumption and rehabilitation.\r\nWe are in the process of reorganizing our army, stream-lining it, and providing the maximum incentive to able junior officers to advance in rank. We are aiming completely to democratize our army and inject new and vigorous blood, utilizing talent and leadership discovered in the war. An overall reorganization plan for our armed forces is being prepared.\r\nWe have, in all but name and administration, converted our military police into a civilian police force, subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\nWe have preserved our birthright of freedom and the forms and substance of democracy. We have fought and overcome the advances of totalitarianism. We have defended and expanded the frontiers of liberty. Nowhere is there a freer press, more unchecked freedom of thought, discussion and expression.\r\nThese are but titles on the pages of progress, which have been written, in eight swift months. I shall refer to some of these matters in greater detail. But first, I must summarize the problems and obstacles we still face.\r\nThe vast majority of our people are inadequately housed. The congestion and squalor in our cities are intense, threatening us with disease and epidemic.\r\nOur ruined sanitation and sewage systems in the cities and centers of population are a menace to public health. We have inadequate hospital and medical facilities to meet the needs of our people.\r\nThe majority of our buildings not only in Manila but also in most of our provinces and municipalities, are in ruins.\r\nOur public utilities, telephone lines, radio facilities, railroad, electrical power and light companies, and waterworks are in urgent need of additional rehabilitation, expansion, repair and replacement.\r\nMany of our roads are in a pitiful state of disrepair. Some of our most important bridges are still down.\r\nOur school facilities as a whole are still sadly inadequate because of destroyed school buildings, overcrowding and the shortage of trained teachers. We are conducting most of our schools in shifts, one group in the morning, another in the afternoon.\r\nOur government revenues are one-third of our authorized expenditures.\r\nSpeedy rehabilitation is necessary for our sugar, lumber, coconut oil, tobacco, cigar, and mining industries.\r\nOur economy is too much dependent on expenditures here by the United States, chiefly by the U. S. Army and Navy.\r\nOur agricultural methods, still largely dependent on the hand-plow and the carabao, must be modernized. Many of our farmers are even without work animals.\r\nOur livestock industry requires rehabilitation.\r\nToo many of our farmers till small plots of land in congested areas while too few are settled in our vast undeveloped areas. Too many farmers are tenants rather than owners of the lands they till. Too many of our citizens do not own the houses and homes in which they live. The cost of living is still too high.\r\nThe present degree of inflation is still excessive and abnormal.\r\nToo much of the energy of our businessmen is going into buy-and-sell, and not enough into production for consumption or export.\r\nToo large a proportion of business and retail trade is in alien hands. Filipinos have not yet succeeded in obtaining their proper participation in these pursuits.\r\nWe have vast resources, but they are undeveloped. We lack the capital and technical skills to keep pace with the 20th century. Our water power potentialities are practically untouched.\r\nMost of the cheap power and conveniences made available by modern science are still denied to a great majority of our people. Our veterans need speedy assistance to take their proper places in society.\r\nThievery, looting and banditry persist in some areas.\r\nSmall bands of lawless elements still roam on restricted areas of our land, engaging in acts of terror, intimidation I and gangsterism.\r\nA great number of firearms are still illegally held by unauthorized persons.\r\nOur courts are clogged with cases due to the great accumulation of cases during the war, a shortage of judges, and the destruction of records and of facilities.\r\nOur national economy is still too limited in scope to support the needs of an independent Republic and the legitimate requirements of our population.\r\nTo meet these problems and others I shall from time to time during the present session submit to you special messages dealing with specific situations and legislative proposals. I shall, within a few days, for instance, submit a budget message, outlining in detail our fiscal problems, prospects and program.\r\nWhat I have recited have been the headlines of my report on the state of the nation. There is much left which I feel it incumbent upon me to report to you and to the people regarding the Administration\u2019s program and problems during the past eight months and for the months directly ahead.\r\nOur most pressing problem eight months ago was peace and order. There were areas in this country where the equivalent of anarchy reigned\u2026groups caned Hukbalahaps and PKM\u2019s were usurping the authority of Government, with terror and violence as their instrument.\r\nWith the war over, the leadership of these organizations undertook to use the arms, which had been given them to fight the Japanese, to resist and to defy the lawful government of the Filipino people. When I assumed office, I was inclined to parley and reason with these people. Especially because some of them had been active in the resistance movement, I embarked upon a policy of tolerance and peaceful persuasion. We knew, of course, that there was some reason for the discontent existing in the area. The roots of the difficulties were set deep in the age-old tenant-landowner relationships and in the primitive production methods of the region. I determined upon the following program: first, to give assurance to the people that the Government intended to accomplish wide agrarian reforms; and, second, to strike with all possible speed at the roots of social discontent, in the hope of inspiring in the hearts of the common men and women of these provinces full faith and confidence in the Government\u2019s advocacy and support of their just interests. The Government made clear that the attack upon the causes of social discontent was to be multifold, and would include land redistribution and resettlement, modernization of agriculture, water power development, irrigation, and establishment of small industries\u2026in other words, a broad program to diminish the exclusive dependence of the people of Central Luzon on their limited agricultural production and to provide more equitable distribution of the land and of its products. Such a program would, we hoped, constitute an answer to the ancient riddle of Central Luzon.\r\nPending the development of this program, the Government at first withheld the use of all-out force in the reestablishment of peace and order in the disaffected areas. However, it soon became clear to all the people, and to the Government, that the leaders of these organizations were not interested in agrarian reforms or in improving the lot of the people, but only in holding power and in wielding it for their own oblique and peculiar purposes. Acts of terrorism and violence against the civilian population, against property and against the police, continued to be committed. By documents captured in the headquarters of these organizations, we ascertained that plots were laid to murder prominent citizens and leaders of government, including the President. I, therefore, gave final warning, by press, radio and air-borne pamphlets, that armed bands must disperse, that illegally-held arms must be given up, and that the majesty of government authority must be respected. I gave assurance that constitutional processes would be adhered to and gave every inducement to the lawless elements to call a peaceful halt to their activities. The Military Police Command was then directed to disperse all armed bands, to seize all illegally-held arms, and to apprehend all persons violating the law, assembling in armed groups, holding arms illegally, or committing acts of terrorism or banditry. I directed the MPC to observe at all times the constitutional guarantees. There was to be no search and seizure without authority; no suspension of individual rights, no terrorism against those charged with crimes.\r\nI can report to this Congress today that peace and order have been largely restored in Central Luzon. There are still a few isolated bandit units in hiding. Occasionally they conduct forays into some small barrios or towns. Swift counter-measures are being taken in such cases. There is no reason to call these groups by the name of Hukbalahap. They are not the people\u2019s army against the Japanese; they are not a guerrilla force; they have no unifying idea or purpose, except murder and plunder. They are law-breakers of the most vicious kind. A number of the leaders are escaped prisoners charged with murder, robbery, rape and other heinous crimes. I am informed that many plain bandits and criminals, gathered from other provinces, including Manila, now pass themselves off as Hukbalahaps, to gain some sort of sanction for their activities. If\r\nhowever, there are truly elements which are still uninformed of the Government\u2019s beneficent intentions, if that is possible, then I shall continue to exercise a certain amount of tolerance for those who wish to give up their arms and to make their peace with the law. They are our fellow countrymen, some of them served gallantly in the war, and we can do no less. But for the incorrigibles, the deliberate flouters of government authority, there will be no excuse or consideration. Peace and order must be preserved\u2026by the will of the Filipino people, it will be preserved.\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has advised me that a total of 159,099 firearms have been confiscated, surrendered and registered with the authorities thus far. However, I am not satisfied with the situation. There are still a large number of arms illegally held by private individuals in this country. In Lanao, during my recent visit, I saw 5,000 arms of various kinds and sizes, which had been surrendered to the local authorities. These included machine-guns, mortars, grease guns, automatic rifles, pistols, and many others. The day I visited Dansalan, I accepted the surrender by one datu of over 500 rifles, several machine-guns, and other automatic weapons. Incidentally, I found Lanao in most major respects restored to complete normalcy as far as peace and order are concerned. Cattle thievery and a form of indentured labor or slavery were the only exceptions to this situation. Steps are being taken to terminate both these practices.\r\nAlmost everywhere I went\u2014in Mindanao, in the Visayas, from Davao to Marinduque\u2014peace and order had been restored. Travel after dark is safe and routine. Houses may be left unlocked and automobiles unguarded. There are but few exceptions to this situation.\r\nIn some cases the local police are seriously remiss in their duties. I have recommended on many occasions, to numerous municipalities, that it is better that the local police be reduced in number but paid sufficiently to assure absolute honesty. I would rather have a police force of two honest men in a town than a police force of 20 men of uncertain integrity.\r\nIn my message to the Congress on the state of the nation in June, last year, I proposed that the Military Police Command be eventually converted into a civilian police force under the Department of the Interior. I have caused a study to be made of the exact mechanics of carrying out this program. It is rather complex, involving the benefits that accrue to the members of the MPC under their present military status, and also the matter of supply and equipment for the MPC, much of which is now coming from the United States Army. I urge the approval of proper legislation as soon as practicable, subject to a deferment of its effectiveness until the financial problems involved can be met.\r\nIn regard to the status and structure of the Government itself, the Congress knows that there is going on a thorough study of this entire matter.\r\nA non-partisan and non-political Board appointed by the Chief Executive is now at work preparing a comprehensive report on the reorganization of government departments, agencies, bureaus and divisions. I directed the Reorganization Board to attempt to accomplish a saving of at least 25 per cent in government expenditures, and to promote simplicity and efficiency in government operations. I have received portions of that report already. I am making a very careful review and will effect such reorganizations as are in the best interests of the country. Congress gave the President one year to accomplish this reorganization. I shall proceed slowly in the use of that authority. Some of the changes to be made will be reflected in the budget to be submitted to you. Other reorganization measures will be effected as the study of them is completed. Congress will be kept informed.\r\nThe morale of the Government is, on the whole, high. The efficiency of our agencies and offices is improving. Cases of inefficiency have been dealt with by suspension or by assignment to other posts for which the individuals are better qualified. Cases of dishonesty have been summarily dealt with and continue to be dealt with in that fashion by dismissal and, in some cases, by prosecution under due process of law. I hear from time to time of instances of graft and corruption in the Government. Every case brought to my attention is promptly and thoroughly investigated, and suitable action taken. It is, perhaps, true that a certain tolerance has developed among some of our officials towards minor forms of bribery and favoritism. This is partly traceable to the general moral laxity, which set in under the cynical rule of the Japanese. We must do our best to eliminate, to stamp out, and to punish all such laxity. The government service must be the model of incorruptible integrity, an example for the nation. There is no greater imperative need confronting us, no more serious problem than the healing of this purulent disease which has appeared in our national bloodstream. I shall welcome proper legislation to increase penalties for such crimes and make punishment more speedy and certain.\r\nI realize that many of our government employees are underpaid. I realize that the standard of wages and salaries is considerably lower than that available today in some branches of business and industry. The Government is helpless to do anything at this time to raise the general standard of wages and salaries. Every centavo, which we have or can obtain, is needed for essential public purposes. We are doing our best to make every possible saving and to reduce expenditures in order to stretch out our available funds over as many functions as possible. Many activities and undertakings duly authorized by Congress cannot be carried out because of lack of funds. Other essential obligations must be curtailed for the same reason.\r\nIt must be remembered that as we are now obtaining in government income only about one-third of our authorized expenditures, the remainder of our needs must be met by borrowing. Every peso that we spend above our income is a debt, which we must surely repay. Although some of our fellow citizens are prospering in trade and commerce, the Government is receiving an income which, if we were unable to borrow money, would require us to abandon our Army, disband our military police, shut down half of our schools, suspend our health activities, our aids to agriculture, our public works, and dismiss two-thirds of our civil service employees. We must, therefore, realize that we cannot at this time do justice to all the deserving. We are trying, by every means at our command, to bring down the cost of living, so that present wages and salaries will be somewhat more adequate to meet essential requirements of livelihood.\r\nWe hope to be able to borrow from abroad during the next five years necessary amounts to meet the ordinary expenses of government. At the end of five years, our budget\r\nbe balanced. We must not borrow any more money for budgetary purposes after that, and we must immediately begin to repay what we have borrowed. We dare not fail in this. We must maintain our government credit at all costs and at all sacrifices. We must make sacrifices now.\r\nI know of no more underpaid group of government employees than our teachers, although they are receiving twice their pre-war salaries. I know of no more important function than theirs. Yet we can only promise them\u2026a promise which I mean to carry out\u2026that justice will be done them as soon as is humanly possible. I make a similar promise to the rest of our employees. We can only ask them to be patient and to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to bridge over the critical period.\r\nWe have had, during the past eight months, very few strikes. The biggest strike was that of some government laborers in Manila. I have already made clear my policy with regard to strikes of government workers. I will not permit strikes against the Government. There have been no other outstanding strikes during the past eight months. We have had, in general, a period of labor peace. The Court of Industrial Relations is functioning well; the Secretary of Labor and his subordinates have been constantly vigilant to head off strikes with official and unofficial mediation efforts. A number of threatening situations have thus been averted. This has been a leading factor in the progress we have made toward a restoration of normalcy in the labor field. The Government has had the cooperation, in this, of both labor and management. A continuation of this situation is absolutely vital to continued progress in rehabilitation. I assure organized labor, and all men who work, that the Government will do them justice. The Government stands ready to mediate any labor dispute or any threatened labor dispute. That is an essential function of government. I give my pledge to labor unions and to workers throughout the Philippines that I will do my best to see that they get the fairest and squarest possible deal from employers if labor, in turn, will do its best to insure labor peace and to increase our productive capacities to the utmost. That is what we need most of all in the months ahead\u2026production, production, and more production.\r\nI recommend to Congress legislation to augment the authority of the Government to mediate in labor disputes. The Division of Mediation should be strengthened with adequate personnel. Our fundamental labor conciliation Jaw should be modified so as to provide for mediation before a strike has taken place, and before reference of the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations. I believe the Department of Labor should certify cases to the Court of Industrial Relations only when voluntary mediation and conciliation fail. This is in line with the trend in other countries. I think it will be found that, in most cases, voluntary mediation will be successful. This, in turn, will relieve the Court of Industrial Relations of the tremendous overload of work, which now burdens it.\r\nIn the matter of local governments, I am much pleased by the initiative and leadership shown by many of our local officials. I believe firmly in a maximum measure of decentralization of government authority. The only criterion should be the capacity of local governments to absorb and successfully discharge increased responsibilities.\r\nAt the last session of Congress, an Act was passed permitting the election of provincial and municipal officials in the special provinces. As soon as I am convinced that the majority of the people of these provinces desire to assume this responsibility, I shall be happy to issue the necessary proclamation. On the first of this month, the province of Romblon was reconstituted\u2026another step in the same general direction.\r\nAs a result of considerable shifts and redistribution of population, and the natural growth of population, our system of classification of provinces and municipalities is out of date, and a readjustment is long overdue. I shall recommend that some legislation be enacted at this session of Congress to fix the date of the next readjustment, and to prescribe a suitable basis for such readjustment. Likewise, I recommend that the Congress consider a revised scale of maximum salaries for local officials and employees.\r\nAs directed by Congress, I have appointed a commission to make a thorough study of the present system of local governments, and to report on proposals to achieve, in local governments, greater economy, efficiency and autonomy.\r\nThat commission has already begun to function. As soon as its report is received, I shall make the indicated recommendations to Congress. Just as I believe in greater autonomy for local governments, I also believe that they should, at the earliest possible date, assume an increased fiscal responsibility for their own affairs. The National Government must be relieved, as soon as possible, of the support of provinces, cities and municipalities which can afford, by improved methods of tax collection and new taxes, to maintain themselves, especially their schools, roads and hospitals.\r\nThe constitutional amendment for the grant of certain special rights to American citizens in the development of our natural resources and the operation of public utilities has already been acted upon by the Philippine Congress, and now faces a popular referendum. This matter has been so much discussed, that I shall not refer to it in detail in this message. I am happy to be able to report, however, that the Filipino people, having been acquainted with the true facts regarding the proposal, will, I am sure, overwhelmingly approve this amendment and open the way for our speedy national rehabilitation and industrial development.\r\nIn order to acquaint the people with the facts concerning this proposal, to inform them of what the Government is doing to advance rehabilitation, and to acquaint myself with the individual problems of the various provinces and municipalities, I have, during the past two months, made a number of visits throughout the country. Nothing which I have done during my eight months in office has given me greater satisfaction or a greater feeling of intimacy with our people. I have had an opportunity to listen to the views of provincial and municipal officials, of representatives of tenants, landowners, laborers, operators, market vendors, government employees and many others. I have had a chance to see with my own eyes the energies and anxieties of our people for the achievement of our national goals. I have had an opportunity to answer doubts, to grant allocations of funds for approved projects, to discuss health control measures, and to comprehend, more clearly than ever, the needs of the nation, not from the representations of callers at Malaca\u00f1an, not from the reports of government departments, but from first-hand observations of the people in their homes, in their towns and in the countryside. I was accompanied on these tours by members of the Cabinet, by congressional leaders, and by government experts in various fields of activity. Each of my colleagues benefited immeasurably from his contacts in his fields of operation. We have seen some of our government bureaus, offices, courts and fiscals working under almost impossible conditions, because of shortage of funds or facilities. In most cases, they were carrying on their duties in an efficient and orderly manner. I was so pleased with the results of these visits that I hope to make it a practice, once a year, to visit every province in the Philippines.\r\nWhen we became independent on July 4, 1946, we were in some measure already involved in world affairs. The United States Government, in its wisdom, had already introduced us to the world scene. We had long been a member of the United Nations, of the Pacific War Council, and many other bodies, long before we were an independent republic. But in spite of the recognition thus accorded us, we were still uncertain as to how we would be received when we became an independent republic. The United States invited all the countries, which maintain friendly relations with her to recognize our independence. Our first international treaty, a Treaty of Amity and Friendship, was of course signed with the United States. Our second international instrument, the Executive Trade Agreement, was also signed with the United States. Our independence was simultaneously recognized by more than a score of the great and small nations of the world. To date we have been formally recognized by 49 different countries. Only one of the Great Powers has not yet officially acknowledged our independent existence.\r\nThe last Congress authorized the creation of a Department of Foreign Affairs. To the high post of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, I appointed, with the assent of the Commission on Appointments, the Honorable Elpidio Quirino, Vice President of the Philippines. Vice President Quirino organized his Department, and submitted to Congress a plan for the creation of a Foreign Service. The Congress approved that plan and we have attracted many of our most brilliant young minds into that service.\r\nWe have established an Embassy in Washington which will be, for the time being, our only embassy. We have opened Consulates-General in New York, San Francisco and Honolulu, and a consulate in Amoy. We propose during this year, to establish legations in London and Nanking and perhaps elsewhere, and to increase the number of consulates.\r\nIn the conduct of our foreign policy, I have laid the greatest emphasis on our representation in the United Nations and in other international bodies. I shall continue to do so. I named members of Congress to be delegates to some of the recent international meetings and I shall continue that practice. These members represented us most creditably and with honor to themselves and to our nation. I should like to see the foreign policy of the Philippines brought as closely home to the people as possible. I should like the world to know and to meet the members of our Congress and share the respect that I have for the high caliber of our democratic representation. Through the work of our international representatives and delegations, and of Dr. Carlos P. Romulo, our Permanent Delegate to the United Nations, we have gained prestige in the eyes of the World.\r\nOur foreign policy has been well defined. It is non-partisan and non-political, as befits us as a nation. I have selected, as representatives to numerous international bodies, members of both political parties. I shall continue to follow this practice. Politics must halt at the water\u2019s edge. There must be no partisan considerations in our conduct of affairs with other nations. To the world we must present a united, indivisible and determined front.\r\nOur foreign policy, as laid down and implemented during the past year, has now become clear to all. We yield to no nation of the world in our allegiance to the ideals of the United Nations, in our all-out support of collective security, of world disarmament at the earliest possible date, of world guarantees of noninterference in the internal affairs of free peoples, of world cooperation for the protection and promotion of all the freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom from want, and of world cooperation to abolish trade barriers and discriminatory trade provisions.\r\nYet we also adhere to our primary relationship with the United States of America, a nation which gave us our II freedom, and which is doing so much to preserve it. We must preserve at all costs our intimate relationship with that great country, which stands today as the champion of our principles in world affairs. Many economic advantages which could not otherwise be obtained have been and will be available to us as a result of our special ties with that country.\r\nI need not report in detail on surplus property. You are aware of the transaction which took place on September the first, which made available to the Philippine Government surplus property at $637,000,000 procurement cost. All surplus property that is not required by government agencies and subdivisions is being sold to the general public, with a general priority for our veterans. We have received an average return of over 25 per cent of the procurement cost on sales made up to now. The returns from these sales are being assigned, as provided by law, to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation to serve as capital assets. Small boats and watercraft being given us as surplus property can be converted into fishing vessels, or be used for short-haul passenger and cargo transport. For inter-island traffic, there are being turned over to us 44 FS-type vessels of an original cost to the United States of over P400,000 each. A present value of P200,000 for each of these vessels has been set. We are offering them for sale to Philippine carriers, with preference to pre-war carriers. Failing that, the Government proposes to charter these vessels to private shippers for limited periods. With these facilities, our inter-island shipping bottoms will be more than 60 per cent of pre-war tonnage.\r\nAt the same time, we are endeavoring to buy large ocean-going vessels from the United States Maritime Commission. Philippine citizens and the Philippine Government have been granted priority immediately after American citizens in the acquisition of these vessels. In effect, we have the same priority as American citizens. We are trying to acquire several refrigerator ships to carryon trade in meat and other perishables with Australia. We are trying to buy other large vessels to transport rice and carabaos from Siam, Indo-China and other countries.\r\nWe must make every effort to build up a merchant marine. I intend to propose, at this session of Congress, legislation making it attractive to foreign ships engaged in foreign trade to register under the Philippine flag. I am recommending the establishment of a Maritime Commission. For the time being, the Shipping Commission, set up by administrative order to dispose of the ships we acquired as surplus property, is exercising some of the functions of the proposed permanent Maritime Commission.\r\nI look forward to the development, somewhere in the Philippines, of a free port, to serve as a transshipment point for trade with Asia and Australasia. I think that if we create the proper conditions in the Philippines, our country can become the hub of trade, commerce and transportation between the Orient and the Occident.\r\nWe are, as you know, in the midst of negotiations for an agreement for bases for the mutual protection of the Philippines and the United States. Actually such an agreement is only an implementation of the commitments and agreements made between the Philippine and United States Governments during the war and immediately thereafter. In these commitments and agreements the Philippine Congress has fully concurred. The exact location of the bases and other military establishments to be maintained here by the United States has been engaging the concentrated attention of the officials of both Governments. I am able to report to you that the United States Government has shown every disposition to consider our wishes in this matter. It has in no instance been arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable in the location of the base sites.\r\nRecently the American Government showed extreme anxiety regarding press reports that fundamental relations between the Philippines and the United States were being endangered by the presence of American troops here. It is my judgment that those press reports were largely inaccurate. Partly as a consequence of these reports the United States recently expressed herself as perfectly willing to withdraw all military forces from the Philippines, unless we desired otherwise. America, however, recognized her basic commitment to underwrite the security of the Philippines, in accordance with our wishes. When I advised the American Government that the Philippine Congress by unanimous resolution had agreed to the establishment of American bases here, and that the Filipino people desired the retention of these bases, it was decided to carry out the original program. To test the validity of this assurance that I had given, I polled the people in several of the base areas, notably in Guiuan and in Stotsenburg, as to whether they wished the bases to stay. In Guiuan there was a unanimous and full-throated expression of approval. It was the same everywhere I asked. I am informed that this is the sentiment of the people in Olongapo, in Cavite, and elsewhere.\r\nI have been entirely motivated in these decisions and attitudes by a determination that we must not be left undefended. I cannot, in good conscience, overlook the absolute necessity of guaranteeing our security by every and all means available to us. In this troubled and critical period of world history, to do otherwise would be to betray our sacred trust.\r\nThe establishment of these bases, not for aggression but for defense, will guarantee our own safety and advance the cause of world peace and security, which is the aim of the United Nations.\r\nPresent plans, however, provide a much less ambitious schedule of bases than was originally contemplated. I believe that the views of our negotiators will be met; the basic guarantee of Philippine security remains.\r\nSince the matter of the conduct of American troops here became of general concern, conditions have rapidly improved to a point where these troops and forces have again become welcome guests in our land. For this, we must thank both the diplomatic representative of the United States in the Philippines and Major-General George Moore, whose prompt and energetic actions resulted in a speedy elimination of the causes of difficulties that had existed. Our relations with the United States Army today are satisfactory .The Army and all its personnel are assisting us in every possible way. With few isolated and probably inevitable exceptions, the American troops are conducting themselves in a manner that reflects credit and honor upon the United States Government. The same of course also holds true for the United States Navy, through the splendid cooperation of Admiral Good. I expect that the base agreement will be signed within a short time. I will then report upon it to the Congress.\r\nImmediately following the signature of the base agreement, I shall undertake to reach an agreement with American authorities on a broad military assistance program, in accordance with the terms of the authorization by the United States Congress. This agreement will provide: (1) the United States will send a military mission to advise our Army and Navy in their organization and training; (2) the United States Army will provide our forces with assistance and cooperation during the next five years; (3) the United States Navy will turn over to us 84 ships for our offshore patrol, some of which will be available for use as lighthouse tenders and customs and immigration patrol boats. Among these ships will be a number of cargo vessels which will enable us to supply our forces stationed on our various islands. While not being used for these purposes, these vessels will be available for the hauling of critical cargo for government purposes. I do not know what we would do, how we could prevent illegal immigration and smuggling, and other illegal practices if these ships were not being made available to us. The United States Navy has but recently completed preliminary training of our offshore patrol personnel to take over, maintain and operate these vessels.\r\nIn regard to other aspects of our national defense, we face a vital question. That is the training of our citizen army under the terms of Commonwealth Act No.1. We have not carried on this training program since the liberation, depending upon the military training program in our schools and colleges to produce our trained reserves. Obviously, this is not a democratic method; it does not reach equally into our man-power reserve. Moreover, it does not give us the 10,000 trained men per year which is our goal. Nevertheless, I judge that it is more essential during the next years to concentrate the labor force of the nation upon reconstruction and rehabilitation than to divert 10,000 young men for military training. I shall therefore continue the suspension of the training program at least until 1948. With our security underwritten by the United States, I think that we can take the calculated risk of temporarily reducing the emphasis upon our own defense measures and concentrate upon the monumental tasks of rehabilitation.\r\nToday we have some unemployment, but less than what we had eight months ago. We may expect a continuation of unemployment for some months to come. This is due to the shortage of building materials, the timidity of capital, and the lack of suitable conditions for large-scale construction. I expect that with the approval of the parity amendment, with the increase in the availability of building materials from the United States and with the release of funds for rehabilitation purposes by the War Damage Commission, this situation will disappear and that all who are willing to work will be able to find employment.\r\nThe United States War Damage Commission, after a necessarily slow start, is now getting into a position where it can begin to make some payments to private individuals and to make allocations to the National Government for repair and reconstruction of public facilities.\r\nIt may be necessary for the Congress to consider the imposition of controls on the allocation of building materials, and on the prices which can be charged for construction services, once money becomes available for reconstruction work. I am submitting this matter for your consideration and will present my final recommendations at a later time.\r\nAlthough we have relative prosperity in the marts of commerce, although the copra and abaca industries are relatively flourishing, our national income is still far below the minimum levels required for national existence. We still import three to four times the value of what we export, the difference being made up by the visible expenditures of United States Government agencies in the Philippines. We must rebuild our sugar mills, our coconut mills and our cigar factories and resume in as brief a time as possible our export of sugar, coconut oil and cigars to the United States. Many sugar fields are being rehabilitated in the expectation that the parity amendment will be approved. Very little reconstruction of sugar mills, however, has taken place. This must be expedited. We must take advantage of the free-trade provisions of the Executive Trade Agreement in order to obtain as much income as possible, in terms of government revenue and in terms of national production, not only from sugar and coconut oil but also from the cordage, tobacco, embroidery and pearl button industries. We must work endlessly, make whatever sacrifices and adjustments are necessary, to achieve this end.\r\nIn regard to public works projects under the War Damage Act, there has been established by executive order the Rehabilitation Board under the chairmanship of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. That board is charged with the study of a system of priorities in public rehabilitation and repair projects for submission to the federal government agencies in charge of these expenditures. The United States Congress has already appropriated $11,214,000 for this work during the coming months. The projects will be distributed in accordance with needs, with- out any political considerations. Every province and city that suffered damages will be provided for to the extent of available funds in proportion to the damage suffered.\r\nOur roads in every part of the country need major repairs. The Public Roads Administration of the United States is now represented in the Philippines and is making surveys in consultation with the Philippine Rehabilitation Board to determine priorities in allocations. I have recommended that these allocations be made to all the provinces and cities in proportion to their first, second, and third-class roads and with due consideration to the economic and military importance of those roads.\r\nThe United States Corps of Engineers, with the cooperation of our Harbor Commission, is working on plans for the repair, reconstruction and improvement of our harbor facilities, concentrating first on Manila, Cebu, lloilo, and the other ports of entry. A total of $9,960,000 has been made available for this work this year.\r\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board of the United States, with authorization for expenditures of P16,000,000, has undertaken the construction and operation of air navigation aids in the Philippines and to assist in the construction of a national airport for international commercial aviation. Officials of this agency are already here working on this problem. The purpose of this program is to facilitate our development as the aviation center of the Far East. As this program unfolds, I will ask Congress for whatever additional appropriation is necessary to carry this development to its proper conclusion.\r\nThe last session of Congress appropriated P57,065,000 for a public works program. The Government is releasing this amount as quickly as funds are available. Up to now this amount, plus the motor vehicle and gasoline funds, are financing all the public works now under way. I do not believe that we should appropriate as large an amount for the coming year, not only because we shall lack funds for the purpose but also because of the bottleneck which will be presented by the shortage of supplies and building materials.\r\nIn the construction of bridges I urge that a maximum number of toll bridges be erected. Past experience indicates that toll bridges not only pay for maintenance and repair but also liquidate the original investment. Some funds for such projects will be made available by the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation.\r\nThe National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation and the National Coconut Corporation have both been extremely active in insuring to producers of these products the maximum benefits from the high prices now prevailing. The NAFCO and the NACOCO have established offices throughout the Philippines offering to buy abaca and copra at a minimum fair price. If the producers can obtain a higher price elsewhere, the Government is pleased to have the purchases made by private interests. The Government\u2019s sole purpose is to insure the producers a fair return. The purpose is not to compete with private buyers, middlemen or exporters in the acquisition of copra, abaca or other commodities. In line with our general agricultural program, the Government is intensifying its studies of new products such as ramie fiber, which can be produced in many places in the Philippines and marketed abroad. We are also stimulating the production of cotton, peanuts, rubber, cacao, cashew nuts, and soybeans for local consumption and for export. These efforts will be intensified this year; every encouragement will be given to the development of such production as is found commercially feasible.\r\nResettlement of new lands is a cardinal point of our agrarian reform program. These lands will be distributed to the landless and to tenants on easy terms. The former Japanese-owned lands in Davao and elsewhere deeded to us by the United States Government will be distributed on this basis. The same will be true of the estates, which we are acquiring from the Catholic Church. This latter negotiation, which will be completed within a few days, brings to a happy conclusion negotiations and discussions which have been under way for the last 20 years. We are acquiring these properties at approximately their pre-war assessed value. They will be subdivided and sold at cost to the persons working the lands or to those who have built their homes there.\r\nThe law passed by the last Congress, at the recommendation of the administration, providing for a 70-30 rice crop division has been put into effect all over the Philippines and will be enforced with full vigor.\r\nWe are now studying a fair standard of division or rental for sugar lands.\r\nWe must accelerate our geological surveys and provide adequate funds for them so as to locate new sources of minerals and other geological materials for the use of industries and mills. We must rehabilitate our fishing industry not only with boats acquired from the United States but by the construction of fishing boats in this country.\r\nThe United States Government, under the terms of the Tydings Rehabilitation Act, will itself carry out a large-scale program designed to promote our fishing industry. Fishermen will be trained in scientific and practical fishing techniques. Experimental fisheries will be established and our depleted streams and lakes will be restocked. One practice, which must be halted, is dynamiting. Increased penalties must be provided against this vicious, selfish and unpatriotic method of catching fish.\r\nThe United States Government is providing an overall training program for 500 Filipino students annually in the merchant marine, mineralogy, meteorology, fisheries, highway engineering, harbor engineering, and like fields of endeavor. These trainees are being named by me, subject to examinations, and in accordance with qualifications set up by the responsible United States agencies.\r\nThe Department of Justice reports that during the past year 15,353 cases were disposed of by the Courts of First Instance. There were 16,985 cases pending at the beginning of 1946; there were 22,346 cases pending at the end of1946. During the year 1946, 20,714 new cases were filed. In other words, there were 6,000 more cases pending at the end of that year than at the beginning, despite the fact that the courts disposed of almost as many cases as were pending at the beginning of the year. This indicates that the work of our courts must be accelerated in order to insure speedy, swift and certain justice. I have done everything in my power to appoint competent judges on a non-political basis. We attempt to fill vacancies as rapidly as they occur. But 15 judges of Courts of First Instance are assigned to the People\u2019s Court. Sometimes we find it difficult to induce competent attorneys to accept judicial posts. One of the recommendations made by the Secretary of Justice, which will be submitted to you, is to increase the jurisdiction of justices of the peace, to provide them with original jurisdiction over cases where the amount involved does not exceed P1,000 and concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of First Instance where the amount involved exceeds P1,000 but is less than P2,000. This should serve to expedite justice and relieve the higher courts of the burden of cases, which can be disposed of at lower levels.\r\nI have already referred to our precarious fiscal position. A joint Philippine-American financial commission, created under the terms of an agreement between President Truman and myself, has been set up and is now at work in Manila. Its membership consists of men of outstanding talent and experience in government finance. The recommendations of the commission, when made, will be the subject of a special message to the Congress. Pending the submission of their report, I shall not recommend any special fiscal measures. The Congress knows, however, that I favor the creation of a Central Bank to give more flexibility to our currency and to provide adequate administration of credit and exchange. I will submit appropriate recommendations when the studies of this subject are completed.\r\nThe last session of Congress enacted legislation providing for the registration of pre-war currency issues and of the Victory issues; the expiration date set for registration was November 30, 1946, with authority vested in the President to extend this limit to February 28, 1947. We now find that this period for registration is insufficient. It is physic- ally impossible to complete the stamping of all treasury certificates in the reserve vault and in circulation within the specified time. Confusion and monetary chaos will inevitably result unless the period for stamping is further extended. I therefore ask the Congress to enact speedily a bill to authorize the issuance of treasury certificates not previously stamped with the seal of the Republic until January 31, 1948, and also to authorize the extension to the same date of the period during which unstamped certificates may be considered legal tender. Meanwhile the Government, by administrative process, is withdrawing as rapidly as possible all pre-war issues and is exchanging them with the Victory series. I propose that pre-war issues be declared non-legal tender after June 30 of this year, in order to accelerate their registration and conversion.\r\nThe Rehabilitation Finance Corporation set up under the authority of the last session of Congress is now functioning, with a capitalization consisting of the resources of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the P15,000,000 fund of the Financial Rehabilitation Board, the proceeds of the sales of surplus property, and the P50,000,000 recently transferred from the Exchange Standard Fund. This capitalization will be gradually increased until the full authorized capital of P300,000,000 is covered. The RFC will also issue small amounts of bonds during the coming year. The machinery of the RFC is being carefully set up to safeguard the loans to be made. The nation is depending heavily upon this organization to provide credit for vast numbers of essential rehabilitation projects and undertakings.\r\nMeanwhile, other government corporations and entities will proceed with various programs to be integrated with the master plan of rehabilitation, and to be financed by the RFC. The National Power Corporation has been instructed to expedite its surveys of power projects and its submission of such projects as will be evidently self-liquidating. The National Development Company is engaged in similar planning. The National Land Settlement Administration, the Manila Railroad Company, and the Metropolitan Water District are also so engaged. I urge provincial and municipal governments to organize their plans for self-liquidating projects along similar lines. Private enterprises should make their applications in a like manner. The National Development Company has already set aside P5,000,000 to double the capacity of the Cebu Portland Cement Company and P800,000 for the reconstruction of the Insular Sugar Refinery.\r\nIn order to demonstrate to private business that it will have the same opportunity in economic undertakings as government entities, I recommend that the Congress make government corporations subject to the same taxes as private enterprise. Such a move will impress upon government corporations that they must conduct their activities on a business basis and must make the same provisions for taxation and other costs as private undertakings of the same kind. Some exceptions may be provided where government corporations are engaging in purely relief services.\r\nThe Philippine Veterans Bill of Rights enacted by the last session of Congress is operating satisfactorily. The Veterans Board has been established. The speed of its organization and the promptness with which claims are acted upon deserve commendation. I shall recommend in my budget message that the amount of money made available this year for the operations of this Board be continued next year. I have directed every agency of the Government to cooperate in the program of extending to our veterans every assistance authorized by law so that these men who: performed so valiantly in our country\u2019s darkest hour may have an equal opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and to assume their proper place in the life of the nation they did so much to preserve.\r\nThe present session of Congress will be called upon to reconsider a most difficult and controversial question in the settlement of the guerrilla currency problem. Thirty million pesos transferred to us by the United States Government has been earmarked for the retirement of guerrilla currency. It will be up to Congress to work out a practical formula for the redemption of this currency.\r\nThe registration of the guerrilla issues is now being effected. Until the registration is completed, you will be unable to act. Yet I urge Congress to begin the study of this matter, and to hold public hearings.\r\nIt is possible that additional amounts of money may later be made available for guerrilla currency redemption. That will depend upon our success in disposing of the portion of surplus property, which was given to us in consideration of this obligation.\r\nI am glad to report that the United States Government is moving swiftly to complete the payment of back pay to guerrillas. I have asked the United States Government to reconsider the question of back pay for USAFFE officers and men. I hope that justice will be done to them as well as to the guerrillas.\r\nA general review is now under way of all United States benefits available to Philippine veterans, in accordance with a request I made to President Truman. Some Philippine veterans\u2019 legislation, I am informed, will be introduced in the present session of the United States Congress. Additional benefits will be considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Veterans\u2019 problems composed of the United States Secretary of War, the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, and the Bon. Paul V. McNutt, American Ambassador to the Philippines. President Truman has made clear his feeling that our veterans should receive their due.\r\nIn the matter of payment of pensions to the widows and orphans of Filipino veterans and to disabled veterans, these payments are being adjudicated as fast as proper records can be reconstituted for the consideration of the Veterans Administration. The American Veterans Ad- ministration, dealing with 20,000,000 veterans, has rigid documentary requirements. It is inevitable that consideration of cases of Filipino veterans should involve delay.\r\nTo meet the problem of presenting carefully prepared claims not only to the Veterans Administration but also to the United States War Damage Commission, the Department of Justice is now organizing legal aid offices through- out the Philippines.\r\nOne of our sorest needs is the speedy rehabilitation of our schools and institutions of higher learning. In this period, of all periods, we require manpower trained in technological and vocational skills, as well as in the professions. A good share of the allocations for reconstruction of public buildings will be devoted to the reconstruction of our schools and of the University of the Philippines.\r\nUnder the United States cultural relations program, teachers, scientists and professors will be sent here from the United States. We should be ready, as soon as we can, independently to hire teachers from abroad and establish a school of physical science, and a department of industrial management. We must stimulate further scientific research, not only in our university but also in our government laboratories. I am studying a possible integration of government research laboratories and facilities, with the expectation of coordinating them with a projected Institute of Applied Science which I should like to see established to provide our industrial and agricultural enterprises, public and private, with assistance in improving their scientific techniques and methods.\r\nOur schools must continue to function in the teaching of liberal arts so that we may develop citizens trained in leadership and dedicated to the principles of democracy and freedom. An even greater awareness of these principles than we now have must be developed in our youth.\r\nFor some time past, there has been needless excitement over the question of the national language. The matter is truly a closed issue. By virtue of a constitutional mandate steps have been taken for the development and adoption of a common language. The Filipino national language was declared one of the official languages effective July 4, 1946. The Government will give every support to the propagation of the national language so that it may truly become, along with English, a common vehicle of communication among our people.\r\nIn view of the mutuality of our defense interests with those of the United States, I propose, at this session of Congress, that legislation be enacted permitting the enlistment of Filipino citizens in the American armed forces without forfeiture of citizenship. At the present time members of the Philippine Scouts and other Filipinos in the armed forces of the United States automatically lose their citizenship. I recommend that the Congress make forthright provision, during the effectiveness of the Bases Agreement with the United States, that Filipinos serving in the American armed forces may, at their election, retain their citizenship. I believe that this is just and proper, since the Filipinos engaged in this service will, I believe, .be stationed in the Philippines and Philippine waters and assigned to the defense of the Philippines. They should be honored rather than penalized.\r\nThe consistent thread running through the entire program I have outlined for the immediate future of our country is industrialization. This plan integrates with our power development projects, our vocational training program, our establishment of credit facilities, our promotion of geological researches and surveys, our invitation of American capital to invest here, and the proposed constitutional provision for special rights for American citizens. We will insure the fullest participation by Filipinos in this program.\r\nThe Government has commissioned a firm of industrial engineers and technologists to survey the industrial potentials of the Philippines. The same firm is now engaged in a survey of industrial equipment in Japan. This equipment may be made available to us in the form of reparations, of which we hope to receive early delivery. The final reparations settlement will take years to achieve but the United States and other allied nations are urging that intermediate deliveries of reparations equipment be made to damaged countries pending final settlement of percentage claims to be allowed each claimant-nation. The United States is leading the move for this program, although she herself does not expect to benefit from it. The American Government is, in a sense, merely acting as an advocate for the Philippines in this matter. I expect that we will soon receive from Japan a report on the equipment which could be useful here and which is available for reparations. At that time, we will present our claims.\r\nWe must be prepared to receive, install and operate this equipment. It will require a great outlay of money. Some of the money can be obtained in the form of loans from the RFC. In the case of major industrial operations, I propose to invite private enterprise here to operate these industries on a profit-sharing basis with the Government. There is no reason why the Philippines cannot capture a share of the former Japanese markets in this part of the world. No effort will be spared to achieve this goal.\r\nI have laid down for Congress today a lengthy list of subjects for its consideration. You will have little time for politics. You must, and I am sure you will, give your patriotic efforts to the matters before you. The work, which we undertake, can, perhaps, be simplified if we wish merely. to return to our pre-war economic level, or if we are content to remain among the small backward nations of the world. This nation is not so content. Just as we have high ideals, we must have high aspirations. We have on our side the proven courage of our people; we have in our young veterans and in our youth an ample reserve of ii patriotic manpower to carryon the battle with fierce and fervid devotion; we have hope and we have confidence that f we can accept the challenge that is presented to us to, achieve a national destiny as great as our dreams will permit.\r\nThe future is ours. The freedom and liberty of our people must be insured. Shall we mortgage the precious heritage of opportunity, which is now available to us out of fear or indolence? The voice of the entire Filipino people answers in single accord, \u201cNO.\u201d We will press forward, we will not retreat. We will not hide our heads in the swift-running sands of time, lest the sands run out, and leave us naked, backward and alone.\r\nWe will be resolute in our march toward our lofty goals\u2026carrying lightly the heavy burdens, which we now assume, in addition to those thrust upon us by Fate. We I will not abandon the contest. The greatness of our nation is at issue. The happiness and enduring welfare of our people are at stake. With the help of Almighty God, we will reach the summits we seek.", "title": "Message on the State of the Nation"}
